"'Prison was holiday camp compared to forced labour', court hears","Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and Lee Carbis, 34, deny several offences. They allegedly kept Michael Hughes, 46, and another man, 41, in ""appalling conditions"" at an industrial unit in Goole, East Yorkshire. Leeds Crown Court heard how Mr Hughes was allegedly ""routinely beaten"", forced to work 16-hour days, given only scraps of food and was doused in freezing cold water. In a video interview played to the jury, Mr Hughes said he had to sleep on a ""filthy"" piece of cardboard in a container. He claimed he was so hungry that he ate raw fish out of a bin, and at one point begged his captors to kill him, saying: ""I can't do this, I can't take it any more."" The court heard how Mr Hughes managed to escape and raise the alarm after 12 months of captivity. The jury was also shown a video of the other alleged victim, who was so malnourished and weak that he was only able to crawl on his hands and knees. Prosecutor Robert Smith QC said the defendants had treated their victims ""like animals"" and had ""exploited their vulnerability"". The defendants claim the two men were willing participants in a legitimate ""work placement"" scheme. Patrick Joseph Connors told the jury that Mr Hughes was ""free to come and go as he pleased"" and that he had never been assaulted. He said he had allowed Mr Hughes to sleep in the container because he had nowhere else to go. Patrick Dean Connors claimed that the other alleged victim had been ""lazy"" and had refused to work. He said he had given the man food and money and had even offered to help him find accommodation. The trial continues.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Delhi rape: PM promises to pursue panel recommendations,"Manmohan Singh wrote to the panel's head, ex-chief justice JS Verma, saying the report would be taken up promptly. The commission called for faster trials and longer sentences for convicted rapists, but not the death penalty. The brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December has sparked outrage in India and around the world. The case has reignited a debate about the safety of women in India and the need for tougher laws against sexual violence. The Verma Commission was set up in response to the public outcry over the Delhi rape case. The commission was tasked with examining the issue of sexual violence in India and making recommendations on how to prevent and respond to such crimes. The commission's report, which was released on 23 January, made a number of recommendations, including: Faster trials for rape cases Longer sentences for convicted rapists The establishment of special courts to deal with sexual violence cases The creation of a national registry of sexual offenders The provision of free legal aid to victims of sexual violence The government has welcomed the commission's report and has pledged to implement its recommendations. However, some activists have expressed concern that the government will not take sufficient action to address the issue of sexual violence in India. The Verma Commission's report is a significant step towards addressing the issue of sexual violence in India. However, it is important to remember that the report is only a first step. The government must now take action to implement the commission's recommendations. Only then will India be able to make progress towards becoming a safer place for women. In addition to the Verma Commission's recommendations, there are a number of other things that can be done to address the issue of sexual violence in India. These include: Education: It is important to educate people about sexual violence, including what it is, how to prevent it, and how to respond to it. Awareness: It is also important to raise awareness about the issue of sexual violence. This can be done through public service announcements, media campaigns, and social media. Support: Victims of sexual violence need support and assistance. This can include medical care, counseling, and legal aid. Prevention: It is also important to work to prevent sexual violence from happening in the first place. This can be done by creating safe environments, empowering women, and holding perpetrators accountable. By working together, we can create a safer future for women in India.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Bath and Bristol streets exceed EU pollution levels,"Data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Council showed nitrogen dioxide levels were more than twice the EU limit in some roads. Bristol City Council said reducing the amount of traffic to just essential journeys was one of many ways to improve air quality. ""We are legally required to meet EU limits on air quality, and we have a number of measures in place to help us do this,"" a spokesperson said. ""These include encouraging people to use public transport, walk or cycle instead of driving, and working with businesses to reduce their emissions."" Bath and North East Somerset Council said it was working on a number of initiatives to tackle air pollution, including promoting electric vehicles and installing electric vehicle charging points. ""We are also working with local schools and businesses to encourage them to reduce their emissions,"" a spokesperson said. ""We recognize that air pollution is a serious issue, and we are committed to doing everything we can to improve air quality in Bath and North East Somerset."" Air pollution is a major public health issue, and it is estimated to cause around 40,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant that is particularly harmful to respiratory health, and it can cause a range of problems, including asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. The EU has set a limit for nitrogen dioxide of 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m³). However, data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Council showed that nitrogen dioxide levels were more than twice this limit in some roads. For example, on the A4 in Bath, nitrogen dioxide levels were as high as 88 µg/m³, and on the M32 in Bristol, levels were as high as 82 µg/m³. These high levels of air pollution are a serious concern, and it is clear that more needs to be done to improve air quality in Bath and Bristol. One way to reduce air pollution is to reduce the amount of traffic on the roads. This can be done by encouraging people to use public transport, walk, or cycle instead of driving. Another way to reduce air pollution is to promote electric vehicles. Electric vehicles do not produce any emissions, so they are much better for air quality than petrol or diesel vehicles. Bath and Bristol councils are both working on a number of initiatives to tackle air pollution, but more needs to be done. The government needs to provide more funding for local councils to invest in public transport and electric vehicle charging points.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

London 2012: India 'to raise role of Dow Chemical',"The sports ministry told the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to convey its concerns, saying there was ""strong public sentiment"" on the issue. Dow has links to the firm behind the Bhopal disaster in 1984, which killed thousands of people. The IOA said it would meet Dow officials to discuss the issue. ""We will meet Dow officials and take up the matter with them,"" IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta told the BBC. ""We will convey the government's concerns and see what they have to say."" The Bhopal disaster was one of the world's worst industrial accidents. A leak of methyl isocyanate gas from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, central India, killed more than 3,000 people and injured hundreds of thousands more. Dow acquired Union Carbide in 2001. The Indian government has been pressuring Dow to pay compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. In 2010, the Indian Supreme Court ordered Dow to pay $2 billion in compensation to the victims. Dow has appealed against the ruling. The controversy over Dow's sponsorship of the London Olympics has put the Indian government in a difficult position. On the one hand, the government wants to support its athletes at the Olympics. On the other hand, it is under pressure from the public to take a stand against Dow. The IOA is now in the unenviable position of having to balance these competing interests. The IOA has said that it is committed to ensuring that the Indian team is able to compete at the Olympics. ""We want to ensure that our athletes are able to participate in the Olympics without any distractions,"" Mehta said. ""We will do everything we can to make sure that happens."" The IOA is also aware of the public sentiment on the issue. ""We are aware of the public sentiment on this issue,"" Mehta said. ""We will take that into account when we meet with Dow officials.""

Three teenagers arrive in Fiji after Pacific ordeal,"The boys, from the Tokelau Islands, a New Zealand-administered territory in the South Pacific, had been given up for dead. They had set off in a small boat on September 5 to go fishing but failed to return. An extensive search by the New Zealand Air Force and other agencies was called off after four days. However, on September 15, the boys were spotted by a passing fishing boat about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from their home island. They were taken to the Fijian island of Ono-i-Lau, where they were given medical attention. The boys, aged 15, 14, and 13, told rescuers that they had survived by eating fish and drinking rainwater. They said they had also used a sail to catch rainwater. The boys' families were overjoyed to learn that they were alive. They said they had never given up hope that their sons would be found. The boys' survival is a testament to their resilience and determination. It is also a reminder of the dangers that people face when they venture out into the open ocean. The Tokelau Islands are a group of three atolls located in the South Pacific Ocean. The islands are home to about 1,500 people. The islands are a New Zealand-administered territory. The boys' ordeal began when they set off in a small boat on September 5 to go fishing. They were planning to fish for a few hours and then return home. However, the weather conditions worsened, and the boys lost their way. The boys drifted for days, with no food or water. They eventually spotted a passing fishing boat and were rescued.

Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift,"Larry Fink, who runs BlackRock, said the shift will happen ""sooner than most anticipate"". His company has announced ""sustainable"" versions of its products and pledged that ""climate change"" would be a core investment conviction. ""We are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,"" Fink wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. ""The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance."" The value of assets that explicitly target environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors doubled to $40 trillion last year, according to investment research firm Morningstar. So far, much of the investment has been in equity markets, with a focus on renewable energy stocks. But Fink believes this is just the start. ""We are entering a 'new era of investing',"" he said. ""The next 1,000 unicorns won't be search engines or social media companies, they'll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonize and create a more sustainable future."" Fink's comments come as the world grapples with the escalating climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, the world will need to invest trillions of dollars in clean energy, energy efficiency, and other climate-friendly technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy sector will need to invest around $5 trillion per year over the next decade to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The shift towards sustainable investing is being driven by a number of factors, including growing awareness of the climate crisis, regulatory changes, and changing consumer preferences. Investors are increasingly realizing that climate change poses a major financial risk. According to the Bank of England, climate change could cause global GDP to decline by up to 10% by 2050. Governments are also introducing new regulations to encourage sustainable investing. In the UK, the government has introduced a new requirement for large pension funds to report on their climate-related risks and opportunities. Consumers are also increasingly demanding products and services from companies that are committed to sustainability. According to a recent survey by Nielsen, 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from sustainable brands. The shift towards sustainable investing is a major challenge, but it is also a major opportunity. By investing in companies that are helping to solve the climate crisis, investors can generate long-term financial returns and help to create a more sustainable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Teenagers risk missing out on savings pots,"By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter These funds were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government of £250, which was doubled for the most disadvantaged families, and additional payments can also be made by parents and family members. Now known as Child Trust Funds (CTFs), they were initially very popular. In its first 12 months of operation almost one million CTFs were opened, and 13 years on around 6.3 million CTFs have been opened across the UK.  However, campaigners say that take-up started to decline following the introduction of a lower contribution rate, set at £50, by the Conservative government in 2011. There are also concerns that parents are not saving into them as much as they could. The average total amount saved in a CTF is just under £1,000 - well below the £1,865 total maximum government contribution. Last year, the Post Office found that 43% of the Child Trust Funds it looks after still only had the original £250 government contribution and there was no additional money added.  A further 22% had less than £500 in total. The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) is concerned that this means rising numbers of young people could be missing out on a substantial financial boost when they reach 18, the age at which they gain access to their CTF. ""The potential long-term loss is significant,"" says CIFF. ""If a typical child was to start saving £6 a week into their CTF, by the time they were 18 they could have accumulated £6,500, assuming a 3% average return. ""Even if they saved just £1 a week they could still end up with £1,300 at 18."" Some banks and building societies have also questioned the future of the CTF, with several stopping offering the product in recent years. Campaigners say the government needs to improve awareness of CTFs, and encourage more families to save into them and a number of banks have urged ministers to simplify the Child Trust Fund system to make it more accessible for poor families. Last year the government announced it was investing £2.5bn in CTFs over the next decade, enabling automatic contributions to increase from £250 to £500 for some children, but CIFF says this is not enough. ""We'd like to see the government ringfence CTFs so that they are not used to pay for other savings products or benefits,"" says CIFF. ""We also want to see the addition of a universal contribution, of say £50 a year, regardless of a family's income or savings history."" The government says it is keeping CTFs under review and will ""continue to make sure that all children, regardless of their background, have the best start in life"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM,"Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM _By Justin Rowlatt_ _Chief environment correspondent_ The prime minister will tell a meeting hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that climate action cannot be allowed to become another victim of the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson, who co-chairs the event with Mr Guterres, will say that ""climate and Covid are two sides of the same coin"", and that they both threaten both our health and prosperity. He will argue that the pandemic has shown that it is possible to take collective action to tackle a global problem, and that the same approach is now needed to tackle the threat of climate change. ""We need to act with the same urgency and ambition that we have brought to the fight against coronavirus,"" he will say. ""Climate change is an even greater threat to humanity than Covid, and it will require an even greater collective effort to overcome it."" The prime minister's speech comes ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is due to be held in Glasgow in November. The conference is seen as a crucial opportunity to accelerate global action on climate change, and to increase the ambition of countries' emissions reduction targets. However, the pandemic has cast doubt over whether the conference will be able to take place as planned, and there are concerns that it could be postponed or even canceled. In his speech, the prime minister will stress the importance of holding the conference as scheduled, and will say that it is ""more important than ever"" to show that the world is committed to tackling climate change. ""COP26 must be a success,"" he will say. ""It is our best chance to put the world on a path to a more sustainable future."" The prime minister's speech will be welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have been calling for the government to show more leadership on climate change. However, they are likely to be disappointed that he did not use his speech to announce any new policies or measures to tackle the climate crisis. The prime minister's speech comes as the UK prepares to host the G7 summit in Cornwall next month. The summit will bring together leaders from the world's seven largest economies, and is expected to focus on a range of issues, including climate change. The prime minister is expected to use the summit to press other countries to increase their ambition on climate change, and to commit to more ambitious emissions reduction targets.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods,"They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed. The Welsh Government said consultation has not yet started, but ""significant change"" could be required to protect marine life. Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods Fishermen in Wales are calling on the Welsh Government to halt plans to restrict the number of pots they can use to catch crabs and lobsters. They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed. The Welsh Government said consultation has not yet started, but ""significant change"" could be required to protect marine life. The proposed changes would see the number of pots a fisherman can use reduced from 200 to 100. Fishermen say this would make it impossible for them to make a living. One fisherman, who asked not to be named, said: ""This is a devastating blow to our industry. We've been fishing these waters for generations and we know what we're doing. ""These restrictions are not based on science. They're just a knee-jerk reaction to what some people wrongly perceive as a problem with crab and lobster stocks."" Another fisherman said: ""We're being treated like criminals. We're not doing anything wrong. We're just trying to make a living."" The Welsh Government said it was committed to working with the fishing industry to find a solution that protects marine life and livelihoods. A spokesperson said: ""We understand the concerns of the fishing industry and we are committed to working with them to find a solution that is fair and sustainable. ""However, we must also take into account the need to protect our marine environment. We believe that significant change is required to achieve this."" The consultation on the proposed changes is expected to start in the autumn. Background The Welsh Government has identified a number of concerns about the sustainability of crab and lobster fishing in Wales. These include: Overfishing: The government believes that the number of crabs and lobsters being caught is not sustainable. Bycatch: The government is concerned about the number of other marine animals, such as dolphins and porpoises, that are being caught in crab and lobster pots. Damage to the marine environment: The government believes that crab and lobster pots can damage the seabed and other marine habitats. The government's proposed changes are designed to address these concerns. The fishing industry has argued that the government's concerns are not supported by the evidence. The industry has also pointed out that crab and lobster fishing is a vital part of the Welsh economy. The industry is worth an estimated £100 million a year and supports around 1,000 jobs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
King Charles III: Outcry 'surprises' Prince William actor Oliver Chris,"BBC Two's King Charles III, which will be shown on Wednesday, imagines events after the death of the Queen. It has ruffled feathers for raising the question of Prince Harry's paternity and showing Princess Anne smoking weed. However, the actor who plays Prince William has said he was surprised by the outcry. Oliver Chris, who has previously starred in shows such as The Crown and Strike, said he was ""taken aback"" by the reaction to the play. ""I thought people would be more interested in the constitutional crisis and the question of who should succeed the Queen,"" he said. Chris said he believes the play is ""a fair and balanced portrayal of the Royal Family."" He said the cast and crew had worked hard to ""represent them accurately and respectfully."" However, some critics have accused the play of being disrespectful and sensationalist. The Daily Mail called it ""a hatchet job on the Royal Family"" and said it was ""full of cruel and unnecessary jibes."" The play has also been criticized for its depiction of Prince Harry. In the play, Harry is portrayed as a troubled young man who is struggling to come to terms with his royal status. He is also shown to be estranged from his family and to have a difficult relationship with his wife, Meghan Markle. Chris said he understands why some people might find the play's portrayal of Harry upsetting. However, he said he believes it is an important and accurate portrayal of a complex character. ""Harry is a young man who is going through a lot of changes in his life,"" Chris said. ""He's trying to find his place in the world and he's struggling to deal with the pressures of being a royal.

Anonymous backs new encrypted social network site,"The site, Minds.com, has the same basic set-up as other social networks. Users post updates to followers, who can comment or share. However, there are a few key differences that set Minds apart. Firstly, Minds is a decentralised platform. This means that it is not controlled by a single entity, such as Facebook or Twitter. Instead, it is run by a network of independent nodes. This makes it much more difficult for governments or corporations to censor or shut down the site. Secondly, Minds is committed to privacy. All user data is encrypted, and the site does not track users' activity. This makes it a much safer place to share sensitive information, such as political opinions or personal data. Finally, Minds is a non-profit organisation. This means that it is not driven by profit, and it can focus on providing a high-quality service to its users. Minds has been praised by privacy advocates and free speech activists. However, it has also been criticised for its lack of moderation. The site has been used by white supremacists and other hate groups to spread their messages. Despite these concerns, Minds is growing in popularity. The site has over 1 million users, and it is adding new users every day. If Minds can continue to grow and improve, it has the potential to become a major player in the social media landscape. In a statement, Anonymous said that it is backing Minds because it believes that the site is ""a step in the right direction for the future of the internet."" ""We need to move away from the centralised, corporate-controlled internet that we have today,"" Anonymous said.

Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June,"The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first £500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July 2020, but was due to revert to £125,000 from April. The government says the move will save home buyers an average of £2,500. The extension will apply retrospectively to anyone who completed the purchase of a property on or after 8 July 2020 and before 1 July 2021. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The stamp duty holiday has helped to keep the property market moving during the pandemic and has supported jobs across the sector. By extending the holiday, we are continuing to help people move, support jobs and stimulate the economy."" The move has been welcomed by the property industry, with the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) saying it would ""provide a further boost to the market"". ""The extension of the stamp duty holiday is a positive step for the property market and will help to maintain momentum,"" said Mark Hayward, chief executive of the NAEA Propertymark. ""It will provide a further boost to the market and help to support jobs in the sector."" However, some experts have warned that the extension could lead to a rise in house prices. ""The stamp duty holiday has been a major factor in the recent surge in house prices,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. ""Extending the holiday will only add further fuel to the fire and could lead to even higher prices."" The government has said it will keep the impact of the stamp duty holiday on house prices under review. The extension of the stamp duty holiday is the latest in a series of measures introduced by the government to support the property market during the pandemic.

Southeastern customers face worsening services,"Tom Edwards Transport correspondent, London @BBCTomEdwards on Twitter If you thought your commute was bad now, it will get worse for the next five years. That's the message hidden in the small print of new plans to overhaul Southeastern. The franchise, which runs trains from London through Kent and East Sussex, was taken over by the government in 2021 amid complaints of poor performance. It's now being run by the Department for Transport (DfT), which has said it will pump in millions of pounds to improve the service. But documents seen by the BBC show that despite this investment, passengers can expect a reduction in services compared with before the pandemic. By summer 2024, Southeastern plans to run 92.5% of pre-pandemic services. That will rise to 95% by summer 2025 and 97.5% by summer 2026. It is not until summer 2027 that the full pre-pandemic service will be restored. And that's on the assumption that all goes to plan. The DfT has warned that these targets could be missed if there are any delays in the delivery of new trains, or if strike action continues to disrupt services. Southeastern has been hit hard by industrial action, with RMT union members striking over pay and working conditions. The union says that Southeastern is among the worst-performing train operators in the country. Southeastern has defended its performance, saying that it is running more trains than at any time since the pandemic began. But it is clear that passengers are not happy. In a recent survey by consumer group Which?, Southeastern was rated the worst train operator in the UK. Passengers complained of overcrowding, delays and cancellations. The DfT says it is ""working closely"" with Southeastern to improve performance. But it is clear that passengers will have to be patient. It could be five years before they see a full restoration of pre-pandemic services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
RHI inquiry: Call for review of special adviser role,"The special adviser to the then-Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell who was tasked with managing the botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme is to be recalled to the inquiry examining the project. David Sterling's witness statements to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) inquiry were published on Wednesday. He is due to give evidence again on Thursday. The inquiry has been told that, in 2015, Mr Sterling asked for a cap to be imposed on the scheme - but was told by Mr Bell to ""do nothing"". The inquiry is investigating the running and collapse of the RHI scheme, which left Stormont with an estimated £490m overspend. It is examining whether there was any cover-up or obstruction of justice. Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin has written to Mr Bell asking him to provide a fuller explanation of his account of a key meeting in March 2015. Sinn Féin's Máirtín Ó Muilleoir described the inquiry's latest findings as ""a bombshell"". ""The evidence suggests that the special adviser, Mr Sterling, raised concerns about how much the RHI scheme was going to cost against the budget and was told to do nothing,"" the North Antrim MLA said. ""It is more proof that this was a scheme that was doomed to fail from the get-go."" In a statement to the inquiry, Mr Sterling said that, during the meeting in March 2015, he had asked Mr Bell whether there should be a cap on the amount of money available to the RHI scheme. He said that Mr Bell had responded: ""I need you to do nothing."" Mr Sterling said that the department's permanent secretary Andrew McCormick had then intervened and told Mr Bell that he should reconsider his position. Mr Sterling said that Mr Bell had then said: ""OK, I will reconsider this over the weekend."" However, in his witness statement to the inquiry, Mr Bell said that he had not understood Mr Sterling to be making a request for a cap. He said that he had thought Mr Sterling was asking for guidance on how to respond to a question from the media about whether there could be a cap. Mr Bell said that he had not told Mr Sterling to do nothing. ""I fully understood the importance of having regard to public expenditure,"" he said. ""I am not so foolish as to just say, 'Do nothing'. ""I would never have said that because I understood the constraints on public expenditure."" Sir Patrick wrote to Mr Bell, saying that his account of the meeting ""lacks any semblance of credibility"". ""Your evidence about not understanding Mr Sterling to be making a request for a cap raises even more serious issues about your honesty and reliability as a witness,"" he wrote. ""You must appreciate that the inquiry expects witnesses to give a full, frank and truthful account of the events in question."" Sir Patrick said that he believed that Mr Sterling's account of the meeting was ""more likely to be the truth"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Video 'shows hunt law breached',"By David Miller BBC Scotland environment correspondent Campaigners claim the ban on hunting with dogs is routinely being flouted. Hunt supporters insist they take great care to respect the law. Footage obtained by the League Against Cruel Sports appears to show foxes being chased and killed by hounds in the Borders, Scotland. The Scottish government said it takes allegations of illegal hunting ""very seriously"" and is ""committed to ensuring compliance"" with the law. The Hunting Act 2004 banned the hunting of wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales, and the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 had a similar effect north of the border, although some exemptions were made for pest control, game bird management and hunting deer. The Scottish government's guidance states that hounds must be under ""close control"" at all times and landowners must make ""all reasonable endeavours to prevent the dogs from pursuing or killing a wild mammal"", while the game bird exemption only applies during the legal season for game birds. However, campaigners from the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) say they have documented examples of hunts flouting these rules in the past year. A spokesman said: ""Our investigations have exposed numerous serious incidents of illegal fox hunting and deer hunting. ""The evidence we have gathered includes foxes being chased and killed by hounds after a hunt saboteur witnessed the dogs being released and also deer being chased down a public road in full view of members of the public."" LACS is calling on the Scottish government to take ""urgent action"" to tackle the problem, including increasing penalties for those caught breaking the law and providing more support for enforcement officers. However, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said it was ""confident that the vast majority of shooting estates in Scotland are operating within the law"". A spokesman said: ""SGA members take their legal responsibilities very seriously and are committed to operating within the letter and spirit of the law. ""We do not condone any form of illegal hunting and we urge anyone with evidence of such activity to report it to the relevant authorities."" The Scottish government said it was ""aware of the concerns raised by the LACS"" and was ""working closely with Police Scotland to investigate any allegations of illegal hunting"". A spokesman said: ""We take allegations of illegal hunting very seriously and are committed to ensuring compliance with the law. ""We are also working with stakeholders to improve understanding of the law and to encourage responsible behavior.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Theresa May 'not considering election' on walking break, says No 10","But - stand down everyone - Number 10 has insisted the prime minister is not considering calling a general election. Mrs May famously decided to call a snap election in 2017, with her Conservative Party losing their majority in the House of Commons. Her spokesman told reporters: ""The prime minister is not considering calling a general election."" The denial comes as the prime minister takes a break in the Swiss Alps with her husband, Philip. The couple are staying in a luxury chalet in the mountain resort of Klosters, where they have been pictured walking in the snow. The prime minister's decision to go on holiday has been criticised by some, who say she should be focusing on Brexit negotiations. But her spokesman said: ""The prime minister is entitled to take a break. She has been working hard over the past few months, and she needs some time to rest and recharge."" It is not clear how long the prime minister will be on holiday for, but she is expected to return to work next week. Her decision to rule out a general election will come as a relief to many Conservative MPs. Many Tory MPs fear that a general election would result in the party losing even more seats, and potentially even handing power to the Labour Party. A general election is not due until 2022, but there has been speculation that the prime minister could call one earlier if she is able to secure a good deal on Brexit. However, with the Brexit negotiations still ongoing, it is not clear when or if such a deal will be reached. Meanwhile, the prime minister's decision to rule out a general election has been welcomed by the Labour Party. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Theresa May's decision not to call a general election shows that she is running scared of the people. ""She knows that if she called an election, she would lose. The people have lost confidence in her and her government."" The Liberal Democrats have also welcomed the prime minister's decision. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Theresa May is right to rule out a general election. The country needs stability, not more chaos. ""We need to focus on getting a good deal on Brexit, and on building a fairer and more prosperous society.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Endangered species: Gunshot detection technology deployed,"By Cristina Criddle, Technology reporter  New technology has been developed by international conservation charity the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Google Cloud. The technology detects gunshots in real time, through machine learning algorithms. It uses audio recordings from smartphones left in the field by rangers, scientists, and community patrollers. When a gunshot is detected, the system immediately sends an alert to the user's phone, enabling a rapid response to poaching incidents. The system was developed using a dataset of over 100,000 gunshot and non-gunshot audio recordings, collected by ZSL and the University of Oxford's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. The system also includes a web interface that allows users to view gunshot detections on a map, manage their devices, and access information on poaching incidents. The technology has been deployed in several countries, including Nepal, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Nepal, the system has been used to detect poaching incidents in Chitwan National Park, home to the world's largest population of one-horned rhinos. In Gabon, the system has been used to monitor poaching in Loango National Park, home to a diverse range of endangered species, including elephants, gorillas, and chimpanzees. The technology is part of ZSL's EDGE of Existence programme, which focuses on protecting threatened and endangered species. Dr. Amy Hinsley, ZSL's EDGE of Existence programme manager, said: ""We are excited about the potential of this technology to help us protect endangered species from poaching. The system can detect gunshots in real time, enabling rangers to respond quickly and effectively to poaching incidents."" Dr. David Maxwell, Google Cloud's director of product management for artificial intelligence, said: ""We are proud to partner with ZSL on this important project. Our machine learning expertise and cloud computing platform have enabled us to develop a system that can detect gunshots in real time, providing rangers with the tools they need to protect endangered species."" The deployment of this technology is a significant step forward in the fight against poaching. It provides rangers and conservationists with a powerful tool to detect and deter poaching incidents, helping to protect the world's most endangered species.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Paris restrictions to stay as France reopens,"Edouard Philippe said the country was ""cut in two"" in terms of the rate of infections. Restrictions will remain in the capital and north-eastern regions. It comes as France prepares to relax its nationwide lockdown on 11 May. Mr Philippe told the French parliament that there remained ""territorial disparities"" in the battle against the virus. ""In some territories, the virus is practically under control and in others it's still circulating very actively,"" he said. He said that restrictions in the Paris region would stay in place for now, along with several other regions including Grand Est, Mayotte, Ile-de-France, and Burgundy-Franche-Comte. However, local authorities will be given more freedom to relax some measures if they wish. From 11 May, the rest of France will be able to start easing restrictions, such as reopening shops that are less than 400 sq m, and allowing people to travel within 100km of their home. Parks are to reopen and people will be allowed to exercise without a time limit, but beaches will remain shut. Bars, restaurants, museums and cinemas will stay closed, but libraries will reopen. People will not be obliged to have special permission to go out, as is currently the case, but they will still need to fill out a form giving a reason for their movements. The prime minister said he understood that Parisians would be disappointed, but he said there was ""no choice"". ""We couldn't take the risk of having a new outbreak of the epidemic after 11 May,"" he said. ""That would be a disaster."" The decision comes after a slow but steady reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases in France. On Saturday, 19 May, there were 104 new deaths, the lowest daily toll since 20 March.

""We've got a strong balance sheet now and a strong capital position, so we're not considering closing it. ""We're also committed to Northern Ireland and committed to supporting our customers and our colleagues in Northern Ireland.""

The bank's financial performance had improved in 2018, with a reported operating profit of £384m, but that still lagged behind most of the group's other operations.

Pakistan Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah targeted by US strike in Afghanistan,"Fazlullah's men shot the schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan in 2012. He was also behind the 2014 massacre in the Pakistani city of Peshawar that killed more than 130 schoolchildren. He became the TTP's leader after his predecessor Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in 2013. Fazlullah was born in 1974 in the Swat Valley in northwestern Pakistan. He received religious training in a madrassa, a religious school, and became known for his fiery speeches against the Pakistani government. He joined the TTP in 2007 and quickly rose through the ranks. Under Fazlullah's leadership, the TTP became increasingly violent. The group carried out a number of suicide bombings and assassinations, and it also imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law in the areas it controlled. Fazlullah was also accused of ordering the beheading of 23 Pakistani soldiers in 2012. In 2014, the Pakistani military launched an operation to clear the TTP from the Swat Valley. The operation was largely successful, and Fazlullah was forced to flee to Afghanistan. He continued to lead the TTP from exile, but his influence has diminished in recent years. Fazlullah was targeted by a US drone strike in Afghanistan on June 13, 2018. The strike killed Fazlullah and several other TTP members. The US government said that Fazlullah was a ""terrorist leader"" and that his death ""will disrupt the TTP's ability to plan and carry out attacks against innocent civilians."" The Pakistani government welcomed the news of Fazlullah's death. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that Fazlullah was ""a brutal terrorist"" who ""had caused immense pain and suffering to the people of Pakistan."" The TTP has not yet named a successor to Fazlullah. The group is likely to face a period of instability following his death, but it is too early to say whether this will lead to a decline in violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New Aberdeen FC stadium could be derailed even if approved,"The stadium and training facilities would be at Kingsford, near Westhill. Although the final decision is a matter for Aberdeen councillors, Aberdeenshire Council will have to agree to a controlled parking zone. The zone would mean drivers would have to pay to park near the stadium on match days, with the money raised going towards transport infrastructure in the area. However, Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee voted against the plans at a meeting on Thursday. They argued that the council should not be responsible for funding transport infrastructure for a private development. The committee's decision does not mean the plans for the new stadium are dead. However, it does mean that Aberdeen FC will have to find another way to fund the transport infrastructure. One option would be for the club to pay for it themselves. However, this would likely be a significant cost. Another option would be for Aberdeen FC to work with the Scottish government or other partners to find funding. However, this could also be a lengthy and difficult process. The decision by Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee is a setback for Aberdeen FC's plans for a new stadium. However, it is not necessarily the end of the road. The club will now have to explore other options for funding the transport infrastructure. If they can find a way to do this, the new stadium could still be built. In a statement, Aberdeen FC said they were ""disappointed"" by the committee's decision. ""We believe that the proposed new stadium would be a major asset for the north-east of Scotland,"" the club said. ""We will now consider our options and continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to try to find a way forward.""

Canada's immigration website crashes during US vote,"Officials have confirmed that the cause was a higher than normal level of traffic. It has been suggested this may have been related to the US vote, as many Americans were reportedly looking into the possibility of emigrating to Canada. The website has since been restored, but the incident has raised questions about Canada's immigration system. Some critics have argued that the system is not equipped to handle the increasing number of people who are looking to come to Canada. In recent years, Canada has seen a significant increase in the number of people who are applying for permanent residency. In 2019, over 340,000 people applied for permanent residency, up from 250,000 in 2015. The increase in applications has been attributed to a number of factors, including the country's strong economy, its high quality of life, and its welcoming immigration policies. However, the influx of applications has also put a strain on the immigration system. The government has taken steps to address the issue, including increasing the number of staff who process applications and investing in new technology. However, the website crash suggests that more needs to be done. Some experts have called for the government to adopt a more streamlined application process. Others have suggested that the government should increase the number of visas that are available to skilled workers. The government has said that it is committed to making the immigration system more efficient and responsive. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the challenges that the system is facing. The website crash is a reminder of the challenges that Canada faces as it tries to manage the increasing number of people who are looking to come to the country.

Grave of 'George III's granddaughter' restored in Carmarthen,"Experts say Caroline Prytherch and her sister were related to the former king due to his links with Hannah Lightfoot during his time as Prince of Wales. The previously lost family grave of Ms Prytherch at St David's Church, Carmarthen, has been restored. Local historian Robert Evans, who has been researching the family history for more than 10 years, said the two sisters were related to King George III through an illegitimate son born to his brother, Prince William Henry. ""Hannah Lightfoot was his mistress, but she was not accepted at court. She was pregnant at the time, and the child was taken away from her,"" Mr Evans explained. The child, William, was brought up by the Prytherch sisters' grandmother in Carmarthen. ""This was considered a left-handed marriage at the time and there is some evidence to suggest that it was accepted,"" he added. The sisters' mother, Lettice Thomas, was a relation of the Prytherch sisters' grandmother, so the link to the royal family goes through both sides. Mr Evans said that the two sisters lived in Carmarthen all their lives and were well-respected members of the community. ""They were known for their kindness and generosity, and they were always willing to help those in need,"" he added. The sisters never married, and they died within a few months of each other in 1872. They were buried in the churchyard at St David's Church. Over time, their grave became overgrown and neglected. However, thanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, it has now been restored. The grave has been cleaned and repaired, and a new headstone has been erected. The headstone bears the sisters' names and dates of death, as well as the inscription: ""Descendants of William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George III"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Solar subsidy 'to be protected',"By Bob Howard Reporter, Money Box The feed-in tariff scheme was launched last April. It promised a typical household earnings of £800 a year for generating electricity from renewable sources such as solar panels, or small wind turbines. But there are fears that the scheme could be scaled back, or even scrapped, as part of the government's spending review. Solar power advocates have condemned the proposal, saying it would damage the UK's nascent solar industry. The Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Chris Huhne, has said that no decisions have been made, but he has admitted that the feed-in tariff scheme is ""expensive"". The government has already announced that it will cut spending on other renewable energy schemes, such as the Renewables Obligation. This has led to fears that the government is not committed to supporting renewable energy. However, the government has said that it remains committed to meeting its targets for renewable energy. The UK has a target of generating 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. The feed-in tariff scheme is one of the key policies that the government is using to meet this target. The scheme has been successful in encouraging people to install solar panels. In the first year of the scheme, over 100,000 solar panels were installed. This is more than double the number that were installed in the previous year. However, the solar industry is still in its early stages. The cost of solar panels has fallen in recent years, but they are still more expensive than traditional forms of electricity generation. The feed-in tariff scheme helps to make solar power more affordable. But if the scheme is scaled back, or scrapped, it could make it more difficult for the solar industry to grow. The government is due to announce its decision on the future of the feed-in tariff scheme in the autumn.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Another, surnamed Wang, queried: ""Is this question relevant to the syllabus?"" Other users said they felt sorry for the children who were left flummoxed by the question. One user said: ""This is just to torture the kids."" Another added: ""The person who came up with this question needs to go back to school."" The question has since been removed from the paper and an investigation has been launched into how it came to be included in the first place. In a statement, the Shunqing District Education Bureau said: ""We have taken this matter very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation. We will take appropriate action once the investigation is complete."" The incident has sparked a debate about the quality of education in China. Some parents have called for stricter controls on the content of exams, while others have said that schools need to focus more on developing students' critical thinking skills. One expert, Professor Zhang Minxuan of Beijing Normal University, said: ""This question is a typical example of the kind of rote learning that is still prevalent in Chinese schools. Students are expected to memorize facts and figures, rather than to think for themselves."" He added: ""We need to move away from this kind of teaching and learning and focus more on developing students' critical thinking skills. This means teaching them how to analyse information, solve problems, and make decisions."" The Shunqing District Education Bureau has said that it will take steps to improve the quality of education in the district. It has also said that it will provide more support to teachers and parents. The incident has also prompted calls for a national review of exam content. One member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a top advisory body, has called for a ""thorough review"" of all school exams. He said: ""We need to make sure that exams are testing students' knowledge and skills, not just their ability to memorize facts."" The debate about the quality of education in China is likely to continue. However, the Shunqing District Education Bureau has said that it is committed to improving the quality of education in the district and is taking steps to address the concerns of parents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"New markets for Welsh firms after Brexit, says PM","The Conservative leader said she wanted the ""best possible deal"" for Wales and the whole of the UK. Meanwhile, Mrs May confirmed that she had written to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, formally beginning the process of exiting the EU. ""The Government will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people and will bring certainty and clarity to the UK's future outside the EU,"" she said. ""We want to build an economy that works for everyone, where young people have the chance to succeed and where public services can be protected."" The UK will now enter a two-year period of negotiations with the EU, during which time it will need to secure a deal on the terms of its exit, including trade, immigration and security. The government has said that it wants to achieve a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU, but it is unclear what this will entail. Businesses and organisations in Wales have welcomed the prospect of new markets outside the EU, but have also expressed concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy. The Welsh government has said that it will work to ensure that Wales benefits from the opportunities that Brexit presents. ""We will work with the UK government to secure the best possible deal for Wales,"" said First Minister Carwyn Jones. ""We will also work to ensure that Wales is well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit presents."" The UK's decision to leave the EU has been met with mixed reactions in Wales. Some people believe that it will be a positive move that will allow the UK to regain control of its borders and laws. Others are concerned about the potential economic impact of Brexit and the loss of access to the single market. The UK government has said that it will work to ensure that the UK leaves the EU in a orderly and stable manner. It has also said that it will work to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The UK's exit from the EU is a complex and challenging process. It is unclear what the final outcome will be, but it is likely to have a significant impact on Wales and the rest of the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
South Africa parliament chaos as Malema MPs heckle Zuma,"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, repeatedly interrupted Mr Zuma, demanding answers over a spending scandal. The speaker of parliament, Baleka Mbete, repeatedly warned the EFF MPs but they continued to heckle the president. At one point, Mr Zuma was forced to stop speaking as the EFF MPs chanted ""Zuma must go!"" and ""Pay back the money!"" Some of the EFF MPs even held up signs that read ""Zuma thief"" and ""Zuma must fall."" The chaos in parliament continued for several minutes before the speaker was forced to adjourn the session. The EFF MPs then marched out of the chamber, chanting slogans and waving their fists. The spending scandal that the EFF MPs were referring to relates to the use of taxpayers' money to upgrade Mr Zuma's private home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal. The Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, found that Mr Zuma had benefited unduly from the upgrades, which cost the state more than 200 million rand ($15 million). Mr Zuma has denied any wrongdoing, but the scandal has damaged his reputation and led to calls for his resignation. The EFF has been one of the most vocal critics of Mr Zuma and has repeatedly called for him to step down. The chaos in parliament is the latest in a series of incidents that have highlighted the growing tensions between the ANC and the EFF. The EFF is a relatively new party, but it has quickly become one of the most popular opposition parties in South Africa. The EFF is known for its radical policies and its confrontational style of politics. The ANC has accused the EFF of being disruptive and disrespectful, but the EFF has defended its tactics, saying that they are necessary to hold the government to account. The chaos in parliament is likely to further strain relations between the two parties. It is unclear what the long-term consequences of the chaos in parliament will be. However, it is clear that the incident has damaged the reputation of both the ANC and the EFF. It is also clear that the tensions between the two parties are likely to continue to grow in the coming months and years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stolen dogs: Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry raids 'uncover 80',"The dogs and puppies are said to be worth tens of thousands of pounds, Dyfed-Powys and South Wales (SWP) police forces said. Pet owners have been warned to be vigilant after two raids in Wales uncovered 80 stolen dogs and puppies. The animals were taken from Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry, near Neath. Officers said they were alerted to the thefts by a concerned member of the public who reported seeing suspicious activity. A team of officers was assembled and raided two addresses, one in Carmarthenshire and the other in Briton Ferry. Inside, they discovered 80 dogs and puppies of various breeds, including French bulldogs, pugs, and German shepherds. The animals were found crammed into small cages and pens, and many were in poor health. Some of the dogs had been microchipped, but many had not. Police said the dogs were stolen to order and were believed to be worth tens of thousands of pounds. ""These animals are often sold for large sums of money, and the trade in stolen dogs is a lucrative one,"" said a spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys Police. ""We are urging pet owners to be vigilant and to take steps to ensure their animals are safe."" Police are asking anyone who has had a dog stolen to contact them. They are also appealing for information about anyone who may have been involved in the thefts. ""We are determined to bring those responsible to justice and to return these animals to their rightful owners,"" the spokesperson said. The raids are part of an ongoing investigation into the theft of dogs in Wales. In recent months, there have been a number of reports of dogs being stolen from homes and gardens. Police believe the thefts are being carried out by organized gangs who are targeting specific breeds of dogs. Pet owners are advised to take the following steps to protect their dogs from being stolen: - Keep your dog on a lead when in public places. - Don't leave your dog unattended in a car or in the garden. - Ensure your dog is microchipped and that the details are up to date. - Report any suspicious activity to the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Government automatically enrols firms in case of no-deal Brexit,"The move will enable UK firms to continue to trade with EU member states after the UK leaves the EU. The government has said it will automatically enrol firms in the scheme if they do not do so themselves. The announcement was made by Brexit Secretary David Davis, who said it was ""essential"" that businesses were prepared for a no-deal Brexit. ""We want to do everything we can to support businesses and ensure that they have the tools and information they need to continue trading with the EU,"" he said. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave."" The scheme will be open to all UK businesses, regardless of size or sector. Businesses will need to provide some basic information about their business, such as their name, address and contact details. They will also need to declare whether they export to the EU or import from the EU. Businesses that are already registered for the scheme will not need to do anything further. The government has said it will provide further details about the scheme in due course. The announcement has been welcomed by businesses. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was ""essential"" that businesses were given support to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave,"" said BCC Director General Adam Marshall. ""We urge all businesses to take advantage of this scheme and to start preparing for a no-deal Brexit."" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) also welcomed the announcement. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave,"" said CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn. ""We urge all businesses to take advantage of this scheme and to start preparing for a no-deal Brexit.""

Mosul Iraq battle: IS accused of shooting civilians,"The UN says 12 civilians were shot dead on 11 November when they tried to stop militants launching rockets from the roofs of the homes in the Bakir area. Militants allegedly killed 27 others suspected of collaborating with Iraqi forces. The latest allegations of atrocities add to the mounting evidence of the brutality of IS's three-year reign over Mosul. The group's crimes have included mass executions, public torture and rape. Human Rights Watch has accused it of committing ""war crimes, crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide"" in Iraq. Mosul's civilian population has borne the brunt of the fighting. The UN estimates that at least 1,000 civilians have been killed and 10,000 injured since the offensive began in October. The Iraqi government and its US-led coalition partners have been accused of causing civilian casualties with airstrikes and shelling. However, IS has also been blamed for using civilians as human shields and booby-trapping buildings. The humanitarian situation in Mosul is dire. The city's water and electricity supplies are limited and food is scarce. Thousands of people have been displaced from their homes. The UN's humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Lise Grande, has called for safe passage for civilians who want to leave Mosul. She said the UN and its partners were ""ready to scale up our response and provide life-saving assistance to all those in need"". The Iraqi government has said it is committed to minimizing civilian casualties in Mosul. However, it has also vowed to defeat IS at all costs. This suggests that the battle for Mosul could continue for some time, and that the civilian population will continue to suffer. The liberation of Mosul would be a major victory for the Iraqi government and its US-led coalition partners. However, it would also be a Pyrrhic victory if it came at the cost of thousands of civilian lives. The international community must do everything it can to ensure that the civilians of Mosul are protected. The UN must continue to provide humanitarian assistance, and the Iraqi government and its coalition partners must do everything they can to minimize civilian casualties.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Male employees want flexible work too,"By Mary-Ann Russon Business Reporter, BBC News In the past, pressure for the opportunity to work part-time or flexibly has usually come from women. But increasingly, men also want to strike a better work-life balance. For years, the UK government and many individual employers have been encouraging more women into the workplace. Policies such as shared parental leave and flexible working were designed to make it easier for women to return to their jobs after having children. However, as flexible working becomes increasingly common, men are beginning to take advantage of these opportunities too. A recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the number of men working flexibly in the UK has increased by 50% in the past decade. The study also found that flexible working is associated with a range of positive outcomes for both men and women, including: Increased job satisfaction Improved work-life balance Reduced stress levels Increased productivity There are a number of reasons why men are increasingly interested in flexible working. One reason is that men are increasingly taking on more childcare responsibilities. In the past, childcare was often seen as a woman's responsibility, but that is changing. Nowadays, many men are happy to share the childcare with their partners. Another reason why men are interested in flexible working is that they want to spend more time with their families. In the past, men were often expected to work long hours and put their careers first. However, that is no longer the case. Many men now want to have a more balanced life, where they can spend time with their families as well as their work. The rise of flexible working is good news for both men and women. It allows people to work in a way that suits them, and it can help to create a more balanced and fulfilling life. However, there are still some challenges to overcome. One challenge is that flexible working is not always seen as acceptable for men. Some people still believe that men should be the main breadwinners and that they should not be taking time off work to care for their families. Another challenge is that flexible working can be difficult to implement in some workplaces. For example, it can be difficult to arrange flexible working for employees who work in customer-facing roles. Despite these challenges, the trend towards flexible working is likely to continue. As more and more people realize the benefits of flexible working, it will become increasingly accepted and implemented in workplaces.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

£5.6m Newbridge Memo makeover gets under way,"Scaffolding is set to go up at the Grade II listed Newbridge Memorial Hall, known as the Memo, in Caerphilly county. It follows an eight-year fundraising campaign by the hall's trustees. Built in 1923 to commemorate the fallen of the First World War, the Memo has fallen into disrepair in recent years. The £5.6m restoration project will not only ensure the building's future but also revitalise the surrounding area. The makeover includes a new glazed atrium entrance, a lift to provide disabled access, modern toilet facilities, and a new bar and kitchen. A new extension will also be built to house a new community centre, classrooms, meeting rooms, and an office space. The project is being funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Caerphilly County Borough Council, the Welsh government, and the Garfield Weston Foundation. Work is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Once complete, the Memo will once again be a thriving community hub, offering a wide range of activities and events for local people. It will also provide a much-needed space for community groups, businesses, and individuals to meet, socialise, and learn. The Memo's trustees are delighted to see work finally getting under way. ""This is a momentous day for the Memo,"" said chairman John Edmunds. ""We have been working towards this for many years, and we are so grateful to everyone who has supported us. ""The Memo is a vital part of our community, and we are excited to see it restored to its former glory."" The Memo's restoration is part of a wider regeneration project for Newbridge. The village has been awarded £1.5m from the Welsh government's Town Centre Regeneration Fund. The money will be used to improve the village's public realm, including new pavements, streetlighting, and seating. A new community garden will also be created.

Coronavirus funeral restrictions: 'Other families shouldn't have to go through this',"Iolo Cheung BBC News Only 12 people were allowed to attend Bernard Lawrence's funeral last week. His granddaughter Ffion Evans said it was frustrating as many other Covid measures have been eased. The Welsh Government has said it appreciated how difficult it was for people to say goodbye to their loved ones with the current restrictions. But it said the limit on funeral numbers was still necessary to help prevent the spread of the virus. ""We know that this is a difficult time for people who are grieving the loss of a loved one, and we want to offer our deepest sympathies,"" a Welsh Government spokesperson said. ""We are keeping the situation under review and will make changes to the regulations as soon as it is safe to do so."" Ffion Evans said her grandfather, who died aged 87, was a ""kind and loving man"" who will be greatly missed by his family and friends. She said the family had to make the difficult decision to limit the number of people who could attend his funeral due to the current restrictions. ""It was really frustrating because so many other things have been lifted now,"" she said. ""I understand that they're trying to keep people safe, but it was still hard to have to tell people they couldn't come."" Ffion said the family were able to live-stream the funeral so that other people could watch it online. ""It was nice to be able to share it with other people who couldn't be there,"" she said. ""But it's not the same as being able to hug them and to be together in person."" The Welsh Government has said it is working with faith groups and funeral directors to develop guidance on how to hold funerals safely during the pandemic. It said it would continue to keep the situation under review and would make changes to the regulations as soon as it was safe to do so.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fallen Yosemite climbers were 'very experienced',"Jason Wells, 46, and Tim Klein, 42, had climbed together for decades, including in the California park. Officials are investigating how they both fell over 1,000ft (300m) from the granite rock. The climbers were about 2,000ft up El Capitan - almost two thirds of the way to the summit - when they fell. They had been preparing to abseil back down. Yosemite National Park spokeswoman Jamie Richards said the pair were ""very experienced climbers"" who knew the route well. They fell just after 11:00 local time on Saturday (18:00 GMT) while on the Salathé Wall route. Witnesses saw two bodies on the ground at the base of the cliff. Search and rescue teams recovered the bodies but officials have not yet said how the climbers fell. Park spokeswoman Jamie Richards said the pair reached the summit of El Capitan on Friday, and were preparing to rappel down when they fell. ""They were descending from the top of El Capitan when something happened and caused both climbers to fall,"" she said. ""Our hearts go out to their families and loved ones."" The park service is investigating the accident and said it will release more information when it is available. El Capitan is one of the most popular climbing destinations in the world, and is known for its sheer granite walls. The Salathé Wall route is considered one of the most challenging on El Capitan, and requires climbers to ascend over 3,000ft of rock. In May, three climbers were killed in an avalanche on the mountain. Yosemite National Park is home to some of the world's most famous rock climbing routes, and attracts climbers from all over the world. However, the park also has a history of climbing accidents. In 2017, a British climber fell to his death while attempting to free-climb El Capitan. Despite the risks, climbers continue to flock to Yosemite to challenge themselves on its iconic rock formations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tinder to introduce in-app background checks,"By Cody Godwin BBC News, San Francisco Later this year, Tinder will allow users to view public records information of perspective dates using their name or mobile number. The feature, called ""Background Check,"" will be powered by Garbo, a non-profit organization that searches public records for potentially harmful information. Tinder says it will be the first social media company to offer such a service. The announcement comes as Tinder faces increasing scrutiny over its safety record. In recent years, the app has been linked to several high-profile cases of violence and abuse. In 2019, a woman was murdered by a man she met on Tinder. Tinder has since implemented several safety features, including a ""panic button"" that allows users to call for help if they feel unsafe. However, the company has been criticized for not doing enough to protect its users. The new background check feature is designed to address these concerns. It will allow users to see if a potential date has any criminal convictions, restraining orders, or other public records that could indicate a risk of harm. Tinder says that users will have the option to opt out of the background check feature. However, the company hopes that most users will choose to use it, as it could help to make the app safer. ""We believe that this new feature will help to make Tinder a safer place for our users,"" said Tinder CEO Elie Seidman. ""We want to give our users the tools they need to make informed decisions about who they're matching with."" The background check feature is still in development and is expected to launch later this year. Here are some additional details about the feature: The background check will be powered by Garbo, a non-profit organization that searches public records for potentially harmful information. Users will have the option to opt out of the background check feature. The background check will be free to use. The background check will only include information that is available in public records. The background check will not include any information that is protected by law, such as medical records or financial information.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday. They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal. The guidance is based on expert advice from Public Health England and has been developed in consultation with members of the British Film Commission and Pact, the UK's trade association for the creative industries. It includes measures to ensure that filming can take place safely in a variety of locations, including studios, outside broadcasts and on location. Key measures include: Social distancing: All cast and crew members must maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from each other at all times. This may mean using green screens or other techniques to create the illusion of close proximity. Hygiene: All cast and crew members must wash their hands regularly and wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate. The use of hand sanitiser will be mandatory on set. Testing: Cast and crew members may be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. This will help to identify and isolate any individuals who may be infected with the virus. The guidance also includes specific measures for different types of filming, such as: Studio filming: Studio filming will be limited to a maximum of 50 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Outside broadcasts: Outside broadcasts will be limited to a maximum of 25 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Location filming: Location filming will be limited to a maximum of 10 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.

MoT changes come into force in Northern Ireland,"Under the new rules, more than 20 extra checks will be carried out on vehicles. The checks relate mostly to safety-critical items, such as tyres, brakes, lights, steering and suspension. The changes have been brought in to improve road safety and reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions. The new rules mean that drivers of all vehicles, including cars, vans, motorbikes and buses, will need to have their vehicles tested more frequently. Cars and small vans will need to be tested every two years, instead of every three years. Larger vehicles, such as buses and lorries, will need to be tested every year. The new rules also mean that the tests will be more comprehensive. More than 20 extra checks will be carried out on each vehicle, including: Checking the tread depth of tyres Checking the condition of brakes Checking the condition of lights Checking the condition of steering and suspension Checking for any leaks or damage to the vehicle The changes have been welcomed by road safety campaigners, who say they will help to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions. However, some garage owners have expressed concern about the increased workload that the new rules will create. They say that they may have to increase their prices to cover the cost of the extra tests. The Department for Infrastructure has said that it will be working with the garage industry to ensure that the new rules are implemented smoothly. It is important to note that the new rules only apply to vehicles that are registered in Northern Ireland. Vehicles that are registered in other parts of the UK will not need to be tested more frequently. If you are unsure whether your vehicle needs to be tested, you can check the MOT checker on the Department for Infrastructure website. The new MOT rules are just one of a number of measures that the Department for Infrastructure is taking to improve road safety in Northern Ireland. Other measures include: Investing in new road safety infrastructure, such as road signs and traffic lights Educating drivers about the dangers of speeding, drink-driving and other risky behaviours Enforcing the law against dangerous drivers The Department for Infrastructure is committed to making Northern Ireland's roads safer for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The couple exchanged rings and vows in front of their family and friends, including celebrities such as Roger Moore and Naomi Campbell. After the ceremony, the couple rode in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Monaco, waving to the cheering crowds. They then attended a reception at the Opera House, where they danced and mingled with their guests. The wedding was a major event in Monaco and drew worldwide attention. It was seen as a symbol of the country's continued status as a glamorous and exclusive destination. However, the wedding was also overshadowed by controversy. In the days leading up to the ceremony, there were rumors that the bride had tried to leave the country and that she was only marrying Prince Albert because of his wealth and status. These rumors were denied by the palace, but they cast a shadow over the wedding and raised questions about the couple's future. Despite the controversy, the wedding was a success and was celebrated by the people of Monaco. It was a reminder of the country's rich history and its continued appeal as a destination for the rich and famous.

BCP Council leader Vikki Slade ousted in second confidence vote loss,"Lib Dem Vikki Slade failed to win support over a Tory motion stating ""a high level of public frustration and mistrust"" in her administration. She had led Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council since May 2019, under the Unity Alliance. A coalition of Labour, Independent and Green councillors voted with the Conservatives, leaving the Lib Dems and two Independent councillors supporting Vikki Slade. The motion was triggered by a string of public rows that have made national headlines, including an investigation into the deputy leader Cllr Philip Broadhead who was accused of sexual harassment. Cllr Slade was also criticized over a council tax increase, and the collapse of a suspended pier project, which the leader had strongly supported. The vote was the second time the Conservative group had put forward a motion of no confidence in Vikki Slade. In January, only the Conservative councillors supported the motion, with Labour, Green and Independent councillors abstaining, and Lib Dems voting against it. In a statement Vikki Slade said: ""I am disappointed with the outcome of tonight's vote and believe that it is a huge loss for local democracy. ""I am deeply saddened that councillors have chosen to put party politics before the best interests of the residents of BCP. ""Throughout my time as leader I have always put the needs of residents first and worked tirelessly to deliver the best possible services in an extremely challenging financial environment."" The council said it would now begin the process of electing a new leader. The Unity Alliance was formed by the Lib Dems, the Conservatives, and two Independent councillors, in May 2019. The agreement was intended to give the Lib Dems control of the council, while giving the Conservatives a greater influence than they would have had in opposition. However, the coalition has been dogged by rows, with the Conservatives and Lib Dems clashing over a number of issues. The Tories had already withdrawn from the alliance in 2022, leaving the Lib Dems in a minority administration. A full council meeting will be held on 15 March to determine a new leader of the council.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Mr Holloway said: ""I believe an airport on the Isle of Grain could bring many benefits to north Kent, but it is important that the local community is consulted and their views are taken into account."" The MPs' meeting with Moylan came after a leaked letter revealed that the aviation industry lobby group had offered to provide them with ""research and other materials"" to help them make their case for an airport. The letter, from Moylan to Tory MP Mark Francois, said: ""We would be delighted to provide you with any research and other materials you may need to help you make your case."" The offer was made after Francois had written to Moylan asking for help in persuading the government to support an airport on the Isle of Grain. The Department for Transport said it was ""not considering"" an airport on the Isle of Grain. An airport on the Isle of Grain has been proposed for decades, but it has always been met with strong local opposition. A public inquiry into the proposal in 2003 concluded that an airport would have a ""significant adverse impact"" on the environment and local communities. The Isle of Grain is a peninsula on the south bank of the River Thames, between the towns of Gravesend and Sheerness. It is home to a number of oil refineries and other industrial facilities. An airport on the Isle of Grain would be close to the proposed site of the Lower Thames Crossing, a new bridge and tunnel that would link Kent with Essex. The government has said it is committed to building the Lower Thames Crossing, but it has not yet confirmed when the project will be completed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Unilever: Ice cream in, personal hygiene out in lockdown","The firm said ice cream sales leapt 26% in the three months to June, but demand for shampoo and deodorant fell. It said it had seen strong ""growth in home consumption of foods, ice cream and tea"" during lockdown. But hair salons and barbers being closed meant customers bought less shampoo, hair conditioner and hair spray. And with people spending more time at home, it said, they were using less deodorant. Unilever's sales overall fell by 1.6% between April and June, as sales of its beauty and personal care products dropped by 7.2%. However, sales of its food and refreshments products rose by 4.6%. The Anglo-Dutch company, which also owns brands including Dove soap, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Marmite spread, said it had seen ""encouraging"" signs of recovery in China, where the coronavirus pandemic began.  But it said the outlook in other markets was ""highly uncertain"" due to the potential for further lockdowns. ""Covid-19 continues to have a significant impact on people's lives and livelihoods, and this is reflected in our first half results,"" said chief executive Alan Jope.  ""In response, we have accelerated our plans to simplify our business by making portfolio choices that enhance our focus on fewer, bigger brands and markets where we can deliver superior returns. We are also continuing to invest in our long-term growth priorities, such as digitalisation, e-commerce and sustainability."" Unilever, which has its headquarters in London and Rotterdam, said it had raised its prices in order to offset a 4% rise in the cost of its raw materials. The company, the world's second largest consumer goods maker, has been reviewing its business in recent months. In March it announced plans to sell off its tea business, which includes the PG Tips and Lipton brands, in order to focus on faster growing areas.

Nick Grimshaw's Radio 1 debut impresses critics,"The Telegraph's Michael Hogan was impressed by Grimshaw's ""youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music"". The Guardian's Elisabeth Mahoney said Grimshaw made a confident debut. It was ""a very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to shove off and go and die"". The Independent's Andy Gill was less enthusiastic, describing the show as ""a bit of a curate's egg"" and saying that Grimshaw's ""flippancy and over-familiarity"" were off-putting. However, he did praise Grimshaw's ""decent taste in music"". Overall, the critics were divided in their opinions of Grimshaw's debut. However, the general consensus was that he had made a promising start and that he had the potential to be a successful radio presenter.

Grimshaw's show became one of the most popular on the station, and he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces in British broadcasting. Grimshaw's success on Radio 1 was not without its critics. Some accused him of being too ""mainstream"" and of not playing enough alternative music. However, Grimshaw remained unfazed by these criticisms. He continued to play the music that he loved and to connect with his audience in his own unique way. In 2018, Grimshaw announced that he would be leaving Radio 1 after six years. He said that he wanted to ""try something different"" and that he was ""excited for the future"". Grimshaw's departure from Radio 1 was met with sadness by many of his fans. However, they wished him well in his future endeavors. Grimshaw's legacy at Radio 1 is one of success and innovation.

Lancashire County Council election: Tories gain control,"The authority had been under no overall control, with Labour the biggest party by four councillors. Nationally, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) suffered huge losses, but they did manage to gain the Padiham and Burnley West ward on. UKIP's gain was Labour's loss, with sitting Labour councillor Christine Fogarty losing her seat to UKIP's Paul Parker by 67 votes. Mr Parker was joined by UKIP's Alan Hosker, who saw off competition from four other candidates with 60% of the vote. Elsewhere in Burnley, the three sitting Conservative councillors in the Daneshouse with Stoneyholme ward all retained their seats. In Pendle, victory for the Conservatives in the Vivary Bridge ward means Labour have lost control of the council. The Tories gained the seat from Labour by the narrowest of margins - just four votes - after recounts. Nigel Eden, Paul McKenna and Graham Roach took the seats for the Conservatives. It's the first time the Conservatives have taken overall control of Pendle since it was created out of the local government reorganisation in 1974. For Labour, it's the first time since 1987 that they have not controlled the council. In Hyndburn, Labour maintained control despite losing Rishton ward to the Conservatives. However, Labour's losses did mean the party's majority was reduced from 16 to eight. In Rossendale, Labour managed to gain a seat from the Conservatives in the Eden ward, meaning they retained control of the council with 21 councillors. Liberal Democrats held onto all three of their seats in the Lancaster City Council elections. In Wyre, the Conservatives gained two seats from Labour and one from the Liberal Democrats. The Tories now control the council with 18 councillors to Labour's 12. Overall, the results were a mixed bag for the Conservatives, who made gains in some areas but lost ground in others. However, the party's victory in Pendle will be seen as a major achievement, and it will be interesting to see how they use their new-found power.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

UK plans £3m no-deal medicine transport,"UK plans £3m no-deal medicine transport By Howard Mustoe & Joe Miller Business reporter It wants to hire an ""express freight service"" to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue. But experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the contract is ""unachievable"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the new service would help ensure ""critical medicines"" would be available in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, but it is not yet clear what will happen to trade between the two sides after that date. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it could lead to delays at the border, which could affect the supply of medicines. The DHSC said the new express freight service would be used to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue from suppliers in the EU to the UK. The service would be used in addition to the existing arrangements for transporting medicines, which include air and sea freight. The DHSC said it was ""working closely with the pharmaceutical industry and hauliers to ensure that we have the capacity and capability to deliver medicines to patients in all circumstances."" However, experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the contract is ""unachievable"". John Kearney, the chief executive of the British International Freight Association, said it would be ""impossible"" to get a new express freight service up and running by 1 September. He said: ""The logistics industry is already stretched to capacity, and there is no spare capacity available to set up a new service by that date."" The DHSC said it was ""confident"" that it would be able to award the contract by 1 September.

Russia halts Lithuania dairy imports in trade row,"Russia has halted all imports of Lithuanian dairy produce in a widening trade row between the two countries. Russia's consumer watchdog said the levels of yeast and mould in Lithuanian dairy produce were unacceptable. Lithuania is already involved in a bitter dispute with Russia over the cost of gas imports from Russia's Gazprom energy giant. The Russian consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said its inspections of Lithuanian dairy products found ""unacceptable levels of yeast and mould"". The watchdog said it had banned imports of all Lithuanian dairy products with immediate effect. Lithuanian officials have rejected the allegations, saying that their dairy products meet all EU safety standards. The Lithuanian government has accused Russia of using the dairy ban as a political tool to pressure Lithuania into accepting higher gas prices. The dairy ban is the latest in a series of trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania. In recent months, Russia has also banned imports of Lithuanian fruit, vegetables, and meat. The trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania are part of a wider pattern of tensions between Russia and the European Union. Russia has been accused of using trade bans and other economic measures to pressure EU countries into supporting its policies. The EU has condemned the Russian trade bans, saying they are illegal and unjustified. The EU has also imposed its own sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania are likely to continue in the coming months. Russia has said that it will not lift the dairy ban until Lithuania agrees to accept higher gas prices. Lithuania has said that it will not accept higher gas prices and that it will continue to challenge the Russian trade bans in the courts.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

British Steel in talks with government to avert collapse,"Sources close to owners Greybull Capital say its future will be discussed at ""ministerial level"". British Steel has admitted it needs further financial support from the government to help it address high energy costs and a downturn in its markets. It employs 3,400 people in the UK, mostly in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire and Teesside, after it was bought out of liquidation in 2016. The government has declined to comment on the prospect of a bailout. The firm is one of the UK's largest steelmakers. It is reportedly losing about £1m a day and will run out of cash by the end of the month unless it can agree on a support package from the government. Government support would be likely to be in the form of loans rather than equity. The steel industry has been hit hard by a combination of factors including: The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, which have led to a surge in gas prices and uncertainty about supply. Falling demand from construction and manufacturing as a result of the economic downturn. Increased competition from China, which has led to a global glut of steel. The UK government has already provided the company with a £30m loan and a £100m guarantee on commercial loans. It is understood that the company is asking for a further £300m to help it through the current crisis. The government is thought to be reluctant to provide further support without guarantees that the company has a long-term future, and that taxpayers' money will be protected. The company is currently carrying out a strategic review of its operations, and it is understood that it is considering selling off some of its assets. Any deal to sell the company would likely need the approval of the government, which has a ""golden share"" in the company that gives it the right to veto any sale. The government has said that it is committed to supporting the steel industry, but it is also mindful of the need to protect taxpayers' money.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""I think the UK has certainly strengths and it has weaknesses also, and I think it's important to recognise that the position in which the UK economy is today is not as strong as it could have been,"" she said. ""Having said that, it has some strengths that should enable it to go through with the process in a satisfactory manner, but there will be pain and there will be a slowdown and there will be some adjustments that the UK economy will have to go through."" Her comments come as the UK government prepares to start the process of negotiating its exit from the European Union. The government has said that it wants to leave the single market and the customs union, and to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. However, there is uncertainty about what kind of deal the UK will be able to negotiate, and how long the process will take. Ms Lagarde said that the UK economy was not as well prepared for Brexit as it could have been, and that there would be some pain ahead.

""I think it's important for the UK government to be as transparent as possible about the potential impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and to be honest with the British people about what the challenges will be,"" she said. The UK government has said that it is committed to transparency, and that it will provide regular updates on the progress of the Brexit negotiations.

US 'may free Israel spy Jonathan Pollard',"A US official told the New York Times that no decisions had been made, but confirmed there had been discussions. Pollard, who was granted Israeli citizenship in 1995, is serving a life sentence for passing thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents to Israel in the 1980s. He was arrested in 1985 and has been in prison ever since. In 2015, the Obama administration commuted Pollard's sentence by five years, making him eligible for parole in November 2018. However, the Trump administration has not yet made a decision on whether to release him. Pollard's case has been the subject of much debate over the years. Some argue that he is a traitor who deserves to remain in prison, while others believe that he has already served his time and should be released. Pollard's supporters, including many members of the Israeli government, have argued that he was treated unfairly and should be released on humanitarian grounds. They point out that he has already served 30 years in prison, which is more than any other American convicted of spying for an ally. Pollard's opponents, including some former US intelligence officials, argue that he is a danger to national security and should never be released. They say that he betrayed his country by providing Israel with highly classified information that could have been used to harm the United States. The decision of whether or not to release Pollard is ultimately up to President Trump. He has not yet indicated what he will do, but he has said that he is aware of the case and is considering all of his options. If Trump decides to release Pollard, it would be a significant diplomatic gesture to Israel. It would also be a controversial decision, as Pollard is a convicted spy who has caused significant damage to the United States. The decision of whether or not to release Pollard is a complex one with no easy answers. It is a decision that will have a significant impact on US-Israeli relations, as well as on Pollard's own life.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors,"Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors By Zoe Kleinman Reporter, BBC News Nadine Dorries was giving a statement in Parliament, on the Cumberlege review, published on Wednesday. The review, which had heard from about 700 women, focused on vaginal mesh to treat incontinence, a problem that mainly affects middle-aged and older women. Vaginal mesh is a synthetic material that is used to treat incontinence and prolapse - in which organs slip down because supporting tissues have weakened. It has been used in more than 100,000 operations in the UK. But the review found that many women had been given mesh implants without fully understanding the risks. Some said they had been pressured into having it and not told about alternatives. Many also complained that their concerns about pain and complications after surgery were ignored by doctors. ""I want to acknowledge today that on too many occasions the experiences of these women were missed, ignored, or dismissed,"" Ms Dorries said. ""I want to say sorry to each and every one of them."" She said the government would now set up a new body to implement the review's recommendations, including a compensation scheme for those who had suffered complications from mesh implants. The review also looked at other types of surgery for incontinence and prolapse. It found that up to a quarter of women who have these operations experience serious complications. The government has promised to invest £50m in research into new treatments for incontinence and prolapse. The Cumberlege review was commissioned by the government in 2020. It was led by Baroness Cumberlege, a crossbench peer who has previously chaired inquiries into other medical scandals. In her report, Baroness Cumberlege said that the mesh scandal was ""the result of a collective failure of the system"". She said that women had been ""failed by the healthcare system, by manufacturers, and by regulators"". She called for a change in the way that mesh is used in the NHS. She said that it should only be used as a last resort, after other treatments have failed. The government has said that it will accept all of the review's recommendations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cladding: MPs fail in bid to change fire safety payment rules,"The Fire Safety Bill - to strengthen regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire - comes after financial help was granted to install better cladding. But flat owners say the rules around who pays are unfair, as more than half a million leaseholders may have to pay tens of thousands of pounds to fix potentially unsafe buildings. In the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed the lives of 72 people in 2017, the government pledged to improve building safety standards. As part of this, the Building Safety Fund was created to help pay for the removal and replacement of dangerous cladding on high-rise buildings.  However, leaseholders, who own their flats but not the freehold of the building, have argued that they should not be responsible for the costs of replacing unsafe cladding. They say that the responsibility should lie with developers and building owners, who were responsible for installing the unsafe cladding in the first place. The Fire Safety Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, would have introduced a new levy on developers to help pay for the costs of cladding replacement. However, MPs voted against an amendment to the Bill that would have required developers to pay for all the costs of cladding replacement. This means that leaseholders could still be liable for significant costs. Leaseholders have expressed their disappointment at the MPs' decision. They say that they are being unfairly penalized for the mistakes of developers and building owners. They are calling on the government to introduce a fairer system that would protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding replacement. The government has said that it is committed to protecting leaseholders and that it will continue to work on finding a solution to the cladding crisis. However, it is clear that the issue is far from resolved and that leaseholders could still be facing significant costs for cladding replacement. The Fire Safety Bill is expected to become law later this year. It will introduce a number of new measures to improve building safety, including: A new Building Safety Regulator to oversee the safety of high-rise buildings New requirements for developers to provide information about the fire safety of their buildings New powers for local authorities to take action against unsafe buildings The government hopes that these measures will help to prevent another tragedy like the Grenfell Tower fire. However, the issue of cladding replacement remains unresolved and could continue to be a major source of concern for leaseholders.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Manchester attack: Veil of quiet respect descends over city,"By Tom Mullen BBC News Online Tuesday's proud show of solidarity and defiance at a vigil in Albert Square appears to have given way to a sense of deep sadness, with dozens of people pausing to read the many messages left in St Ann's Square. There are flowers, candles and soft toys as well as messages of condolence and support, with some people quietly crying as they read what has been written. A veil of quiet respect has descended over the city centre, with even the trams pausing briefly as they pass the floral tributes which have been left near the scene of the attack. The city's main shopping centre, the Arndale Centre, reopened on Tuesday and, while there were fewer people than usual, those who were there said they felt safe. ""It's nice to be back in the city centre, but it's very strange to think that something so awful happened here,"" said Kelly Williams, 30, a healthcare worker. ""I think people are still in shock, but we're determined to show that we won't be beaten by terrorism. We're a strong city and we'll get through this together.""

BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei,"BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor BT said in time it expected 50% of all its 5G traffic to be transmitted via the Swedish company's kit. The move will let it ditch Huawei, the Chinese company that provides much of the UK's 4G and 5G equipment. The government has ordered telecoms operators to remove all Huawei equipment from their networks by 2027. BT has said it needed ""multiple vendors"" to ensure its network remained competitive. It explained that the Ericsson deal would deliver a ""significant"" number of new 5G sites. ""This deal means we can accelerate the rollout of our 5G network using the latest kit from a trusted and high-quality vendor,"" said Howard Watson, BT's chief technology officer. ""Ericsson's state-of-the-art kit will deliver significant benefits."" But the deal may not solve all BT's technology headaches. For example, it still relies on Huawei for its broadband network kit. And BT will have to balance its relationship with Ericsson with those of its other suppliers, especially Nokia and Samsung. BT owns the UK's largest mobile phone network, EE. Two years ago, BT struck a major deal with Nokia to replace Huawei equipment in the core of its 5G network. But unlike Huawei, Ericsson also has an established radio access network (RAN) hardware business. The RAN is the part of the network that connects mobile phone masts to the core network and the internet. The Huawei ban and other issues had been expected to delay BT's 5G rollout plans. But Mr Watson said the deal with Ericsson would ""accelerate"" its 5G deployment. In a separate statement, Ericsson said it was ""delighted to strengthen our long-standing partnership with BT"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Chevron: Indigenous Ecuadoreans seek higher damages,"By Irene Caselli BBC News, Ecuador A triumphant atmosphere might have been expected as they gathered for a news conference in Quito, given the favourable verdict finally reached in a case that had been grinding through the Ecuadorian and US legal systems for 28 years. But for the four Indigenous leaders, representing more than 30,000 Ecuadorean Amazonians, the moment was bittersweet. ""We never thought it would take so long, so many of our friends died waiting for this verdict. They gave their lives in the struggle,"" said Pablo Fajardo, speaking on behalf of his community, and a member of the Cofan people. The landmark decision by Ecuador's highest court at the end of February found Chevron, the US oil giant, responsible for massive contamination in the Amazon, which included dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into rivers, contaminating the drinking water and killing wildlife. The court upheld a lower court ruling that ordered Chevron to pay $9.5bn (£7bn) in damages - one of the biggest environmental fines in history. Chevron has always denied the allegations and said it will fight the verdict. It says the clean-up was carried out by state-owned oil company Petroecuador, with which it worked in partnership. The Indigenous communities say the environmental disaster has had a devastating impact on their lives. They have suffered serious health problems, including cancer, and contamination of their water supplies has deprived them of their main source of food. ""Our children are fishing in a polluted river... and eating fish that have mercury,"" said Fajardo. ""We feel so much sadness. We have lost everything due to Chevron,"" he said. The communities want more money from Chevron to help them to overcome the damage that has been done. ""The verdict is a first step towards justice, but it should not end there. Chevron must repair the damage it has done and compensate the communities who have suffered,"" said Fajardo. The communities are also calling on the Ecuadorian government to step up its efforts to clean up the contamination. ""The government must play its part. We need a clean-up plan. We need compensation for the damage to our health and environment,"" said Fajardo. The case has been closely watched by environmental groups around the world and is seen as a test case for the accountability of oil giants for the environmental damage they cause.

China morning round-up: Illegal workers,"Shanghai Daily says Vice-Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning told the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Wednesday that the crackdown was aimed at curbing ""smuggling, theft, robbery and other crimes"". Police caught 105,274 illegal workers and 5,670 employers between January and August 2023, and imposed fines totalling 260 million yuan ($37m; £30m), he said. The Global Times said the crackdown was not new and that the authorities had been ""vowing to ensure 'dynamic zero-Covid' and social stability"". It said the police operation involved ""coordinated efforts"" requiring ""multiple city-level departments"". The crackdown is part of a wider drive by the Chinese government to clamp down on illegal activities and maintain social order. In recent months, the authorities have also launched crackdowns on online scams, telecommunications fraud and food safety violations. The Chinese government has long been concerned about the issue of illegal workers, who are often paid less than the minimum wage and lack basic labour protections. In 2019, the government introduced a new law aimed at cracking down on the illegal employment of foreign workers. The crackdown on illegal workers is likely to continue in the coming months as the Chinese government seeks to strengthen its control over the labour market and maintain social stability. The move has been welcomed by some, who say it will help to protect the rights of workers and ensure that businesses are operating fairly. However, others have expressed concern that the crackdown could lead to discrimination against migrant workers and make it more difficult for them to find work. The crackdown is also likely to have a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Illegal workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in many sectors, such as construction and manufacturing. The crackdown could lead to labour shortages and higher labour costs, which could in turn lead to higher prices for goods and services. The crackdown on illegal workers is a complex issue with both positive and negative consequences. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks of the crackdown before making a judgment about its overall impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'I'm gay and I was sexually assaulted by a woman',"By Shiona McCallum Newsbeat reporter He says he ""didn't feel under threat"" by his attacker, Cheryl Cottrell, because she was a woman. The film-maker, who is gay, has been struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts since. ""I didn't feel like I was under threat from her because I knew women can't physically overpower men,"" he says. ""But it doesn't change the fact that I was sexually assaulted. I still felt like a victim."" He says the culture surrounding male victims of sexual violence makes it hard for them to come forward and speak out about their experiences. ""There's a lot of stigma around men being victims of sexual assault,"" he says. ""There's this idea that men are supposed to be strong and powerful, and that if they're assaulted then they're not a 'real man'. ""This needs to change. Men need to be able to come forward and talk about their experiences without feeling ashamed or embarrassed."" He hopes that by speaking out about his experience, he can help to break down the stigma surrounding male victims of sexual violence. ""I want people to understand that sexual assault can happen to anyone, regardless of their gender,"" he says. ""I want men to know that they're not alone, and that if they've been assaulted, they should come forward and seek help.""

Brexit: Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity',"Construction work on a site off the M20 near Ashford began earlier this month. One resident labelled the plans ""sneaky"", stating she had not been told about them. The Department for Transport said ""commercial sensitivities made it impossible to engage with local residents"" before work started. The site is one of three disused airfields, along with Manston in Kent and Stanford in Essex, being transformed into lorry parks for Operation Brock, which is intended to reduce disruption at the Port of Dover in the event of cross-Channel disruption. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke and Ashford MP Damian Green have raised concerns about the impact on the local area following complaints from residents. The MPs said the airfields were ""completely the wrong locations"" for the lorry parks and called on the government to reconsider. The government said the sites were chosen for their ""good access to motorways"" and other nearby infrastructure. However, residents in Sevington, a village on the outskirts of Ashford, have expressed anger at the lack of consultation over the plans. ""It's like a concrete monstrosity,"" said one resident, who asked not to be named. ""It's going to ruin our village."" Another resident said he had not been told about the plans until work started. ""I'm really concerned about the impact it's going to have on the environment,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of wildlife around here and this is just going to destroy it."" The Department for Transport said it had been ""engaging with local residents and businesses throughout the planning and development process"". ""We understand that some residents may have concerns about the impact of the lorry park on their local area,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are committed to working with the local community to address these concerns and minimize any disruption."" But residents say they have not been given enough information about the plans. ""We've been completely ignored,"" said one resident. ""The government hasn't even bothered to tell us what's going on."" The government has said the lorry parks will be temporary and will only be used when necessary to ease congestion at the Port of Dover. However, residents fear that the parks will become permanent fixtures and that their villages will be blighted by noise, pollution, and traffic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Love Island to return this summer, ITV confirms","However, the broadcaster has not announced any further details, such as the location of the villa. Previous summer series have taken place in Mallorca, but reports this week suggested ITV had identified a new location in Italy. The series will be the first full series to air since the winter version was shown in January 2023. It was won by Finn Tapp and Paige Turley, who remain one of only two Love Island couples still together from their winning series. The first series of Love Island aired in 2015 and was won by Jess Hayes and Max Morley. Since then, the show has become one of ITV's most popular, with over 20 million viewers tuning in for the 2022 final. The show has also been a success internationally, with versions of Love Island airing in over 20 countries. The US version of the show, which airs on CBS, is currently in its fourth season. Love Island has been praised for its entertainment value and for introducing viewers to new personalities. However, it has also been criticised for its lack of diversity and for promoting unrealistic body standards. In recent years, ITV has made efforts to address these criticisms. In 2021, the broadcaster introduced new rules to ensure that all contestants are treated with respect and that there is no bullying or harassment. ITV has also committed to increasing the diversity of the show's contestants. In 2022, the show featured its first ever deaf contestant, Tasha Ghouri. The return of Love Island is sure to be a major event in the television calendar. The show is expected to be full of drama, romance, and plenty of sunshine.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Preston GP struck off over 'dishonest' food poisoning claims,"A tribunal found the actions of Dr Zuber Bux, who practised in the Preston area in Lancashire, were ""misleading, dishonest and financially motivated"". The panel also proved he failed to declare his wife Sehana Bux, who helped run his clinics, as a director of his company. The tribunal heard evidence that Dr Bux had claimed to be a travel health expert and recommended unnecessary vaccinations to around 1,300 patients. He also provided letters to patients claiming they had food poisoning, which they could use to claim compensation from travel companies. The tribunal chairman, Dr Nigel Murray, said: ""The repeated, dishonest claims made by Dr Zuber Bux were rooted in financial gain. He sought to portray himself as an expert in travel health, when in fact he had no such expertise. ""His actions were a betrayal of the trust placed in him by his patients and brought the medical profession into disrepute."" Dr Bux qualified as a doctor in Pakistan in 1987 and moved to the UK in 1990. He worked as a GP in the Preston area for many years and was the medical director of two clinics, Travel Clinic UK and Bux Medical Centre. In 2016, the General Medical Council (GMC) began an investigation into Dr Bux's conduct after receiving a number of complaints from patients. The investigation found that Dr Bux had been making false claims about his qualifications and experience, and that he had been providing patients with unnecessary vaccinations. Dr Bux was suspended from practising medicine in 2017 and the GMC referred his case to a tribunal. The tribunal heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including patients who had been treated by Dr Bux. The tribunal found that Dr Bux had breached a number of GMC rules, including those relating to honesty, integrity and financial probity. The tribunal also found that he had failed to declare his wife as a director of his company, which was a breach of company law. The tribunal's decision to strike Dr Bux off the medical register means that he will no longer be able to practise medicine in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Teletubbies creator 'sad' about show's remake,"Wood, 77, told Radio Times she is not a fan of the trend for remaking old shows such as Dangermouse. ""I think we've got to move on,"" she argued. ""There's still room for new ideas."" Wood created Teletubbies with her husband, Andrew Davenport, and it first aired on BBC Two in 1997. The show quickly became a global hit, with its distinctive characters, bright colors, and soothing narrations. However, it has also been criticized for its slow pace and repetitive plots. Despite the criticism, Teletubbies has remained popular with young children, and it has been praised for its educational value. In 2015, it was named one of the BBC's most popular children's shows of all time. The remake of Teletubbies is being produced by DHX Media, the Canadian company that bought the rights to the show in 2013. The new series will feature a new cast of actors and a number of changes to the original format. Wood said she has not been involved in the remake and does not know much about it. However, she said she is ""sad"" that her show is being remade. ""I think it's a shame,"" she said. ""I think it's a beautiful show, and it's a shame to see it remade."" Wood's comments come at a time when there is a growing trend for remaking old children's shows. In recent years, there have been remakes of shows such as Thunderbirds, The Wombles, and The Clangers. Some critics argue that this trend is a sign of a lack of creativity in the television industry. However, others argue that remakes can introduce classic shows to a new generation of viewers. It remains to be seen whether the new Teletubbies series will be a success. However, Wood's comments suggest that she is unlikely to be a fan.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Depression: 'Second biggest cause of disability' in world,"By Helen Briggs BBC News The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other health conditions and found that it is the second leading cause of disability worldwide and the top cause in several countries including the UK, US and Australia. The researchers estimated that more than 300 million people globally are living with depression, and it could cost the world economy more than $1 trillion (£750 bn) a year. That's in lost productivity, as well as direct healthcare costs. The study, funded by the World Health Organization, also found that depression is more disabling than many other chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Lead researcher Professor Alize Ferrari of the University of Queensland in Australia said: ""Our findings show that mental disorders, and in particular depression, are not only common, but they cause more suffering and disability than most other conditions."" ""This means that depression should be one of the main health challenges that governments and health systems address for their populations worldwide."" The researchers hope the study will help convince governments and health organisations to invest more resources in mental health. ""Depression can be treated, but too often does not get the attention it deserves,"" said Prof Ferrari. ""We need to reduce the stigma associated with depression so people can come forward and seek help to manage their illness."" She said mental health services should be available and affordable for all. ""We need to move depression from the margins to the mainstream of health."" The study was based on data from 188 countries and analysed information from the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease Study, which includes information on 301 health conditions and their impact on population health. The researchers calculated the disability caused by depression using a measure called years lived with disability (YLDs). YLDs measure the number of years lived with a health condition, weighted to reflect the severity of the condition. The researchers found that people with depression had an average of 8.9 YLDs, which is more than the number of YLDs for diabetes (5.3), heart disease (4.7), and cancer (3.7). The study also found that the number of YLDs for depression has increased by more than 50% since 1990. The researchers say this is due to a number of factors, including population growth, ageing, and changes in lifestyle. They also say that the increase in YLDs for depression may be due to better diagnosis and reporting of the condition. However, they say that more research is needed to understand the reasons for the increase.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pound rises on Brexit 'progress' report,"Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News. However, the pound later gave up some of its gains after London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned that the UK capital's financial services industry could lose up to 100,000 jobs if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The reports from Brussels suggested that the EU and the UK were close to agreeing on a withdrawal deal, but that there were still some ""significant obstacles"" to overcome. The reports also suggested that the UK government was preparing to offer a ""significant financial incentive"" to the EU to help secure a deal. The pound has been volatile in recent weeks as investors try to assess the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Sterling fell to a 28-month low against the US dollar in August, but has since recovered some of its losses. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. If the UK leaves without a deal, it will mean that there will be no transition period and businesses will have to adapt to new trading arrangements overnight. This could lead to disruption to trade and a fall in the value of the pound. The EU has said that it is willing to grant the UK a transition period, but only if the UK agrees to pay a ""divorce bill"" of up to £40bn. The UK government has said that it is willing to pay a ""reasonable"" divorce bill, but has not yet agreed to the EU's figure. The negotiations between the UK and the EU are ongoing and it is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach a deal before the UK leaves the EU. If the UK does leave without a deal, it could have a significant impact on the UK economy and the value of the pound.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Europe-wide police operation busts horsemeat racket,"Police in Spain made 65 arrests for crimes including animal abuse, forgery, money laundering and racketeering. Horses in Portugal and Spain deemed unfit for consumption were slaughtered and their meat passed off as beef, police said. Europol, the EU's police agency, said the meat was sold in at least 25 countries across Europe, including the UK, France, Italy and Portugal. Some of it found its way into products destined for children, including burgers and lasagne. The operation began in February 2022, when Spanish police discovered horses being slaughtered in conditions that breached regulations. They found signs of ill-treatment, including animals with open wounds and broken bones. Police also discovered that the horses had been given drugs to make them appear younger and healthier. The meat was then sold to slaughterhouses and meat traders, who passed it off as beef. As well as the arrests in Spain, police in Portugal, France, Italy and the UK made a further 10 arrests. Europol said the operation had dismantled a ""major criminal network"" involved in the horsemeat racket. The operation is the latest in a series of investigations into the horsemeat trade in Europe. In 2013, a major scandal broke out when it was revealed that horsemeat had been found in products sold in supermarkets across Europe. The scandal led to a number of changes in the way that horsemeat is regulated in Europe. However, the latest operation suggests that the trade in horsemeat is still a problem. In a statement, Europol said the operation had ""demonstrated the importance of cooperation between law enforcement agencies across Europe"". ""This investigation has shown that the illegal horsemeat trade is a serious issue that poses a risk to public health and animal welfare,"" the statement said. ""Europol will continue to work with its partners to tackle this problem and bring those responsible to justice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sheffield shooting: Drive-by gunman guilty of attempted murder,"The boy suffered serious leg injuries when Stephen Dunford, 25, opened fire on a group of people in Northern Avenue, Sheffield, from a passing car. He was later recorded in jail bragging about the attack, saying he had ""burst"" his victim's kneecap and that he ""deserved it"" for disrespectful comments made in the past. Dunford, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempted murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday after a trial lasting almost four weeks. He will be sentenced on 29 March. The court heard how Dunford had been driving a black Audi A3 when he pulled up alongside a group of people in the street at about 18:00 GMT on 23 July last year. He wound down the window and fired four shots from a handgun towards the group. One of the bullets hit the boy in the leg, causing serious injuries. He was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery. Dunford fled the scene but was later arrested by police. When interviewed, he denied being involved in the shooting, but his DNA was found on the gun and in the car. The jury heard that Dunford had been friends with the victim's family but had fallen out with them after an argument. He had made threats to harm the victim in the past. In a statement released after the verdict, the victim's family said: ""We are relieved that Stephen Dunford has been found guilty of attempted murder. This has been a very difficult time for us, but we are grateful to the police and the jury for their hard work in bringing him to justice.

A killer's compulsion undimmed by time,"By Graeme Ogston BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter Sobs from the public seats from those whose lives he had changed forever, the passion in the Crown's closing speech, and the almost emotionless delivery of his own defence - there were many layers to the Ian Brady sentencing hearing. It was the culmination of years of patient and determined work by detectives, lawyers and forensic experts. The evil and the banality had co-existed in Brady throughout his life and both were present in court. His voice devoid of any emotion as he addressed the judge, Brady described himself as a ""political prisoner"" and accused the authorities of a ""witch hunt"". He made the bizarre claim that the Moors murders were somehow linked to his republican activities in Glasgow. It was clear though that the evidence against him was overwhelming. The description of his offending as ""grotesque and wicked beyond belief"" was not an exaggeration. The Crown narrative, illustrated by chilling black and white photographs, charted the manipulative grooming of vulnerable young victims, their torture, sexual abuse and murder. Brady maintained his innocence but the evidence against him was overwhelming. He and Myra Hindley lured five children to their deaths in the 1960s. Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans were subjected to unimaginable horrors before being murdered. In 1985, Brady was convicted of the murders of John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans and jailed for life. Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 for her part in the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey. She died in prison in 2002. Brady's bid to overturn his convictions in 2001 failed and he had been held at the high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside since 1985. He died in May 2017 at the age of 79. The judge who sentenced Brady to life in prison described him as ""wicked beyond belief"". In his closing speech, the prosecutor said that Brady's crimes were ""so heinous that they beggar belief"". He said that Brady was a ""sadistic and calculating killer"" who had shown no remorse for his crimes. Brady's crimes shocked the nation and continue to haunt those who were affected by them. His death brought an end to a chapter in British criminal history, but the pain and suffering he inflicted will never be forgotten.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Labour would also introduce a new 10-year NHS cancer plan, providing more treatments and support for patients. Mr Jones said: ""Cancer is a terrible disease that affects so many people."" ""We want to give people the best possible chance of beating it, and this plan will help us to do that."" The party would also create 100,000 apprenticeships, with a focus on new technologies and skills. Mr Jones said: ""We need to make sure that our young people have the skills they need to compete in the modern economy."" ""These apprenticeships will give them the chance to earn and learn, and to build a successful future for themselves."" Labour would also introduce free childcare for all three and four-year-olds, regardless of their family income.

""We want to make it easier for parents to balance their work and family life, and to give our children the best possible start in life."" Finally, Labour would introduce a scheme to help older people sell their homes to pay for care. Mr Jones said: ""We know that many older people are struggling to pay for care, and that can put a real strain on their finances."" ""This scheme would give them the option to sell their home, and to receive a lump sum that they can use to pay for their care.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ulster Bank apologises as thousands unable to access money,"It apologised for Monday evening's problems and said it would compensate anyone left out of pocket. Customers said they could not use cash machines, debit cards or access online or telephone banking.

Victims' Code criticised by watchdog,"Victims' Code criticised by watchdog Parliamentary Ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor said an investigation of complaints had exposed a lack of understanding. It came as ministers unveiled plans to revamp the code, which tells people what to expect from police, courts and other agencies after they have been a victim of crime. The code was introduced in April last year. Dame Julie was asked to look into it after receiving a high volume of complaints. Her report, published on Wednesday, found that complainants often did not understand the code and were not given enough information by agencies at the outset. She said victims were often forced to chase up agencies to find out about their case and that some agencies had a ""narrow and minimalist"" approach to the code. Dame Julie said: ""I am concerned that the Victims' Code is not currently providing all victims with the information and support they have a right to expect. ""The code must be made easier to understand and agencies must be given clearer guidance on how to implement it effectively. ""I hope that my recommendations will help to improve the experience of victims and ensure that they are treated with the respect and compassion they deserve."" Dame Julie made a number of recommendations, including: The code should be simplified and made easier to understand Agencies should provide more information to victims at the outset Agencies should be given clearer guidance on how to implement the code There should be an independent body to monitor the implementation of the code Justice Minister Sir Oliver Heald said the government was ""committed to improving the experience of victims"". He said: ""We will carefully consider the ombudsman's recommendations and will set out our response in due course.""

It was introduced in April 2015 and replaced the previous Code of Practice for Victims of Crime. The code covers a range of issues, including: Information and support for victims The right to make a victim personal statement The right to be kept informed about the progress of their case The right to attend court hearings The right to compensation",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"'Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council","Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council By Hannah Richardson BBC News education reporter Buckinghamshire County Council's comments came in response to a school wanting to use 11-plus results to decide who gets priority on new places. The council's response said that the test ""is an imperfect measure of ability"" and that ""it is well known that family income and wealth are closely linked with attainment at 11"". This would mean that ""the pupils who would most benefit from a grammar school education would be less likely to secure a place"". Former education secretary Justine Greening said the claims were ""a deeply depressing indictment of the current system"". She said: ""It's a further indication that the system is failing too many children from disadvantaged backgrounds."" But a spokesman for the Grammar Schools Heads Association said there was no evidence the 11-plus ""works against pupils from poorer backgrounds"". He said: ""In fact, there is evidence to suggest the opposite, that grammar schools help to close the attainment gap."" The National Education Union believes the focus should be on improving results for all pupils, rather than creating a two-tier system. Joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The NEU's position is that we do not support selective education. ""We would prefer to see all schools supported and funded to improve the academic achievement of the whole school community."" The debate over grammar schools has been reignited by the government's plans to open new ones. The government says that grammar schools will help to raise standards for all pupils, but critics argue that they will lead to a more segregated and unequal education system. The 11-plus is a test that is taken by children in England at the age of 11. The results of the test are used to decide which children will go to grammar schools, which are selective schools that are often seen as being the best schools in the country. The test is controversial, with some people arguing that it is unfair and that it discriminates against children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Milk cuts campaign launched by Scottish farmers,"It comes after Robert Wiseman, Britain's biggest fresh milk company, said it would reduce the farm-gate milk price by 1.7p a litre from 1 August. Wiseman blamed the ""increasing pressure"" of cheaper imported milk, with the UK seeing record levels of dairy imports in recent months. The Scottish government said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Wiseman's decision, and that it would ""stand up for Scotland's dairy industry"". ""Dairy farmers are facing a significant challenge at present, with rising costs and volatile milk prices,"" said Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing. ""The Scottish government will continue to work closely with the industry to find solutions."" The NFU Scotland said Wiseman's decision was a ""kick in the teeth"" for dairy farmers. ""Dairy farmers are already operating on wafer-thin margins, and this price cut will make it even harder for them to make a living,"" said NFU Scotland President Andrew McCornick. ""We urge Wiseman to reconsider this decision."" The Scottish Milk Campaign is calling on consumers to buy Scottish milk and dairy products in a bid to support the industry. ""Scottish milk is some of the best in the world, and we need to do everything we can to support our dairy farmers,"" said campaign coordinator Jean Lamont. ""By buying Scottish milk, you can help to protect one of Scotland's most iconic industries."" The campaign is also calling on the Scottish government to do more to support the dairy industry. ""The Scottish government needs to step up and provide more support for our dairy farmers,"" said Lamont.

"Children in care 'let down for too long', says David Cameron","Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care. New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even if they have a history of challenging behaviour. The article was prompted by the publication of a report from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which found that thousands of children were abused while in care. The inquiry concluded that the state had ""failed"" these children and that there was a ""culture of denial"" about the extent of the abuse. Cameron's article was welcomed by some campaigners, but others said it did not go far enough. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the government needed to do more to ensure that all children in care are safe and that those who have been abused are properly supported. The NSPCC's chief executive, Peter Wanless, said: ""We welcome the prime minister's commitment to 'zero tolerance' of state failure in childcare. However, we believe that the government needs to go further and commit to a national inquiry into the sexual abuse of children in care."" The government has said that it will consider the inquiry's recommendations carefully. However, it is not yet clear what specific measures the government will take to improve the care of children in care. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was set up in 2014 to investigate child sexual abuse in England and Wales over the past 60 years. The inquiry has heard evidence from more than 7,000 victims and witnesses. The inquiry's report found that there was a ""culture of denial"" about the extent of child sexual abuse in care. The report also found that the state had ""failed"" to protect children from abuse and that there were ""systemic failures"" in the care system. The government has apologized for the state's failures to protect children in care.

Rickmansworth man Davey Everson jailed for Millie-Rose Burdett murder,"Davey Everson, 23, had been convicted of the murder of three-month-old Millie-Rose Burdett, who died in hospital on 11 January 2019. A judge at the Old Bailey said he must serve a minimum of 13 years and six months before being considered for release. The court heard that Everson had been in a relationship with Millie-Rose's mother, Nalini Thakor, and had been looking after the baby at their home in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, when she suffered a fatal head injury. Everson initially claimed that Millie-Rose had fallen off a bed, but a post-mortem examination found that she had died from blunt force trauma to the head. Everson was arrested and charged with murder in January 2019. During the trial, the jury heard that Everson had been violent towards Thakor in the past and had threatened to kill her. He had also been seen shaking Millie-Rose on a number of occasions. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said that Everson had shown ""no remorse"" for his actions and had been ""utterly selfish"". He said that the baby had been ""vulnerable and defenceless"" and that Everson had ""taken her life in a moment of anger"". ""This was a cruel and senseless killing of a defenceless baby,"" Judge Lucraft said. ""You have shown no remorse for your actions and you have been utterly selfish. You deserve to spend a long time in prison."" Everson's sentence was welcomed by Millie-Rose's family. In a statement, they said: ""We are relieved that justice has been done and that Davey Everson has been sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment. We hope that this will send a message that violence against children will not be tolerated."" The case of Millie-Rose Burdett's murder has shocked the community of Rickmansworth. Local residents have expressed their anger and sadness at the death of such a young child. A vigil was held in her memory in the town centre in January 2019. The case has also raised awareness of the issue of violence against children. The NSPCC has said that it is ""horrified"" by the death of Millie-Rose and has called for more to be done to protect children from harm.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Lockdown 'could boost wild flowers',"Plantlife has been urging councils for years to cut grass less often. It also wants them to delay cutting until flowers have had chance to seed. The charity says it has seen signs of a change in the management of roadside verges during lockdown. On the M1 near Sheffield, a verge has been left to grow. Plantlife said that this was now a spectacular display of wildflowers. It wants to see verges like this retained on the motorway network as part of the ""nature recovery network"" that the government has proposed. Councils around the country have reported a surge in the number of calls they have received about people spotting wildlife in their areas. This is likely to be because people are spending more time in their local parks and green spaces during lockdown. In one park in Burnley, Lancashire, people have been surprised by the appearance of purple orchids, foxgloves and birdsfoot trefoil. A council spokesman said that the wildflowers had benefited from the reduction in the number of dog walkers and the fact that the grass had not been cut. “The wildflowers are a real joy to see,” he said. “They are a reminder of the importance of protecting our green spaces.” Plantlife is calling for a change in the way that we manage our green spaces. It wants to see a move away from the intensive mowing of verges and parks. This would allow wildflowers to flourish and create a more diverse habitat for wildlife. The charity is also urging people to plant wildflowers in their gardens. This would help to create a network of habitats for pollinators and other insects. “We need to change the way we think about wildflowers,” said Plantlife’s chief executive, Ian Dunn. “They are not just weeds. They are a vital part of our ecosystem.” The lockdown has given us a glimpse of what our green spaces could be like if we managed them differently. Let’s hope that we can learn from this experience and create a more sustainable future for our wildlife.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Russians fly orphan bear to new life,"By News from Elsewhere...as found by BBC Monitoring Villagers in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula found the starving 10-month-old roaming their freezing streets last month, crying out for food. Locals tried to care for the animal, which they named Venza, but realised he needed specialist treatment. A local resident contacted the Kamchatka animal welfare group Wild Rescue Centre and founder Viktoria Ignatieva travelled 120km (75 miles) from the regional capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to collect the bear. She told the BBC's Russian service that at first she didn't want to get involved. ""We don't work with bears,"" she said. ""But then I heard his screams."" Viktoria said Venza was very weak and was having trouble feeding because his teeth had not fully developed. He was dehydrated, malnourished and had wounds on his paws. She was able to find a sponsor who would pay for the bear's flight to Moscow, where he could receive specialist care at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. She then had to wait for several days for permission from the authorities to transport the bear. Viktoria took the opportunity to buy baby food and a bottle with a small teat, which the bear accepted immediately. ""It was difficult to feed him, he was too weak,"" she said. ""After a few hours he was already sleeping on his tummy and dreaming."" Venza's welfare flight was part of a joint initiative from the Wild Rescue Centre and Russian airline S7. The flight attendant monitored Venza throughout the journey, stroking his head and giving him baby food. Venza is now recovering at the Moscow wildlife centre, where he is being introduced to berries and vegetables. The centre's director, Vladimir Burdachevsky, described him as ""very sweet"". ""It's sad that he lost his mother,"" he said. ""But he is in good hands and we will do everything we can to prepare him for life in the wild."" Venza is expected to stay at the centre for up to a year. He will then be released into a protected area in the Russian Far East. Viktoria said: ""We're already thinking about his life in the wild. He has to be ready to live alone. He will be under the supervision of the Kamchatka Natural Resources Ministry, using a GPS tracker."" She added: ""It's the first time in Russia that an orphaned bear cub has been rescued and we hope it sends out the message that we should all care about the wild animals who share this planet with us.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""This is a worrying development and we are working closely with our partners to do everything we can to bring this situation under control.""

Norman Baker: EU would slow down 'legal highs' fight,"By Justin Parkinson Political reporter, BBC News The Liberal Democrat told a parliamentary committee the UK was already in a ""stronger position"" than most states, as it had flexibility to act act quickly. The coalition has banned more than 50 so-called legal highs since coming to power in 2010, with a further 10 substances set to be added to the list by the end of the year. But Mr Baker said the UK could do more and that he was ""disappointed"" the EU had blocked plans for a European-wide ban on psychoactive substances. ""I think we'd be in a stronger position as a country if we weren't part of that process,"" he said. ""We could go ahead with what we were planning and ban these things more quickly than we are able to at the moment."" The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it is not convinced that a ban is the best way to tackle the problem. It has instead proposed a ""balanced"" approach which would include monitoring the market, providing information and support to users, and encouraging research. The commission's position has been backed by some experts, who argue that a ban could simply drive the market underground and make it more difficult to control. But Mr Baker said he was not convinced by these arguments. ""I think the evidence suggests that a ban can be effective in reducing the availability of these substances,"" he said. ""And I think it's important to send a clear message that these substances are not acceptable."" The Home Office has said it is ""disappointed"" by the EU's decision, but that it will continue to work with other countries to tackle the problem. The government has also said it will continue to ban new psychoactive substances as they emerge. In the meantime, Mr Baker said he would be looking at ways to ""speed up"" the process of banning these substances. ""I think we need to be more proactive in this area,"" he said. ""We need to be doing everything we can to protect people from these dangerous substances.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The British Legion's call for a public inquiry comes after a number of high-profile cases of veterans suffering from Gulf War illnesses. In 2019, the BBC reported on the case of Corporal Diane Allen, who died from a rare form of cancer after serving in the Gulf War. Allen's family believe that her cancer was caused by her exposure to depleted uranium, which is used in armor-piercing shells. The Ministry of Defence has denied any link between depleted uranium and Gulf War illnesses. The British Legion's call for a public inquiry is likely to be met with resistance from the government. The government has previously said that there is no evidence to support the claim that Gulf War illnesses are caused by exposure to depleted uranium.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dale Farm eviction: 'Show of force designed to shock',"By Julian Sturdy BBC East The police, the travellers were told, would only be there to maintain the peace and prevent criminality. But, they said, they had broken no laws. So why, they asked, were there 4,000 police officers, many in riot gear, backed up by water cannon and a helicopter? ""We're not moving and we don't know why they're here,"" said Kathleen McCarthy, who along with her husband John has lived at Dale Farm for 20 years. ""We feel let down. We are being treated like animals."" The community living on the Dale Farm site, just off the A12 in Essex, felt they had been given reassurances that they would not face immediate eviction. But on Wednesday, 19 October, the police moved in. Travellers have long complained that they face prejudice and discrimination, but they say the way they have been treated at Dale Farm is unprecedented. ""We are not criminals,"" said Mary Sheridan, who came to Dale Farm with her family eight years ago. ""We have done nothing wrong."" The travellers say they are simply trying to live a traditional way of life. ""We're not asking for much,"" said Kathleen McCarthy. ""We don't want to be millionaires. We just want to live a quiet life."" But the authorities say that the Dale Farm site is illegal and that the travellers have ignored repeated court orders to leave. The eviction, which is expected to take several days, is the largest of its kind in British history. The police have said that they are using ""proportionate and necessary force"" to ensure that the eviction is carried out safely and without violence. But the travellers say that the police are using excessive force. ""They're treating us like we're animals,"" said Mary Sheridan. ""They're trying to scare us into leaving."" The travellers have vowed to stay put. ""We're not going to give up without a fight,"" said Kathleen McCarthy. ""We're going to make them drag us out."" The eviction of Dale Farm is a complex and controversial issue. The travellers say they are being unfairly targeted, while the authorities say they are simply enforcing the law. The outcome of the eviction will have far-reaching implications for the future of traveller communities in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Venezuela ex-prosecutor: I have proof of Maduro corruption,"Luisa Ortega also accused two party leaders and the new prosecutor. Ms Ortega, who fled Venezuela last week after she was sacked and her husband was jailed, claimed that Maduro had created a network of corruption and extortion to line his own pockets. She said he had set up ""frontmen and strawmen"" who had made ""millions of dollars"" from overcharging the state for government contracts and then laundering the money through foreign banks. Ortega said she had evidence to back up her allegations and that she was willing to provide it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. She said she had already spoken to the ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and that she was ""confident"" that the court would open an investigation. The Venezuelan government has dismissed Ortega's allegations as ""baseless"" and ""politically motivated."" Maduro has accused her of being a ""traitor"" and a ""criminal"" who is trying to destabilize the country. Ortega's allegations are likely to further damage Maduro's already fragile credibility. He has been under increasing pressure from both within and outside Venezuela to step down, and his approval ratings have plummeted in recent months. If the ICC does open an investigation into Maduro, it would be a major blow to his presidency and could lead to his eventual downfall. The ICC is a court of last resort that investigates and prosecutes individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Ortega's allegations are likely to be welcomed by the Venezuelan opposition, which has been calling for Maduro to step down for months. The opposition has been struggling to regain momentum in recent months, but Ortega's allegations could give them a new lease of life. The Venezuelan government has accused Ortega of being part of a ""coup attempt"" and has said that she will be arrested if she returns to the country. However, Ortega has said that she is not afraid of being arrested and that she will continue to fight for justice in Venezuela.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tesla's Elon Musk may be in contempt over tweet,"His comments came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the courts to hold him in contempt for violating a settlement aimed at limiting his social media comments. The rule, agreed to by Musk in 2018, requires him to have his tweets pre-approved by a lawyer if they contain information that could affect Tesla's stock price. Musk's defiance is the latest in a series of clashes with the SEC, which has accused him of repeatedly misleading investors. In 2018, Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, causing the company's stock price to spike. The SEC subsequently charged Musk with fraud, and he settled with the agency without admitting or denying wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine. He also agreed to have his tweets pre-approved by a lawyer if they contained information that could affect Tesla's stock price. However, Musk has repeatedly violated the agreement, tweeting about Tesla's production goals, financial performance, and other topics without seeking pre-approval. In September 2022, he tweeted that Tesla would sell ""about 50%"" more cars in 2023 than it did in 2022. The SEC has accused Musk of misleading investors with this tweet, as Tesla's production and delivery numbers have fallen short of his projections. Musk's latest comments come as the SEC is investigating whether he violated the settlement again by tweeting about Tesla's planned stock split. On April 5, 2023, Musk tweeted that Tesla would split its stock in a 3-for-1 ratio. The SEC is now investigating whether Musk had proper approval for this tweet, as it could have affected Tesla's stock price. If the SEC finds that Musk violated the settlement, he could face a range of penalties, including fines, imprisonment, or being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC could also seek to appoint a monitor to oversee Musk's compliance with the settlement. Musk's defiance of the SEC is a sign of his growing frustration with the agency. He has repeatedly accused the SEC of overreach and has said that he does not believe that he needs to comply with its rules. Musk's behavior is likely to further strain his relationship with the SEC and could lead to more legal challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dundee University to tackle hepatitis in Tayside drug users,"Working alongside NHS Tayside, researchers hope to reduce the number of hepatitis C infections by targeting drug users at an early stage. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus which can cause serious liver damage.  The new project at Dundee University will involve running two screening clinics in the city, offering testing to drug users who are not already receiving treatment. The study team will also carry out focus groups and interviews with drug users to understand their knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to hepatitis C. This work will help researchers to develop more effective ways to engage with and support this population. Hepatitis C is a major public health concern in Tayside, with an estimated 1,200 people living with the condition. The virus is spread through contact with infected blood, and can be transmitted through injecting drug use, sharing needles and equipment, or having unprotected sex with an infected person. Around 20% of people with hepatitis C will go on to develop serious liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but treatment can be very effective in preventing the development of serious liver disease. Professor Chris Newman, who is leading the study, said: ""Hepatitis C is a serious condition, but it is one that can be prevented and treated. We know that drug users are at high risk of infection, but many of them are not aware of their status. This project will allow us to reach out to this population and offer them testing and support."" The study is funded by the Medical Research Council and will run for three years. The research team hope that the findings will help to inform future public health policy and improve the care of drug users in Tayside. In addition to the screening clinics, the research team will also be working with local drug services to raise awareness of hepatitis C and to promote testing. They will also be developing new educational resources for drug users and healthcare professionals. The project is part of a wider effort by NHS Tayside to tackle hepatitis C in the region. The health board has already introduced a number of measures to improve testing and treatment for hepatitis C, including offering free testing to all drug users and providing access to new antiviral treatments.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The heartbreak of watching the slow death of ash trees,"At primary school I remember learning how to identify trees by their leaves or bark. The one I was most interested in spotting was the ash, with its distinctive black bark and diamond-shaped leaves. It was the tree we built dens in, climbed to the highest branches, and swung from on long ropes tied to low-hanging limbs. As an adult, I was lucky enough to spend much of my childhood in the countryside, where towering ash trees were everywhere. I would play in woodland, surrounded by their elegant trunks, and marvel at their ability to soar so high into the sky. The ash was a symbol of strength and resilience, a constant in my life. But over the past few years, I have watched with increasing sadness as ash trees have fallen victim to a devastating disease called ash dieback. Caused by a fungus spread by wind and insects, it has decimated ash populations across Europe since it was first identified in the UK in 2012. The fungus infects the leaves of ash trees, causing them to turn brown and die back. In the early stages, the tree may only lose a few leaves, but as the disease progresses, it will spread throughout the canopy, eventually leading to the tree's death. I have seen firsthand the devastation that ash dieback can cause. In one woodland near my home, I have watched as row after row of ash trees have been felled, leaving behind a barren landscape. The once-vibrant green canopy is now a patchwork of brown and grey, and the sound of birdsong has been replaced by an eerie silence. It is not just the loss of the trees themselves that is so heartbreaking. Ash trees are home to a wide variety of wildlife, including insects, birds, and mammals. The loss of these trees will have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, affecting everything from the food chain to the water cycle. I know that there is no easy solution to ash dieback. The fungus is highly contagious, and there is no known cure. However, there is still hope. Scientists are working on developing resistant ash trees, and there are a number of things we can do to slow the spread of the disease. We can avoid moving infected plant material, clean our shoes and equipment after visiting infected areas, and plant new ash trees in areas where they are less likely to be exposed to the fungus. By working together, we can help to protect our ash trees and ensure that they continue to be a part of our landscape for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Criminal injury compensation cuts to be reconsidered,"The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had wanted to restrict payments from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to those suffering serious injuries. But an MoJ spokesman said: ""We recognise the strong feelings about this issue and we want to reassure people that no decisions have been made. We are committed to supporting victims of crime and are looking carefully at all the evidence before making any decisions."" The MoJ's original proposals would have meant that only those who had suffered a ""serious physical or mental injury"" would be eligible for compensation. This would have excluded people who had suffered less serious injuries, such as broken bones or bruising. The proposals were met with widespread criticism from victims' groups and lawyers. They argued that the changes would have left many victims of crime without adequate support. The Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, said: ""These proposals are a betrayal of victims of crime. They would deny compensation to thousands of people who have suffered real harm."" The Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: ""The government's proposals are a retrograde step. They would leave many victims of crime without the financial support they need to rebuild their lives."" The government's decision to reconsider the proposals is a welcome victory for victims' groups. However, it is important to note that no decisions have been made and the MoJ could still decide to implement the changes in the future. In the meantime, victims of crime are advised to continue to apply for compensation under the current scheme. The scheme is open to anyone who has been physically or mentally injured as a result of a crime. To apply for compensation, victims must complete a claim form and submit it to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). The CICA will then assess the claim and decide whether to award compensation. The amount of compensation awarded will depend on the severity of the injuries suffered. The maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded is £500,000. Victims of crime can also claim for loss of earnings, medical expenses, and other expenses. The CICA can also provide support services, such as counselling and therapy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Harry Uzoka death: Three guilty of killing London model,"George Koh, 24, stabbed fellow model Harry Uzoka in the heart after he went to settle the dispute, accompanied by two friends on 11 January last year. Koh, Jonathan Okigbo, 25, and Merse Dikanda, 25, were unanimously found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey on Friday. Uzoka, 25, was killed in Shepherd's Bush, west London, after he intervened in a row between Okigbo and his girlfriend, Blessing Douglas. The court heard that Uzoka and Koh had been friends, but they had fallen out after Koh allegedly made unwanted advances towards Douglas. On the night of the murder, Uzoka went to the flat where the row was taking place with two friends, Elliott Johnson and Adrian Harper. Koh, Okigbo and Dikanda were outside the flat when Uzoka and his friends arrived. A fight broke out, and Koh stabbed Uzoka in the chest. Uzoka was taken to hospital, but he died a short time later. Koh, Okigbo and Dikanda all denied murder, claiming they acted in self-defence. However, the jury rejected their claims and found them guilty of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Eastwood, who led the investigation, said: ""This was a senseless and tragic death of a young man who had his whole life ahead of him. ""Harry Uzoka was a popular and well-respected member of the community, and his death has been a huge loss to his family and friends. ""The defendants have shown no remorse for their actions, and they deserve to spend a long time in prison."" Uzoka's family said in a statement: ""Harry was a kind and loving son, brother and friend. He was taken from us far too soon, and we will never get over his loss. ""We want to thank the police and the CPS for their hard work in bringing the defendants to justice. ""We hope that this verdict will bring some closure to our family and friends, and that Harry's memory will live on.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Meryl Streep: Golden Globes organisers endorse speech,"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) described the actress as a ""class act"" after her speech at the ceremony on Sunday, in which she took aim at US President-elect Donald Trump. The 67-year-old actress, who was honoured with the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, used her acceptance speech to criticise Trump's ""disrespect"" of women. She said: ""Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose."" Her comments were met with a standing ovation from the audience, and have been widely praised by critics. The HFPA, which organises the Golden Globes, said in a statement: ""Meryl Streep's speech was a powerful and moving reminder of the importance of free speech and the role of the press in holding those in power accountable. ""We are proud to have presented her with the Cecil B. DeMille award, and we stand with her in her commitment to fighting for justice and equality."" Streep's speech has been interpreted by some as a direct attack on Trump, who has been accused of making sexist and misogynistic remarks in the past. Trump has not yet responded to Streep's comments, but he has previously dismissed her as an ""over-rated actress"". Streep's speech has been widely praised by celebrities and politicians alike. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted: ""Meryl Streep's speech was powerful and inspiring. Thank you for speaking out for justice and equality."" Actor Mark Ruffalo tweeted: ""Meryl Streep's speech was everything. Brave, passionate, and true. Thank you for being a beacon of light in these dark times."" Streep's speech has also been praised by media organisations.

A Border Force cutter escorted the vessel to Dover, where the people on board were taken into the care of the Home Office. The two boats dealt with by French authorities were intercepted off the coast of Calais. The crossings come as the UK government continues to grapple with the issue of illegal immigration. In 2021, more than 28,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. The government has pledged to take action to reduce the number of crossings, including increasing the number of patrols in the Channel and working with the French authorities to prevent people from leaving French shores. However, charities have warned that the government's approach is not working and that more people are likely to risk their lives crossing the Channel in the coming months. The Refugee Council said: ""These latest crossings are a reminder of the desperate situation facing people who are forced to flee their homes. The government's hostile approach to asylum is not deterring people from crossing the Channel, but it is making their journeys more dangerous."" The Home Office said: ""We are committed to disrupting the activities of organised criminal gangs who are exploiting vulnerable people and putting their lives at risk. We are working closely with the French authorities to tackle this issue and to ensure that those who cross the Channel illegally are returned to France.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"UK 'needs more bureaucrats for Brexit', says ex-diplomat","Sir Simon Fraser was a trade negotiator in Europe and permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office until July 2015. ""I don't think we can avoid an increase in bureaucracy,"" he said, ""because there are more regulations that we will have to manage ourselves in the future that were previously managed at EU level."" The UK will need to recruit thousands more bureaucrats to manage Brexit, according to a former diplomat. Sir Simon Fraser said the UK will need to ""scale up"" its civil service to handle the extra workload created by leaving the EU. The UK is currently negotiating its exit from the EU, and the government has said it will leave the single market and customs union. This will mean that the UK will have to create its own regulations for a range of areas, including trade, immigration, and environmental protection. Fraser said the UK will need to increase the size of its civil service to manage the extra workload. He said the UK will need to recruit ""thousands"" of new bureaucrats, and that the government should start recruiting now. ""I think we need to start planning for this now,"" he said. ""We need to start recruiting and training people now."" The government has said it is committed to reducing the size of the civil service, and has set a target of cutting 91,000 jobs by 2020. However, Fraser said the government will need to make an exception for Brexit. ""I think the government will have to make an exception for Brexit,"" he said. ""This is a one-off event, and we need to make sure that we have the resources in place to manage it."" The government has not said how many new bureaucrats it will need to recruit for Brexit.

Japan PM Abe condemns hostage 'death' video,"Shinzo Abe demanded the release of a second hostage, purported to be Kenji Goto, shown in the video. Japan says it is trying to verify. The prime minister described the apparent killing of Haruna Yukawa as ""an unforgivable act of terrorism, full of despicable brutality"". Abe added: ""Terrorism must never be tolerated and we must do our utmost to bring the terrorists responsible for this act to justice."" The video, released by Islamic State, purports to show the killing of Yukawa. Goto, a 47-year-old journalist, is threatened with a similar fate if demands, including a $200m (£130m) ransom, are not met within 72 hours. Islamic State had previously demanded the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a failed suicide bomber who is currently on death row in Jordan, in exchange for Goto and Yukawa. But Jordan said it would only release Rishawi if the militants provided proof that the Japanese hostages were still alive. US-led coalition aircraft continued to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. A senior coalition official said the strikes were part of a ""deliberate and measured"" campaign to shrink the area under Islamic State control. The official added that the campaign was ""not an effort to destroy or eliminate the group all at once"". Instead, the aim was to ""contain Islamic State, cut off its funding and foreign fighter flow, and support local forces as they take the fight to the terrorists"". The official said the coalition was also working to help Iraqis and Syrians in Islamic State-held areas. This included providing food, water, and medical care, as well as helping people escape from the group's control. It's important to note that the situation is fluid and could change rapidly.

Chinese firm set to buy House of Fraser,"Sanpower is expected to take an 89% share in the company, which would value the business at about £450m. The deal is expected to be announced as early as Tuesday, but a source close to the negotiations said it could slip into Wednesday. It is unclear what the deal means for the future of the business, which employs about 6,000 people in the UK and Ireland. House of Fraser has been struggling in recent years and has announced plans to close 31 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The company has been under pressure from its lenders to find a buyer, and Sanpower is thought to be the only party to have made a formal offer. Sanpower is a Chinese conglomerate with interests in a range of sectors, including retail, property and finance. It is thought to be keen to expand its presence in the UK, and the purchase of House of Fraser would give it a significant foothold in the country's retail sector. However, the deal is likely to raise concerns about the future of House of Fraser's workforce. Sanpower has a history of cost-cutting, and it is thought that it could seek to reduce the number of jobs at House of Fraser in order to improve profitability. The news of the deal comes at a time of uncertainty for the UK retail sector. A number of high-profile retailers have gone into administration in recent months, and the industry is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs and competition from online retailers. It is unclear whether Sanpower's purchase of House of Fraser will be enough to save the business, but it is hoped that the deal will provide some stability and allow the company to focus on its long-term future.

Easyjet wants more women in the cockpit,"By Rebecca Marston Business reporter, BBC News The Amy Johnson initiative, named after the first female pilot to fly solo from the UK to Australia, prompted 1,200 applications from women - a quarter of the total. The airline wants to address the gender imbalance in the industry. Currently, only 5% of the world's commercial airline pilots are women. EasyJet has set a target of recruiting 200 female pilots by 2020. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said: ""We have a problem with gender diversity in our industry... ""We want to inspire the next generation of female pilots."" The airline has also launched its own programme to help women from under-represented backgrounds break into the industry. The scheme, called 'Women in the Cockpit', will provide mentoring, networking opportunities and financial support to women who want to become pilots. EasyJet's initiatives are part of a wider effort by the aviation industry to address the gender imbalance. In 2016, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) launched its 25by2025 campaign, which aims to increase the number of women in the air transport industry by 25% by 2025. The campaign has been endorsed by a number of airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and Delta Air Lines. Despite these efforts, the number of women in the aviation industry remains low. According to IATA, women make up only 2% of airline pilots and 3% of airline engineers. There are a number of reasons for the gender imbalance in the aviation industry. One reason is that women are under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Another reason is that the aviation industry has a long history of being a male-dominated environment. However, there is a growing recognition that the aviation industry needs to change. The industry is losing out on talent by not attracting more women. A more diverse workforce would also lead to a more balanced and inclusive workplace. The initiatives being taken by easyJet and other airlines are a step in the right direction. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender equality in the aviation industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ashya King 'not receiving chemotherapy',"By David Fenton Health correspondent, BBC South Today His father said he did not need it as the tumour was now ""in remission"". But a leading UK cancer expert has said, without chemotherapy, children's chances of survival could be reduced. Ashya King, five, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September 2013. He and his family travelled to Prague for proton beam therapy - a form of radiotherapy - amid a dispute over his treatment with Southampton Children's Hospital. Following the therapy, his father Brett said the tumour was in remission and Ashya would not undergo any further chemotherapy. But Professor Karol Sikora, an independent cancer expert, said not continuing chemotherapy risked a ""significant"" reduction in Ashya's chance of survival. ""We do know that for a brain tumour of this type, the risk of relapse is high - about 60 to 70%,"" he said. ""Therefore without chemotherapy the risk of dying is significantly increased. ""If the family interrupt the treatment, I would think that his chances of survival will be reduced because the most effective treatment for this type of cancer is chemotherapy."" However Ashya's father has defended his decision. Brett King said his son ""did not need"" chemotherapy and said: ""The tumour is in remission. It's gone."" He said the family's decision to refuse chemotherapy was based on ""all the information available"". ""There are various treatments for this particular tumour, some of which include chemotherapy and some of which don't,"" he said. ""All these treatments come with their own toxicities and risks. This treatment has been going on for quite a long time. Ashya's had over six months of treatment. Our family are looking forward to it being over."" Ashya was treated with chemotherapy in Southampton before he left the UK. Professor Sikora said the hospital would have ""sound reasons"" for recommending chemotherapy. ""It's difficult to understand why they have changed their mind,"" he said. ""I think they've been given a lot of incorrect information on the internet... about the potential side-effects of chemotherapy and the benefits of proton beam therapy."" A spokesman for Southampton Children's Hospital said: ""We have a duty of care to all our patients and will therefore continue to take the necessary steps to ensure Ashya receives all the treatment recommended by his doctors.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Google v Oracle: Supreme Court declares Google's code copying fair,"Oracle, another tech titan, had sued Google in 2010 for copyright infringement over what it said was copied computer code. Android is now used in an estimated 70% of the world's smartphones, so even a small percentage of licensing fees would have amounted to billions of dollars. The Supreme Court decision was a victory for Google, but it could have implications for other copyright cases involving software and technology. It could also make it harder for companies to sue each other for copyright infringement. The court's decision was based on a fair use doctrine, which allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. The court found that Google's use of Oracle's code was a fair use because it was transformative, meaning that it created a new and different work that did not compete with Oracle's original work. The court also found that Google's use of Oracle's code was not commercial, even though Android is a commercial product. The court said that Google did not use Oracle's code to make a profit, but rather to create a new and innovative operating system. The Supreme Court's decision is a significant victory for Google and other companies that use copyrighted material in their products. It could make it easier for companies to defend themselves against copyright infringement lawsuits, and it could also lead to more innovation in the technology industry. However, the decision is also likely to be controversial. Some copyright holders may argue that it makes it too easy for companies to use their work without permission. The decision could also lead to more litigation, as companies try to determine what uses of copyrighted material are fair and what uses are not. Despite the potential for controversy, the Supreme Court's decision is a significant development in copyright law. It could have a major impact on the way that companies use copyrighted material in their products, and it could also lead to more innovation in the technology industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sri Lankan rights campaigner Jayalath Jayawardena dies,"By Charles Haviland BBC News, Colombo He had a recent history of heart disease. Dr Jayawardena was a stalwart of the main opposition United National Party. He became well-known for his staunch defence of basic freedoms under both Mr Rajapaksa's presidency and its successor, led by Maithripala Sirisena. Mr Sirisena appointed Dr Jayawardena to head the Human Rights Commission, a role he had held since 2016. However, the government faced criticism for alleged inaction on human rights, and the commission was accused of failing to investigate properly allegations of abuse. In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Dr Jayawardena said: ""The government has appointed me. I'm not accountable to any political party. People can criticise me as much as they want. I have a job to do."" He also argued that Sri Lanka's human rights record had ""vastly improved"" since the end of the war. ""The Rajapaksa regime considered any form of dissent as terrorism - and cracked down heavily. There's been a complete change when you compare that to what happened in the past,"" he said. However, he continued to criticise what he saw as a lack of accountability for war crimes committed during the final stages of the conflict. In 2019, he said that Sri Lanka was not cooperating fully with an international investigation into alleged human rights abuses during the war. Dr Jayawardena was born in Colombo in 1947 and studied in the UK at Oxford University. He worked as an academic and a human rights lawyer before entering politics. He joined the United National Party in 1994 and was elected to parliament two years later. He held several ministerial posts in the governments of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Dr Jayawardena was a strong advocate for a negotiated settlement to the Sri Lankan civil war, which ended in 2009. He also played a key role in the drafting of the country's new constitution, which was passed in 2017. News of Dr Jayawardena's death has been met with an outpouring of grief from across the political spectrum. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said in a statement that Dr Jayawardena had served the country with ""dedication and commitment"". Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said Dr Jayawardena was a ""true champion of human rights"". The UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, said Dr Jayawardena was ""an advocate for human dignity and rights"". ""His principled leadership will be deeply missed,"" she said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Alexander Vindman, witness 'bullied by Trump', quits US military","Lt Col Alexander Vindman was the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president, his lawyer said. Lt Col Vindman's ""concern"" over a phone call between Mr Trump and Ukraine's president led to his removal from his White House role last year and he quit the US military on Wednesday. In a statement his lawyer said he had been subjected to ""false attacks"" and ""innuendo"" since he testified to Congress about the call. He said Lt Col Vindman had ""honourably served this country"" and was ""forced out because he was inconvenient to the president"". The White House has denied the claims. Lt Col Vindman, who was born in Ukraine, was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump. He testified that he had been concerned about the president's request that Ukraine investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. After his testimony, Mr Trump called Lt Col Vindman a ""Never Trumper"" and suggested he had dual loyalties. Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said the president's attacks had taken a toll on his client. ""Lt Col Vindman has been the subject of relentless, unfounded attacks by the President of the United States,"" he said. ""These attacks have caused significant harm to his career and reputation, and have created a hostile work environment for him."" He said Lt Col Vindman had ""honourably served this country"" and was ""forced out because he was inconvenient to the president"". The White House has denied the claims. Lt Col Vindman's resignation comes as Mr Trump is facing a new impeachment inquiry, this time over allegations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden.

Birmingham stabbings: Family tribute to Jacob Billington,"Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street in the early hours of Sunday while he was out with old school friends, police said. He was rushed to hospital but died a short time later. His family spoke of their devastation in a statement released through West Midlands Police. They said: ""We are all absolutely devastated by Jacob's death. He was a loving son, brother, grandson and friend and his life has been cruelly cut short. ""He was out with his friends enjoying himself when he was attacked. We cannot understand why anyone would want to harm him. ""Jacob was a gentle and kind-hearted young man who had his whole life ahead of him. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him."" A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody. Detective Inspector Laura Harrison, from West Midlands Police's homicide unit, said: ""This was a senseless and tragic attack on a young man who was simply enjoying a night out with his friends. ""Our thoughts are with Jacob's family and friends at this difficult time. We are determined to find out who is responsible for his death and bring them to justice."" Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands Police via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk, via 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Knife crime has been a major issue in Birmingham in recent years. In 2021, there were 12 fatal stabbings in the city, the highest number in a decade. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster, has said that tackling knife crime is a ""top priority"" for the force. He said: ""Knife crime is a scourge on our communities and we are determined to do everything we can to tackle it. ""We are working closely with the police, schools and community groups to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime and to provide support to those who are at risk of being involved in it."" The government has also pledged to take action on knife crime. In 2021, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, announced a £30 million fund to tackle knife crime in six cities, including Birmingham. The fund will be used to provide support for young people who are at risk of being involved in knife crime, and to provide more resources for the police to tackle knife crime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Slovakian 'slave' trafficked to Burnley for marriage,"The Romany victim's account of being handled as a ""human slave"" read like ""something from a 19th century novel by Dickens"", Preston Crown Court heard. She described being trafficked from Slovakia to the UK at the age of 20, under the false promise of a job as a cleaner. Upon arriving in Burnley, she was forced into a sham marriage with a local man, who then subjected her to years of violence and exploitation. The victim testified that she was treated like a ""possession,"" with her movements and communication strictly controlled. She was forced to clean the house, cook the meals, and perform sexual acts on demand. Any attempts to resist were met with severe beatings and threats of violence. ""I was like a prisoner in my own home,"" she told the court. ""I couldn't go anywhere or speak to anyone without his permission. I was terrified of him."" The victim's ordeal only ended when she managed to escape and seek help from the police. Her trafficker, a 37-year-old man from Burnley, was subsequently arrested and charged with modern slavery, rape, and false imprisonment. Prosecutor Lisa Worsley told the court that the case highlighted the ""hidden and insidious"" nature of modern slavery in the UK. She said that victims are often isolated and vulnerable, and may be reluctant to come forward for fear of reprisals. ""This case is a reminder that slavery is not just something that happens in far-off countries,"" she said. ""It can happen anywhere, even in our own communities."" The victim's testimony has had a profound impact on the jury, who have heard harrowing details of her suffering.

UK to Zuckerberg: Show us you're sincere about regulation,"Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJon Twitter But now the UK's information commissioner has asked him to take action to show he means what he says. Elizabeth Denham has told Facebook to drop its appeal against the £500,000 ($655,000) fine she imposed for failing to protect the data of people who used the This is My Digital Life app. She said the public would struggle to trust Facebook's commitment to privacy and transparency if it continued to challenge the fine. ""The ICO [Information Commissioner's Office] wants to see Facebook put its words into action. There needs to be a meaningful shift in Facebook's privacy and data protection practices so that people are empowered and protected,"" she said. ""To create that shift, we expect Facebook to drop its appeal with immediate effect and start engaging meaningfully to bring its practices in line with the law."" So far, Facebook has given no indication that it intends to drop its appeal. In fact, it issued a statement suggesting that it was even less willing to change its privacy policies. The company said that while it shared the ICO's goal to protect people's data, it had ""fundamentally disagreed with the ICO's approach"" to the case. ""We believe the ICO's investigation and decision in this case was flawed, and we intend to appeal,"" it said. ""We appreciate the ICO's recognition that protecting privacy and data is important and share that goal, but we believe the ICO's investigation and decision in this case was flawed and we intend to appeal."" If it does lose the appeal, the company could face a fine of up to 4% of its global turnover - or about £1.5bn. But there are many people who question whether even this would be enough to force the company to change its ways. ""Facebook is an unstoppable juggernaut that is out of control and Mark Zuckerberg will do nothing to change that, no matter how much money he is fined,"" said Julian McQuillan, a security researcher who is now chief executive of security firm Tenable.

Danielle McLaughlin 'raped and strangled' - post mortem,"Danielle McLaughlin, from County Donegal, was found dead in a field close to tourist resorts in Canacona on Tuesday morning. The 28-year-old had travelled to India in February. Her post mortem concluded that brain damage and asphyxia caused her death. A man arrested on Wednesday in connection with the murder of McLaughlin has admitted to having sex with her but denied killing her, his lawyer said. Vikat Bhagat was arrested in the coastal state of Goa after police said that DNA evidence linked him to the crime. McLaughlin's body was found with multiple injuries, including a head wound, and DNA samples were taken from her body. Police said that Bhagat's DNA matched samples taken from her body. Bhagat's lawyer, Amit Palyekar, said that his client admitted to having sex with McLaughlin but denied killing her. He said that Bhagat had been drinking heavily on the night of the murder and could not remember what happened. ""He has admitted to having consensual sex with the girl,"" Palyekar said. ""He does not remember what happened after that because he was heavily drunk."" Palyekar said that Bhagat had been cooperating with police and had given them a DNA sample. He said that his client was ""innocent until proven guilty"" and that he would fight the charges against him. The murder of McLaughlin has shocked the local community in Goa and has raised concerns about the safety of foreign tourists in the state. Goa is a popular tourist destination, known for its beaches and nightlife. McLaughlin's family has said that they are ""devastated"" by her death and have called for justice. They have said that they want the person responsible for her murder to be brought to justice. The Irish government has said that it is ""deeply concerned"" about the murder of McLaughlin and has called on the Indian government to investigate the case thoroughly.

"UK fracking: Shale gas starts flowing, Cuadrilla says","Operations began at the Lancashire site in October for the first time since 2011 when it was suspended because of earth tremors. Cuadrilla said that the gas that was produced will be flared off on site rather than sold commercially. The firm said this was ""to ensure both operational efficiency and to provide technical information"". It said the gas was expected to flow for about four weeks. Cuadrilla is the only company to have fracked in the UK, but was forced to suspend its operations in 2011 and 2019 after seismic activity was recorded. Fracking - a technique to extract gas or oil from underground - has been a source of controversy in the UK, with many environmental groups opposed to the process. Critics say it can cause environmental damage, including water contamination and air pollution. They also argue that it is not a sustainable source of energy because it contributes to climate change. The government has said fracking will only be allowed if it can be done safely, but has not ruled out supporting the industry in the future. Cuadrilla has always maintained that fracking is safe and can be done without causing environmental harm. The company said in a statement that it was ""delighted"" to have started producing gas from the Lancashire site. ""This is a significant milestone for Cuadrilla and for the UK shale gas industry,"" the statement said. ""We are now focused on continuing to operate safely and efficiently, and on providing valuable technical information that will help to inform the wider debate about shale gas in the UK."" Anti-fracking campaigners have vowed to continue to oppose the industry. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Danny Gross said: ""This is a dangerous and unnecessary step backwards. Fracking is a dirty and risky technique that has no place in the UK. ""The government must now abandon its support for fracking and focus on investing in clean, renewable energy sources.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Tax power restrictions 'starting point' for debate, says Cameron","UK ministers want to hold a referendum on allowing the Welsh government to vary income tax rates. Each income tax band could only be moved at the same time and by the same amount. For example, if the basic rate of income tax in Wales is 10%, the government could increase or decrease it by 1%, 2%, or any other single figure - but not by different amounts for different bands. Under the plans, the Welsh government would not be able to set a different threshold at which people start paying income tax. Many people have said they would support the move if it was put to a referendum. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, said it would support a referendum on giving the Welsh government the power to set income tax. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, said: ""I think the people of Wales are grown up and have shown in recent referendums that they are capable of taking big decisions."" The Welsh Conservatives have also said they would support the move. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""This is something that we have been calling for for a long time. We believe that the people of Wales should have the power to set their own taxes."" However, some people have said they are concerned about the impact that the move could have on the UK's economy. The UK Treasury has said that it is concerned about the impact that the move could have on the UK's single market. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We are concerned about the potential impact on the UK's single market, and on the competitiveness of the UK economy."" The Welsh government has said that it is confident that the move would not have a negative impact on the UK economy.

Tesco to fight dairy price-fixing fine from OFT,"The supermarket giant was one of nine firms facing penalties totalling close to £50m for colluding over the price of milk and cheese in 2002 and 2003. But Tesco expressed ""surprise and dismay"" at the findings, saying it ""fundamentally disagrees"" with the decision and intends to appeal. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) accused Tesco of discussing and agreeing price increases with other UK supermarkets, including Asda, Sainsbury's and Safeway. The investigation focused on price discussions that took place at a series of meetings that were allegedly organised by former dairy industry executive Robert Wiseman. The OFT said the meetings ""created a climate in which it was easier for the supermarkets to implement the price increases, and to deter customers from switching between the supermarkets"". The investigation also found that the supermarkets exchanged commercially sensitive information, such as details of their pricing plans. The OFT imposed fines totalling £49.5m on the nine companies involved. Tesco was fined £10.3m, the largest penalty. Other companies fined included Dairy Crest (£8.7m), Arla Foods (£6.3m) and Lactalis Nestle (£3.9m). Tesco said it ""acted in the best interests of customers"" and that it ""did not engage in any anti-competitive behaviour"". The company said it would ""vigorously defend"" its position in court. The other eight companies fined by the OFT have not yet commented on the decision. The OFT's investigation into dairy price-fixing is not the first time that the supermarket industry has been accused of anti-competitive behaviour. In 2002, the Competition Commission found that the four major UK supermarkets were operating a cartel in relation to the supply of fuel. The Competition Commission imposed fines totalling £252m on the four companies. The OFT's dairy price-fixing investigation is a reminder of the importance of competition in the food industry. Competition helps to keep prices low and encourages innovation. The OFT's findings suggest that the UK supermarket industry is not as competitive as it could be. The OFT's investigation may lead to changes in the way that supermarkets operate, which could benefit consumers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Google's Street View faces multi-state US probe,"It is the latest in a series of global investigations aimed at the firm. Google has admitted that its Street View cars ""accidentally"" collected data from unsecured wi-fi networks in 30 countries because of some rogue code in the company's software. The probes are looking into whether the data collection breached privacy laws and whether the company misled regulators. In the US, the investigation is being led by the attorneys general of seven states: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. They have asked Google to provide a range of documents, including records about the data collection process, the security measures that were in place and the communications between Google and its employees about the issue. Germany has already fined Google €145,000 (£107,000; $161,000) over the issue. The city of Hamburg has also banned Street View cars from operating in the area because of concerns about privacy. In June, Google agreed to pay £18m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by UK citizens over the Street View data collection. The company has since taken steps to tighten its privacy controls and has said that it is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. However, the latest investigations show that regulators are still concerned about the company's data collection practices. The probes are likely to take several months to complete. If any of the states find that Google has breached the law, they could impose fines or other penalties. Google has said that it is cooperating with the investigations and that it is confident that it has not broken any laws. However, the investigations could damage the company's reputation and make it harder to convince people to share their personal information with Google. The probes also come at a time when Google is facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. The European Commission is investigating Google's search practices, while the US Federal Trade Commission is looking into the company's advertising practices. The investigations show that regulators are increasingly concerned about the power of large technology companies and their ability to collect and use personal data.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sellafield partly closed after 'above normal' radiation,"Each building was checked after a perimeter alarm was triggered at the north of the site. The company later said it was naturally occurring background radiation and not a nuclear leak. A spokesman added: ""Our priority is the safety of our workforce and the protection of the environment. We take all radiation alarms seriously and investigate them thoroughly. ""We are confident that there has been no release of radioactive material from the site."" The alarm was triggered at around 08:30 BST on Saturday. The site was partly closed as a precaution, with only essential staff allowed on the northern part of the site. The Environment Agency said it was monitoring the situation and had no concerns about any impact on the public or the environment. Sellafield is one of the UK's most hazardous nuclear sites. It is home to a number of nuclear reactors and reprocessing facilities. In 2005, a major fire broke out at the site, which led to the release of radioactive material. The fire caused widespread public concern and led to a number of investigations. The site has been subject to a number of safety upgrades since the fire, including the installation of new fire detection and suppression systems. The latest incident is a reminder of the potential risks associated with nuclear power. However, Sellafield's operator, Sellafield Ltd, said it was confident that the site was safe. A spokesman said: ""We have a robust safety culture and we are committed to operating the site safely and securely.""

Tamboran: Licence for fracking plans terminated,"Tamboran was granted a petroleum licence in 2011. It had three years to inform the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on its work programme and drilling schedule. Tamboran was unable to do this in the agreed timescale. DETI subsequently served several late submission notices on the company. In a statement, Tamboran Resources UK Ltd said that while the company ""fundamentally disagrees with the decision"" it would ""comply fully"" with the government's decision. The company said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision as it had submitted ""a robust plan to undertake exploration drilling"". ""The company believes that the proposed exploration drilling programme would have been in accordance with the terms of the licence and Northern Ireland legislation and would have been carried out safely and responsibly,"" the statement continued. Tamboran also said that it had ""confidence in the safety and regulation of onshore oil and gas exploration and drilling in the UK"". In a statement, DETI said that the licence had been terminated ""in accordance with the relevant legislation and after careful consideration of all available information"". The department said that it ""recognises the potential economic benefits of oil and gas exploration and production in Northern Ireland"". However, it added that ""the safety of our environment and the wellbeing of our communities must be paramount"". DETI said it would ""continue to engage with stakeholders on the future of onshore oil and gas exploration and production in Northern Ireland"". The decision to terminate Tamboran's licence is likely to be welcomed by environmental groups. Friends of the Earth Northern Ireland said that the decision was a ""victory for common sense and the environment"". ""This decision sends a clear message that fracking will not be tolerated in Northern Ireland,"" the group said in a statement. Greenpeace also welcomed the decision, saying that it was a ""major victory for the people of Northern Ireland"". ""This decision is a testament to the power of people power,"" the group said in a statement. The decision is also likely to be welcomed by some local residents. Many people in the area where Tamboran was planning to drill have expressed concerns about the potential impact of fracking on their health and the environment. A petition against fracking in Northern Ireland has been signed by more than 50,000 people.

"North Korea access to outside media up, says US study","The government was unable to maintain a ""total monopoly"" over information and the people's ""understanding of the world is changing"", the report by InterMedia, a Washington-based research group, concluded. The report found that access to outside information in North Korea has increased significantly over the last few years, thanks to the widespread use of mobile phones and USB flash drives. This has opened up a new window to the outside world for North Koreans, who are now able to access a wider range of information than ever before. The report found that the North Korean government is aware of the increasing access to outside information and is trying to crack down on it. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful, and access to outside information continues to grow. The report's findings are based on a survey of North Korean defectors who have recently arrived in South Korea. The defectors were asked about their access to outside information, and their responses were used to estimate the overall level of access to outside information in North Korea. The report's findings are significant because they suggest that the North Korean government is losing its grip on the information environment. This is a major development, and it could have a profound impact on the future of North Korea. If the North Korean people continue to gain access to outside information, they will become more aware of the outside world and the possibilities that exist beyond their borders. This could lead to a growing demand for change, and it could eventually lead to the downfall of the North Korean government. The report's findings are a reminder that the world is changing, and that even the most repressive regimes cannot completely control the flow of information. The North Korean government may be able to block access to certain websites and social media platforms, but it cannot stop the flow of information altogether. The North Korean people are now more connected to the outside world than ever before, and this is having a profound impact on their lives. They are becoming more aware of the outside world and the possibilities that exist beyond their borders. This could lead to a growing demand for change, and it could eventually lead to the downfall of the North Korean government.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Windrush scandal: Compensation could be capped under proposed scheme,"Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high amount"" compared to others who had been wronged. The department also insisted it planned to make the scheme ""as simple and straightforward as possible"". However, while the Home Office has proposed a minimum payment of £10,000 for each person who was unlawfully detained or deported, the proposed maximum compensation is yet to be set. Campaigners have said that a cap of £100,000 would not be acceptable as many people had lost much more than that as a result of the scandal. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, described the consultation as ""a complete insult to the victims"". ""The Windrush scandal is one of the most shameful episodes in recent British history and the victims deserve much more than what is being offered,"" she said. ""A cap of £100,000 is completely inadequate. Many victims have lost their jobs, their homes, and their health as a result of this scandal. They deserve to be properly compensated."" The Windrush generation refers to people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971 to help rebuild the country after World War Two. Many were children at the time and had no idea they did not have the right documentation to be in the UK. The scandal erupted in 2018 when it emerged that some members of the Windrush generation had been wrongly detained and deported, while others had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The government has since apologized for the scandal and set up a compensation scheme. However, the details of the scheme have been criticized by campaigners who say it does not go far enough. The Home Office said the consultation would give victims and their representatives the opportunity to have their say on the design of the scheme.

Greene King Black Boy pubs renamed in 'anti-racist' move,"Greene King has changed the names of three pubs called The Black Boy, and another called The Black's Head. Managing director Wayne Shurvinton said there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism"". The pubs have been renamed The Black Horse, The White Hart, The Coach and Horses, and The Duck. Shurvinton said the decision was made after ""listening to feedback from our customers and local communities"". He added: ""We want our pubs to be welcoming and inclusive spaces where everyone can enjoy themselves. We believe that changing the names of these pubs is an important step in making that happen."" The move comes amid a wider debate about the use of racially insensitive language and imagery in the UK. In recent months, several statues of historical figures with links to slavery have been toppled or removed. Greene King's decision has been welcomed by some anti-racism campaigners. ""This is a positive step forward,"" said Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote. ""The names of these pubs were offensive and had no place in our society. Changing them is a sign that we are moving in the right direction."" However, others have expressed concerns about the move. ""This is a knee-jerk reaction to a very small minority of people who are trying to rewrite history,"" said historian David Starkey. ""The names of these pubs have been around for centuries and they do not have any racist connotations."" Greene King is one of the largest pub chains in the UK, with over 2,700 pubs. The company has said that it will continue to review the names of its pubs and make changes where necessary. In addition to the four pubs that have been renamed, Greene King also plans to change the name of a pub called The Black Boy in Nottingham. The company has said that it will work with local historians to find a new name for the pub that is ""appropriate and respectful"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"France: More than 2,500 break virus restrictions at illegal rave","Some of the 2,500 ravers in Lieuron near Rennes in Brittany had planned to party until Tuesday. Police issued fines to revellers found leaving and the organisers were being identified as the party ended. Around 1,500 police officers had been deployed to disperse the crowds, with reinforcements from as far away as Paris and other cities. They used drones, tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to break up the party. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the illegal rave was a ""serious threat to public order"" and that the police had acted ""firmly but fairly"". He said that the party had been planned for weeks and that the organisers had expected up to 5,000 people to attend. The rave was held in a field near a small town, with stages and sound systems set up for the revellers. The party-goers were mostly young people, many of them from the Paris region. The illegal rave in Lieuron is the latest in a series of similar events that have taken place in France in recent months. In June, a rave in the north-eastern city of Metz was attended by over 3,000 people and lasted for several days. The French government has condemned these illegal raves and vowed to crack down on them. In July, the government announced new measures to prevent and punish illegal raves, including increased fines and prison sentences for organisers. However, some rave organisers say that the government's crackdown is unfair and that they are simply providing a space for young people to express themselves and have fun. They say that the government should focus on providing more legal and safe places for young people to party. The debate over illegal raves is likely to continue in France, as the government tries to balance the need to maintain public order with the right of young people to enjoy themselves.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cardiff Airport to get loan fund of up to £13m to attract new airlines,"The first £3.5m of the loan, from the Welsh government, will be drawn down by the airport next year. Welsh ministers have described the loan as the most significant step since they bought the airport 18 months ago. The rest of the money will come from commercial lenders. The airport hopes to use the loan to attract new airlines and increase passenger numbers. Cardiff Airport has been struggling in recent years, with passenger numbers falling. The airport has been losing money and has had to cut staff. The Welsh government hopes that the loan will help to turn around the airport's fortunes. The government believes that the airport is vital to the Welsh economy. The loan will be used to fund a number of projects at the airport, including: A new terminal building A new runway A new control tower A new baggage handling system A new car park The airport is also planning to launch a new marketing campaign to attract new airlines. The Welsh government has said that it is confident that the loan will be a success. The government believes that the airport has the potential to be a major economic driver for Wales.

HIV flushed out by cancer drug,"By James Gallagher Health and science reporter, BBC News website The cornerstone of treatment, anti-retroviral therapy, kills the virus in the bloodstream but leaves ""HIV reservoirs"" untouched. The study, published in PLoS Pathogens, showed the drug Vorinostat flushed out some of these reservoirs in the blood. Researchers say it is still early days, but this suggests a combination of cancer and HIV treatments could one day lead to a cure. HIV has a unique ability to evade the immune system - it hides its genetic material inside the DNA of immune cells. When an immune cell is activated to fight an infection, the latent HIV emerges to produce new virus particles. Finding and destroying these reservoirs is crucial for a cure for HIV. Dr Paul Bieniasz, from the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, who led the study, said: ""Most people believe that HIV cannot be cured with current therapies because of these latent reservoirs. ""And because they are latent, they don't present a target to the immune system or to anti-retroviral therapy."" His team treated HIV-infected human cells with Vorinostat for four days. Most of the virus remained hidden, but some of the dormant HIV was exposed. ""It's only a modest effect,"" he said. ""But it's an important proof-of-concept study that this type of approach might have promise."" Dr Bieniasz said the next step would be to see if the drug has the same effect in animal models of HIV. And he said it was possible HIV-infected people who needed Vorinostat for their cancer could benefit from this side-effect. Dr Sarah Fidler, a HIV cure researcher at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were ""an interesting proof-of-concept"". She said: ""If this strategy could be translated to HIV patients, it could be used either to reduce reservoirs at the start of treatment to enhance standard therapy, as a strategy to eliminate reservoirs after the virus has been reduced to very low levels, or to enhance immune-based strategies where the aim is to kill infected cells."" She added: ""There will still be challenges to overcome, such as trying to identify the right time to administer the drug, and considering the side-effects or interactions with HIV drugs or treatments for other conditions.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts,"Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts The Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd was taken over by a limited company and charity after it closed in 2014. A statement on its Facebook page said it closed its doors on Saturday. A post on its social media page said: ""It is with great sadness that we have to announce the closure of The Muni Arts Centre. ""As a board of trustees and staff, we have worked tirelessly in recent years to address these significant financial challenges and have been exploring all possible options to keep the centre open. ""However, despite these efforts, we have been unable to secure the funding necessary to continue operating the venue and have had to take the difficult decision to close."" The Muni Arts Centre was built in 1910 as a public library and became a popular venue for music, theatre and dance in the 1970s and 1980s. The centre played a key role in the cultural life of Pontypridd, but it closed in 2014 due to financial difficulties. The Muni Arts Centre was taken over by a limited company and charity in 2015. The new owners had hoped to reopen the centre in 2016 but were unable to secure the necessary funding. The closure of the Muni Arts Centre is a major blow to the cultural life of Pontypridd. The venue played an important role in the community, providing a space for people to enjoy music, theatre and dance.

Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis' death 'caused by heading balls',"Alan Jarvis played for Everton and Hull City in the 1960s and 1970s, winning three caps for his country. The 76-year-old, who died in March, was diagnosed with dementia in 2016. A coroner ruled that heading footballs during his playing days ""more than likely"" caused the brain damage which led to Jarvis developing the condition. Professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than the general population and there is a growing concern about the long-term effects of heading the ball. Experts believe it could be linked to the repetitive heading of the ball causing small amounts of trauma to the brain. However, they say more research is needed to establish a definitive link between the two. The Football Association (FA) said it was ""committed to improving the understanding of the long-term health of former players"" and was funding research into the issue. In a statement, the FA said: ""The FA is committed to improving the understanding of the long-term health of former players and is funding research into the issue. ""We are aware of the concerns that have been raised about the potential risks of heading the ball and are committed to working with other organisations to help protect players."" The FA has introduced a number of measures to try to reduce the risk of heading the ball, including limiting the number of headers that players can do in training and introducing a ban on heading for children under the age of 12. It is hoped that these measures will help to protect future generations of players from the risk of developing dementia. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the long-term effects of heading the ball. More research is needed to establish a definitive link between the two and to determine whether the measures that are being introduced are effective in reducing the risk of dementia.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Australian casino shares tumble after China arrests,"Crown Resorts, controlled by James Packer, closed 13.9% lower after Crown confirmed 18 of its staff had been detained in China. Among those arrested was a senior executive in charge of international high-roller operations, Jason O'Connor. Crown said the arrests were related to an investigation by Chinese authorities into ""an alleged offence of promoting gambling"". The company said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the arrests and was providing consular support to its staff. The arrests come at a time when the Chinese government is cracking down on gambling and money laundering. In recent months, Chinese authorities have detained several executives from other casino operators, including Star Entertainment Group and the former head of Macau's gaming regulator, Alvin Chau. Analysts said the arrests could have a significant impact on Crown's business in China. Crown generates around 20% of its revenue from China, and it has been investing heavily in the country in recent years. ""The arrests are a major blow to Crown's China ambitions,"" said David Bain, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""Crown has been targeting high-rollers from China, and these arrests will make it much more difficult for the company to attract these customers."" The arrests also come at a time when Crown is facing other challenges. The company is currently under investigation by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) for alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Crown is also facing a class action lawsuit from shareholders who allege that the company misled them about its compliance with anti-money laundering laws. The combination of these challenges has put pressure on Crown's share price. Crown's shares have fallen by more than 30% in the past year. Analysts said the arrests in China could further damage Crown's share price. ""The arrests could lead to a sell-off in Crown shares, as investors become increasingly concerned about the company's exposure to China,"" said Bain.

Google hit with €1.5bn fine from EU over advertising,"It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. Google has previously faced EU antitrust fines of €2.4bn in 2017 and €4.3bn in 2018. The company said it would appeal the latest fine. ""We will appeal this decision,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""The decision ignores our investments in Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" The European Commission said Google's conduct had ""denied consumers a genuine choice of mobile search apps and services and stifled innovation in the mobile advertising market"". ""Google has cemented its dominance in general search in the vast majority of member states through various practices,"" commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. ""It has also used Android as a vehicle to consolidate its dominance in search via mobile devices."" Vestager said the fine was ""proportionate and dissuasive"". The case relates to agreements between Google and mobile network operators and device manufacturers. The commission said the agreements included clauses that required the pre-installation of Google's search app on Android devices and prevented manufacturers from developing and distributing competing apps. The commission said Google also prevented rivals from accessing key information needed to develop competing search apps. Google denied the allegations, arguing that its agreements with partners were ""pro-competitive"". The company said its partners were free to choose any search provider they wanted. Google also pointed to the large number of competing search apps available on Android devices.

Wales child abuse: 38 calls to children's commissioner,"Keith Towler said some were from people wanting to make ""fresh allegations"", and he would welcome further calls. Details of abuse, centred on children's homes in north Wales, began to emerge in the 1990s leading to the Clwyd inquiry, which reported in 2002. A later inquiry, the Waterhouse inquiry, reported in 2000 on allegations of abuse in children's homes in north Wales. Mr Towler said an inquiry must be independent and explore all aspects of child abuse, but he said a narrow inquiry may not be the best approach. He said: ""I feel very strongly that we should be talking about a broader inquiry and we should not be excluding, for example, the churches, [or] local authorities."" He was also asked if abuse continues to this day, and he replied: ""I cannot say for sure because I haven't got the information available to me. But what I would say is that there is a danger that there are still some people who are working with children who shouldn't be."" A statement from the Welsh government said: ""The First Minister has asked the Children and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales (CSSIW) to complete a review of safeguarding and governance around residential child care in north Wales by the end of the financial year. ""The CSSIW will also be asked to look into ways to improve reporting across organisations and agencies on safeguarding matters, including the role of the commissioner for children."" In a statement, the Commissioner for Children for Wales said child sexual abuse is a ""scourge on society"" and that the individuals involved should be ""thoroughly investigated"". The commissioner said: ""We need to take action now to protect children and young people from further abuse.

""It's a period in history I'm very intrigued by,"" said Pine. ""I think historically Robert the Bruce was one of the greatest warriors and greatest heroes of Scotland. ""His story is one of rebellion and kind of triumph over tyranny and I think is still such a moving and exciting story today."" Pine said he was attracted to the role as it allowed him to explore the idea of heroism. ""I always like to think that heroism isn't just about the individual,"" he said. ""It's about a community coming together. The sum of all the parts creates a heroic whole."" He added: ""There are so many different kinds of heroes, from those who stand up for what they believe in to those who are just trying to make a better life for their family.

Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam',"By Chris Baraniuk Technology reporter In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" that led to the theft of £79 million. An investigation by the BBC has discovered that the targets of the attack were Google and Facebook's parent company, Meta. The attack saw the fraudster pose as a representative of a Taiwanese hardware manufacturer and send emails to staff at Meta and Google. The emails contained links to a malicious website that looked like a genuine login page for the companies' email systems. Staff at Meta and Google were tricked into entering their usernames and passwords into this fake website. The fraudster then used this information to log in to Meta and Google's email systems and send out requests for payments to fraudulent bank accounts. In some cases, the fraudster also used the compromised email accounts to send out phishing emails to the companies' customers, in an attempt to steal their personal data. Meta and Google have not publicly confirmed that they were the targets of this attack, but a source close to the investigation has confirmed the BBC's findings. The attack is a reminder of the importance of being vigilant against phishing attacks. Phishing emails often look very genuine, but there are some tell-tale signs to watch out for. For example, phishing emails often: - Use generic greetings, such as ""Dear Valued Customer"" or ""Dear Sir/Madam"". - Contain spelling and grammar errors. - Ask you to click on a link to a website that you don't recognise. - Ask you to enter your personal information, such as your username, password, or credit card number. If you receive an email that you think may be a phishing email, do not click on any links or open any attachments. Forward the email to your company's IT department or to a dedicated phishing reporting service. You can also report phishing emails to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at report@phishing.gov.uk.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
US Senate passes sanctions on Iran central bank,"The measures, passed by 100 votes to nil, would ban foreign firms from doing business with the Iranian central bank. Before it can become law, it must be approved by the House and President. The bill's supporters say it will cripple Iran's economy and force it to abandon its nuclear programme. However, critics argue that it will only harm the Iranian people and make it more difficult to resolve the nuclear issue through diplomacy. The Obama administration has not yet said whether it will support the bill. However, it has previously warned that new sanctions could make it more difficult to resolve the nuclear issue through diplomacy. The US and Iran have been locked in a standoff over Iran's nuclear programme for years. Iran insists that its programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US and its allies believe that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. In 2015, Iran and six world powers, including the US, reached a deal to limit Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. However, President Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Since then, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated. In January 2020, the US assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to retaliate by firing missiles at US forces in Iraq. The US has also imposed additional sanctions on Iran in an attempt to cripple its economy. However, Iran has refused to abandon its nuclear programme, and the standoff continues. The passage of the new sanctions bill by the US Senate is a further escalation of tensions between the two countries. It remains to be seen whether the bill will be approved by the House and the President, and whether it will have any impact on the nuclear standoff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UK ministers halt Scottish fracking ahead of Holyrood move,"UK ministers will, however, consult with companies which have already applied for licences before any final decision is made. New powers over the industry are due to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament in the coming months. Scottish ministers have welcomed the announcement, saying it provides ""certainty"" for communities and businesses. ""The Scottish Government has always been clear that we do not support fracking, and we are pleased that the UK Government has listened to our concerns,"" said a Scottish Government spokesperson. ""We will now work with the UK Government to ensure that the transition to a net-zero economy is fair and just for all."" The decision to halt fracking in Scotland has been met with mixed reactions from the industry. Some companies have welcomed the move, saying it provides clarity and certainty for their operations. Others have expressed disappointment, saying they believe fracking could have played a role in reducing the UK's reliance on foreign energy imports. The UK Government's decision to halt fracking in Scotland is a significant development in the debate over the future of the industry in the UK. It is likely to lead to increased pressure on the government to ban fracking in England and Wales. Fracking is a controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from shale rock. It involves drilling a well into the rock and then injecting water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure to fracture the rock and release the oil or gas. There are concerns that fracking can cause environmental damage, including water contamination and air pollution. There are also concerns that it can cause earthquakes. The Scottish Government has a long-standing opposition to fracking, and in 2015 it introduced a moratorium on the practice. The UK Government has previously supported fracking, but in recent months it has come under increasing pressure to ban the practice. The decision to halt fracking in Scotland is a major victory for environmental campaigners.

Hepatitis C vaccine: Oxford researchers' trial 'promising',"Designing a vaccine has been difficult as the virus changes its appearance, making it hard to find something to target. Writing in Science Translational Medicine, researchers say their vaccine targets all major strains of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The vaccine is made using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) – harmless viruses that can deliver genetic material into cells. It delivers genes encoding non-structural proteins (NS) of HCV, which are essential for viral replication and not targeted by current direct-acting antiviral drugs. They tested the vaccine in mice with liver disease and found that it produced high levels of antibodies and reduced levels of viral RNA in the liver. The findings were consistent across all strains of HCV tested, suggesting it could provide broad protection against the virus. They then tested the vaccine in non-human primates and found that it was safe and induced robust antibody responses. Dr Rebecca Spindler, of the University of Oxford, said: ""These results are very promising and suggest that this vaccine strategy could be used to prevent or treat HCV infection. We are now planning to start clinical trials in humans."" Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus that can cause liver damage, scarring and liver cancer. It is estimated to affect around 71 million people worldwide. The current standard of care for HCV is direct-acting antiviral drugs, which are highly effective at clearing the virus but can be expensive and have side effects. A vaccine would be a more cost-effective and convenient way to prevent HCV infection. The new vaccine is still in the early stages of development, but the results from the animal studies are promising. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective in humans, it could have a major impact on the global burden of HCV. In addition to developing a vaccine, researchers are also working on new treatments for HCV. One promising approach is gene editing, which could be used to cure the virus by removing it from the body. Clinical trials of gene editing for HCV are currently underway.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Her detention sparked international concern, with the US and the UN calling for her immediate release. Amnesty International said the charges against her were ""baseless"" and politically motivated. Gao has been a thorn in the side of the Chinese government for many years. In 1989, she was imprisoned for her reporting on the Tiananmen Square protests. After her release, she continued to write and comment on China's political system. In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on dissent, and Gao's imprisonment is seen as a further sign of this. Chinese state media has accused Gao of betraying her country and endangering national security. However, many believe that she is being punished for her independent journalism and her criticism of the government. The case has also raised concerns about the freedom of the press in China. In recent years, several other journalists have been detained or imprisoned for their work. In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Gao's imprisonment. The club said that ""the detention of Gao Yu is a clear signal that the Chinese government is determined to silence independent journalism"". The Chinese government has not commented on the international criticism of Gao's imprisonment. However, it is clear that the government is determined to crack down on dissent and to maintain its control over the media.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nearly 200 Wales carers 'had to give up jobs' to look after family,"By India Pollock BBC Wales social affairs correspondent Carers Wales found the figure amounted to just under half of the people it surveyed.

Chief executive of Carers Wales, Elaine Bennett, said: ""The research shows the huge impact that caring can have on people's lives. ""Many people are having to give up work or reduce their hours in order to care for a loved one. This can have a significant financial impact on families, as well as making it difficult for people to progress in their careers. ""We want to see the Welsh Government do more to support unpaid carers. This could include providing more financial assistance, more respite care, and more flexible working arrangements."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We know that unpaid carers make a huge contribution to our communities, and we are committed to supporting them. ""We provide a range of support to carers, including financial assistance, respite care, and information and advice. We are also working to improve the flexibility of working arrangements for carers.

Jack and Sophie most popular baby names in Scotland,"Other favourites for babies born in 2010 included Lewis for boys and Olivia for girls. The details, released by the Registrar General for Scotland, also showed Oliver and Jamie as new entrants in the top 10. ""This information is fascinating as it provides valuable insights into current trends and gives us a glimpse into what people are choosing to name their children,"" a spokesperson from the Registrar General for Scotland commented. Additionally, Noah, Elijah, Charlie, and Oscar continued to hold their places in the top 10 list of boys' names. Meanwhile, Isabella, Emily, Ava, and Isla remained consistent favourites for girls. The report also revealed that some traditional names have experienced a resurgence in popularity, such as Lachlan, which moved up 20 places in the rankings. Eilidh, a classic Gaelic name, also saw a surge in popularity, jumping from 15th to 10th place. The data also suggests that parents are increasingly opting for shorter, simpler names. Max, Jack, and Josh have become more common for boys, while Isla, Ava, and Mia have gained popularity among girls. The choice of baby names can be influenced by various factors, including personal preferences, cultural heritage, and even celebrity influences. It is interesting to observe how these trends evolve over time, reflecting the changing cultural landscape and societal values.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Regulator to investigate sale of online dating profiles,"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has said it will investigate the sale. The ICO said the sale of this information could be ""a significant personal data breach"". The regulator said it had become aware of claims that personal data from online dating profiles is being sold on the internet. The ICO said it was concerned that this data could be used for ""fraudulent or malicious"" purposes. ""The sale of personal data from online dating profiles could be a significant personal data breach,"" the ICO said in a statement. ""We are aware of these claims and we will be investigating them thoroughly."" The ICO said it was not yet clear how many people had been affected by the sale of their data. The regulator said it was working to establish the full extent of the breach. ""We will be working with the relevant organisations to establish the full extent of this breach and to take appropriate action,"" the ICO said. The ICO's investigation comes after a report by The Sunday Times newspaper claimed that the personal data of millions of people who have used online dating websites had been sold on the internet. The newspaper said the data included names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The report claimed that the data had been sold to a number of companies, including a company called Cybersitter. Cybersitter has denied any wrongdoing. The ICO said it was aware of the report in The Sunday Times and was taking it ""very seriously"". The regulator said it would be working with the relevant organisations to establish the full extent of the breach and to take appropriate action. The ICO's investigation is likely to focus on whether the companies involved in the sale of the data have breached the Data Protection Act 1998. The Act requires companies to take reasonable steps to protect the personal data they hold. If the ICO finds that the companies involved in the sale of the data have breached the Data Protection Act, it could take a number of enforcement actions, including issuing fines. The ICO's investigation is a reminder of the importance of protecting your personal data. When you provide your personal data to a company, you should make sure that you are confident that the company will take steps to protect your data.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Fewer cars' as London congestion charge zone cut back,"TfL said in the first three months of the year there was also a negligible impact on air quality and minimal change in traffic speeds in the area. The organisation said that overall, the ULEZ had not affected journey times for motorists, with many finding alternative routes or using public transport instead. However, some businesses in the affected areas have reported a drop in trade since the ULEZ was extended. A spokesperson for the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the expansion of the zone had been ""a blow"" to many small businesses, particularly those that rely on customers driving to their premises. ""We have heard from members who have seen a significant drop in footfall since the ULEZ was extended,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is particularly concerning for businesses that are already struggling in the current economic climate."" The spokesperson added that the chamber was calling on the Mayor of London to review the ULEZ and consider exemptions for certain types of businesses. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has defended the ULEZ, saying that it is necessary to improve air quality in the capital. He has also pointed to the fact that the ULEZ has been accompanied by a number of measures to support businesses, such as grants for electric vehicles and discounts on public transport. ""The ULEZ is essential to protect the health of Londoners and reduce air pollution,"" Khan said. ""We have provided support for businesses to help them adapt, and we will continue to work with them to ensure that they can continue to thrive."" The ULEZ is part of a wider strategy to improve air quality in London. Other measures include the introduction of a low-emission zone for buses and coaches, and the promotion of walking and cycling.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid in Scotland: 'Majority' of criminal trials on hold for lockdown,"Until the end of February only the ""most serious"" trials will proceed, to reduce the number of people needed to attend. Such cases will include those with a ""significant risk"" to life, sexual or violent offending, or vulnerable witnesses. From 1 March, all criminal trials due to begin before 28 February will be adjourned until after the end of the current lockdown period, unless they fall within the ""most serious"" category. The changes were announced by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) following a review by Scotland's senior judges during a meeting with the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC. Temporary legislation was passed in March last year to allow most hearings to be held virtually, but physical attendance is still required for trials, with witnesses present in person and jurors sitting physically distanced in courtrooms. The SCTS said it was ""essential that the sheriffs and judges can exercise their discretion in the best interests of justice"". It added: ""This can only be done by holding hearings in person in court, where it is possible to do so safely."" A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said: ""We welcome the fact that, through the use of technology and other measures, it has been possible to continue to progress many cases during the pandemic. ""However, the restrictions have had a significant impact on the ability of the criminal courts to operate at full capacity. ""We are committed to continuing to work with our partners across the justice system to do all that we can to ensure that cases are progressed as quickly as possible without compromising on the principles of justice."" The number of Covid cases in Scotland has surged in recent weeks, after the emergence of the Omicron variant. The latest figures show there were 23,607 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours - more than at any other point in the pandemic. The total number of cases confirmed since the start of the pandemic now stands at 1,000,262. Meanwhile, another 17 deaths have been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 9,663. The Scottish government has urged people to stay at home as much as possible, and to avoid social gatherings, in a bid to slow the spread of Omicron. The latest measures announced by the SCTS are designed to reduce the number of people who need to attend court, and to help prevent the spread of Covid.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Farage: May 'wilfully deceiving' people over Brexit deal,"The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would not support it in Parliament and accused Mrs May of ""wilfully deceiving"" the public about the deal's implications. Mrs May has repeatedly said that her deal is the only one that can deliver Brexit and protect jobs. But Mr Farage said it would leave the UK ""tied to the EU"" and ""subject to EU laws"". ""This is not Brexit,"" he said. ""This is a new European treaty."" Mr Farage also accused Mrs May of ""wilfully deceiving"" the public about the deal's implications. He said she had promised that the UK would be able to leave the EU without paying a ""divorce bill"", but the deal would actually see the UK paying £39bn. ""She has wilfully deceived the public,"" he said. ""She has lied to the public."" Mrs May has denied that she has misled the public about the deal. She said that the £39bn payment is a ""settlement"" for the UK's obligations to the EU, and that it is necessary to secure a smooth and orderly Brexit. The interview came as Mrs May was facing mounting pressure from within her own party to abandon her Brexit deal. Several Conservative MPs have said they will not support the deal in Parliament, and there are fears that it could be defeated when it is put to a vote. If the deal is defeated, it would plunge the UK into further political uncertainty and could lead to a no-deal Brexit. This would mean the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place, which would have a significant impact on the UK economy and could lead to chaos at the border. The Brexit Party is a pro-Brexit party that was founded by Mr Farage. It is currently the largest party in the European Parliament, and has been gaining support in recent months. Mr Farage has been a vocal critic of Mrs May's Brexit deal, and has said that he would not support it in Parliament. He has also called for Mrs May to resign as Prime Minister.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Israel eases restrictions following vaccine success,"From Sunday, shops, libraries and museums can open but social distancing and masks are still required. The health ministry says it is because of the country's successful COVID-19 vaccination programme that these restrictions can now be eased. Over 80% of the population have been fully vaccinated and over 90% of over 60s have been vaccinated. The easing of restrictions comes as a relief to many businesses and there are hopes that the economy will start to recover. However, the health ministry is warning that the pandemic is not over and people should continue to be cautious. ""We have made great progress but we are not out of the woods yet,"" said health ministry spokesman Ofer Levy. ""We need to continue to be vigilant and follow the guidelines."" The easing of restrictions has been welcomed by some but others are concerned that it is too soon. ""I'm glad that things are starting to open up again but I'm also worried that it might be too soon,"" said Jerusalem resident Sarah Cohen. ""I think we should wait a little longer to make sure that the virus is under control."" The government has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and will tighten restrictions if necessary. ""We are taking a cautious approach,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We will not hesitate to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public."" Here is a summary of the restrictions that are being eased: Shops, libraries and museums can open. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed. Indoor gatherings of up to 20 people are allowed. Restaurants and cafes can open with outdoor seating only. Hotels can open with restrictions.

Henry Moore statue: Minister's concerns over sale plan,"Len Tingle Political editor, Yorkshire Now her planned sale is provoking a national outcry and the lady is certainly not going quietly. This week there was a fierce protest with locals blocking access to the site for hours. The statue, Ascending Form, is one of 11 works by Mr Moore commissioned for the Headingley campus in the 1970s. Following the collapse of the music department five years ago, the university sold the first of the bronze figures, Oval Forms, to an art dealer. It went to a private collector in Italy and fetched £6.5m. Now the university wants to sell more of its Moore artwork – three of the most significant pieces including Ascending Form. This has angered the local community, a large number of whom donated the money to pay for the statues in the first place. They believe that the university is reneging on an agreement made in 2004, when it was granted ownership, that the sculptures would remain on campus for the enjoyment of the people of Leeds. The protesters are furious and the outcry has reached Westminster. The arts minister, Lord Parkinson, has written to the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Simone Buitendijk, expressing his concerns. The minister has also offered to meet the university and local representatives to discuss the matter. But the university has accused the protesters of spreading misinformation and insisted it is within its rights to sell the sculptures. The university says it is not planning to sell all three of the pieces. Ascending Figure could be bought back using donations, but the university says the other two are “likely to be of interest to national or international institutions”. It also argues that the funds raised from the sale of the sculptures will be used to benefit the university and its students. But Henri Brocklebank, of the Action for Moore group, says the university is trying to cash in on its “cultural inheritance”. Mr Brocklebank said: “The only thing that has changed since 2004 is that the value of the sculptures has increased. So now the university has given itself a get-out clause. “It is the people of Leeds who paid for these sculptures. Why should they be flogged off to private collectors?” The university says it is not ignoring the wishes of the Leeds people. It says it is asking the Arts Council England to review the agreement made in 2004 and hopes to reach an agreement that allows it to sell some of the statues while still satisfying the desire to “retain these important works within the public realm in Leeds”.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The Indian tribe that gave up hunting to save forests,"At one time, 76-year-old Chaiyievi Zhiinyii was a skilled hunter. But he stopped hunting in 2001. The Angami tribe gave up what was an important source of livelihood some 20 years ago in order to create a community-owned forest reserve. The Angamis are one of the largest Naga tribes in Nagaland, a state in north-eastern India. They live in the foothills of the Himalayas, and their traditional way of life has always been closely tied to the forest. In the past, the Angamis hunted for food, and also to protect their crops from animals. But as the human population grew, so too did the demand for land. The forests were being cleared for agriculture, and the animals that the Angamis hunted were becoming increasingly scarce. In the late 1990s, the Angamis realized that they needed to take action to protect their forest. In 2001, they banned hunting in their traditional territory. They also set up a community forest management committee to manage the forest and ensure that it was used sustainably. The Angamis' decision to give up hunting was a difficult one, but it has paid off. The forest has now recovered, and the animals that live there are thriving. The Angamis are also able to collect firewood, fruits, and vegetables from the forest, which provides them with a source of food and income. The Angamis' story is an inspiring example of how a community can come together to protect their environment. It is also a reminder that we all have a responsibility to protect the planet for future generations. The Angamis' community-owned forest reserve is now a model for other communities in India. It has shown that it is possible to protect the environment while also meeting the needs of the local people. The Angamis are proud of what they have achieved, and they hope that their story will inspire other communities to take action to protect their environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
NI political reaction to Birmingham pub bombing apology,"Michael Christopher Hayes is a self-confessed republican bomb-maker. He said he was sorry that 21 innocent people died in the attack in 1974. Bombs exploded in two Birmingham pubs, killing 21 people and injuring over 180 on the evening of November 21, 1974, in what became known as the Birmingham pub bombings. Hayes, who was 28 at the time and had been serving a life sentence for his role in the bombings, was released in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In a statement released through his solicitor, Hayes said: ""I want to apologize to all those who suffered because of our actions. I know that an apology will not be enough for many people, but I hope that it will at least show that I am truly sorry for what happened that night."" Hayes' apology has been welcomed by some victims' families, but others have said they find it hard to forgive. Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings, said she was not ready to accept Hayes' apology. ""I don't think he's being genuine. I think he's just saying sorry because he's been caught,"" she said. ""I don't think he understands the pain that he caused."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said that Hayes' apology was ""a step in the right direction"", but he added that ""it is important to remember that this was a horrific crime that caused unimaginable suffering to many innocent people"". Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said that Hayes' apology was ""a significant gesture"", but he added that ""it is important that we do not allow this to overshadow the ongoing campaign for justice by the victims and their families"". The Birmingham pub bombings were one of the most notorious atrocities of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The bombings were carried out by the Provisional IRA, which was fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and create a united Ireland. The families of the victims have campaigned for justice for decades, and in 2012 the British government announced a new inquiry into the bombings.

Rio 2016: 'Welcome to Hell' warn police,"By BBC Trending\ What's popular and why Along with the relatives carrying flowers and taxi drivers waiting with name boards there were lines of off-duty police with banners that had a far more ominous message: ""Welcome to Hell"". These are not the usual words of welcome at an Olympic Games, but they are a reflection of the concerns that many in Brazil have about security at the Rio Games. In the lead-up to the Olympics, there have been several violent incidents in Rio, including a mugging of a Dutch journalist and a shooting in the Olympic Park. The police in Rio have been criticised for their heavy-handed tactics, and there are concerns that they may use excessive force during the Games. Despite these concerns, the Brazilian government has insisted that the Olympics will be safe. ""We have taken all the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the athletes and the public,"" said Sergio Cabral, the governor of Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian government has deployed 85,000 security personnel to the Games, including 47,000 police officers. The police will be using a variety of tactics to keep the Games safe, including facial recognition technology, surveillance cameras, and armed patrols. However, some experts are sceptical about whether the Brazilian government will be able to keep the Games safe. ""The Brazilian government has a lot of experience in policing large events, but the Olympics is a different beast,"" said Robert Muggah, a security expert at the Igarape Institute. ""The Olympics is a global event, and it attracts a lot of attention from criminals. The Brazilian government will need to be on its guard to prevent any major security incidents."" The Olympics are a major opportunity for Brazil to showcase its culture and achievements to the world. However, the security concerns are a reminder that Brazil still has a long way to go in terms of reducing crime and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Dog microchipping to be compulsory in Wales by 2015,"The move is seen as a way to improve animal welfare and develop responsible dog ownership by helping identify strays. It is estimated 190,000 dogs will be microchipped over the next five years. The Welsh Government has said the scheme will help reunite lost dogs with their owners, reduce the number of strays in pounds, and deter dog theft. Compulsory microchipping is already in place in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government said it is working with local authorities and animal welfare organisations to implement the scheme in Wales. Microchipping involves implanting a small electronic chip under the dog's skin, which contains a unique identification number. This number can be scanned by a vet or animal welfare officer to identify the dog and its owner. The Welsh Government said it will provide funding to help local authorities and animal welfare organisations cover the cost of microchipping dogs. The British Veterinary Association (BVA) has welcomed the Welsh Government's decision to make microchipping compulsory. ""Microchipping is a simple and effective way to identify dogs and reunite them with their owners if they get lost or stolen,"" said BVA president John Fishwick. ""We believe that compulsory microchipping will help to improve animal welfare and responsible dog ownership in Wales."" The RSPCA Cymru also welcomed the Welsh Government's decision. ""Compulsory microchipping is a positive step forward for animal welfare in Wales,"" said RSPCA Cymru chief executive Chris O'Brien. ""It will help to reunite lost dogs with their owners, reduce the number of strays in pounds, and deter dog theft."" The Kennel Club has also welcomed the Welsh Government's decision.

Iran nuclear deal: Rouhani says West has no right to make changes,"The US and French leaders announced on Tuesday that they were working on a ""new deal"" that would expand and extend the terms of the 2015 accord. But Mr Rouhani said they had no right to do so. ""The nuclear deal will remain in place in its present form,"" he said. ""No one can change it, not even the US and France."" Mr Rouhani's comments came after US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Paris and discussed the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has repeatedly criticized the deal, calling it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"". He has also said that he will withdraw the US from the agreement unless it is renegotiated. Macron has said that he wants to preserve the deal, but he has also called for it to be expanded to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional activities. The other signatories to the deal - the UK, Germany, Russia and China - have all said that they want to preserve the agreement in its current form. The Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2015 after years of negotiations. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The deal has been credited with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. However, it has also been criticized for not doing enough to address Iran's other activities, such as its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism. The future of the Iran nuclear deal is uncertain. Trump has said that he will withdraw the US from the agreement unless it is renegotiated. Macron has said that he wants to preserve the deal, but he has also called for it to be expanded. The other signatories to the deal have all said that they want to preserve the agreement in its current form. It remains to be seen whether the US and France will be able to negotiate a new deal that is acceptable to all parties. If they fail to do so, the Iran nuclear deal could collapse, which would have serious consequences for the region and the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Announcing the plans on Monday, Environment Minister Mairi Gougeon said: ""We are determined to protect Scotland's seas and safeguard our extraordinary marine environment for future generations, and we know that Marine Protected Areas are vital to achieving that. ""Designating Loch Torridon as an MPA will protect the area's diverse range of marine life, including the internationally important populations of basking sharks and other large marine species, as well as critically endangered flapper skate. ""This designation will support Scotland's commitment to the protection of our seas, building on the recent agreement reached at COP15 to protect at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030."" The Scottish Wildlife Trust welcomed the announcement, saying it would help to protect ""one of Scotland's most iconic marine species"". ""Flapper skate are a critically endangered species and we need to do everything we can to protect them,"" said the trust's chief executive, Maggie Keegan. ""This designation will help to ensure that this important habitat is safeguarded for future generations."" The MPA designation will prohibit activities such as bottom trawling, dredging and scallop dredging within the area. The Scottish government said it would work with stakeholders to ensure that fishing activities that do not damage the seabed can continue. The designation of Loch Torridon as an MPA is part of a wider programme of work to protect Scotland's seas. The Scottish government has already designated 33 MPAs around the coast of Scotland and is committed to designating more in the future. MPAs are designated under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. They are a key tool for protecting Scotland's marine environment and can help to conserve and enhance marine biodiversity, safeguard and restore marine ecosystems, and promote sustainable use of marine resources.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
How many migrant children cross the English Channel?,"By William McLennan BBC News More than 7,400 people have stepped into small boats and navigated one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world to reach the south coast of England in 2020. At least six people are now thought to have died trying to make the crossing so far this year, compared with at least four last year. The figures, released by the UK government, include people who have reached the UK on small boats, such as dinghies and kayaks, as well as larger commercial vessels. In 2019, the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats was 1,843. The majority of those crossing are single men from Iran, followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. The number of women and children crossing has also increased in recent months. In the first six months of 2020, there were 1,295 children who crossed the Channel, compared with 296 in the same period last year. The Home Office said it was ""working round the clock to tackle the issue"", including increasing patrols in the Channel and working with the French authorities to prevent people from leaving France. ""We are also working to return people who have no right to be in the UK to their home countries,"" a spokesperson said. However, campaigners have said that the government's response is ""inhumane"" and called for more safe and legal routes for people to seek asylum in the UK. ""The government's failure to provide safe and legal routes for people to seek asylum is forcing people to take desperate measures, like crossing the Channel in small boats,"" said Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council.

"Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat","Kamal Ahmed Economics editor@bbckamalon Twitter That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's everyday lives is now widely accepted, by politicians and economists alike. The question that vexed Mark Carney was whether the effects are likely to persist, worsen or ease in the remaining time available to complete the UK's withdrawal negotiations with the European Union. Having concluded that any unresolved Brexit will likely inflict ""material economic harm"", the governor of the Bank of England told the Treasury Select Committee, the biggest threat is now ""the risk of a no deal Brexit"". Theresa May's deal may not be perfect, Carney said, but it at least provides business with ""clarity"" about the rules that will pertain after the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU in March next year. Without a deal, he warned, ""firms would face significant disruption to their just-in-time supply chains, the movement of their staff, and the trade in goods and services"". All of which could take the UK's economic growth ""below zero for an extended period of time"". Carney's remarks come just weeks after the prominent Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg outlined his own vision of a ""no deal"" scenario, which included the prospect of reverting to trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms. The governor did not mention Rees-Mogg by name, but he warned that increased customs checks and tariffs would impose ""significant costs"" on UK companies. ""WTO rules are not costless,"" he said. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit has been dismissed by some as scaremongering by Remainers. But the governor's comments serve as a reminder that it is a very real possibility. The government's own analysis, published in November, estimated that a no-deal Brexit would cost each UK household £2,000 a year. The Bank of England's job is not to tell the government what to do on Brexit, but to ensure it has the tools at its disposal to mitigate the negative effects. But Carney's comments make it clear that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided, if at all possible. The problem is that the prime minister has effectively ruled out changing her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected by a large margin in the House of Commons last month. And the EU has said it is not prepared to reopen the negotiation. That leaves MPs with a difficult choice. They can either accept May's deal, vote against it and risk the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, or vote against it and force a delay to Brexit. The choice is theirs, but they should bear in mind the economic consequences of each option.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ian Paisley challenges BBC over Maldives 'wrongdoing' evidence,"He was speaking for the first time since a BBC Spotlight programme. It alleged the government minister paid for part of the trip. ""If there is something untoward, I'll be the first one to say 'Mea culpa'. Frankly, I don't know what the problem is,"" he said. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician was a guest of the Maldivian government on a five-day trip to the archipelago nation in November 2014. He travelled with his wife, Rhonda, and two party staff members. The programme alleged that the former North Antrim MP did not pay for any of the trip himself. It also said that the £10,000 cost was paid for by a Maldivian businessman who is a government adviser. It claimed that this businessman's company had subsequently been given a contract to provide security equipment to the Maldives government. Mr Paisley denies any wrongdoing and has threatened legal action against the BBC. He said: ""I have never met the person who allegedly paid for the trip. Nor have I ever spoken to him."" Mr Paisley said he believed the company that paid for the trip was owned by a different Maldivian businessman, whom he knows. ""I was asked if I would go and meet with the opposition, which I had intended to do on this trip,"" he said. ""I was told I would be meeting the president, the prime minister and other ministers and I agreed to do that."" He said he had met with the Maldivian president and had also met with the leader of the then-opposition Maldivian Democratic Party. However, he did not meet any opposition figures on this particular trip. He said he believed the Maldives government had paid for the trip. ""I did not pay for any of it,"" he said. ""I am not responsible for other people's expenses."" The BBC said it stands by the story. A spokesperson said: ""We robustly defend our journalism and maintain the accuracy of our reporting.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Billy Caldwell: Campaigner's company sells cannabis oil,"Charlotte Caldwell has been treating her severely epileptic son Billy, 12, with cannabis oil since 2016. His most recent supply was confiscated at Heathrow Airport. It was returned to him after doctors made clear it was necessary to prevent life-threatening seizures. Ms Caldwell, from Castlederg, Co Tyrone, believes the oil is the only thing that stops her son's seizures - which could otherwise strike up to 100 times a day. She has now set up a not-for-profit company that aims to import and distribute the oil to other families affected by childhood epilepsy. Charlotte's Web Ireland imports and distributes Bedrolite, a cannabis oil extract from the Netherlands. Bedrolite contains THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive component of cannabis, and CBD (cannabidiol), which has no psychoactive effect. The company has not yet received a license from the UK Home Office, making it illegal to sell or distribute the oil in the UK. However, Ms Caldwell said she is prepared to challenge the law if necessary. ""I am not going to sit here and watch my son suffer,"" she told the BBC. ""I am not going to wait for the government to give me permission to save my son's life."" Ms Caldwell said she had been contacted by more than 100 families from the UK who are desperate to access cannabis oil for their children. ""These children are suffering every single day,"" she said. ""They are having seizures that could kill them. We have to do something to help them."" A spokesman for the Home Office said: ""The misuse of drugs can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. ""The government has a responsibility to protect the public from the harms caused by controlled drugs and to ensure that they are used for legitimate medical purposes only."" The spokesman added that the Home Office is ""aware of the case of Billy Caldwell and is working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure that he receives the necessary medical treatment."" Ms Caldwell's campaign has been supported by a number of high-profile figures, including the actor and campaigner Michael Sheen. Sheen said: ""I believe that Charlotte Caldwell is a remarkable woman who is doing everything she can to save her son's life. ""The government should be ashamed of themselves for not doing more to help her.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Tintin and the vanishing murals: Brussels races to save art,"In the early 1920s Hergé, then a 15-year-old Georges Remi, was a scout and student at Institut St Boniface, in the Ixelles. One day, during an outing, he and his fellow scouts came across a derelict cottage in the nearby Forest of Soignes. Intrigued, they ventured inside and discovered a series of murals depicting the adventures of a young boy and his dog. The boy in the murals bore a striking resemblance to Hergé himself, and the dog to his own wire-haired fox terrier, Milou. Inspired by the discovery, Hergé began to develop the character of Tintin, who would go on to become one of the most iconic figures in the history of comics. Fast forward to the present day, and the murals that inspired Hergé are under threat. The cottage in which they were found has been left abandoned for decades, and the murals themselves are fading and peeling. In a race against time, the City of Brussels has launched a project to restore and preserve the murals, ensuring that they can be enjoyed by future generations. The restoration project is a complex and delicate undertaking. The murals are painted on a variety of surfaces, including plaster, wood, and canvas, and each requires a different approach. Conservators are using a variety of techniques, including laser cleaning, retouching, and consolidation, to restore the murals to their former glory. The project is expected to take several years to complete, but the results are already impressive. The murals are gradually regaining their vibrant colors and intricate details, and they are beginning to tell the story of Tintin's adventures once again. The restoration of the Tintin murals is a testament to the enduring legacy of Hergé's creation. Tintin has been translated into more than 100 languages and has sold more than 250 million copies worldwide. He is a beloved character who has inspired generations of readers and artists. The murals that inspired Hergé are a precious part of Tintin's history, and their restoration is a fitting tribute to the artist and his work.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pisa literacy survey: Finland loses top spot to Asians,"The tri-annual Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) survey of 15-year-olds ranked China's Shanghai region in first place. With Finland coming third, its education system has been a source of envy for many nations. However, this latest report suggests that even the best can be challenged. The survey, which tests students' reading, mathematics, and science skills, has been conducted since 2000 and is considered one of the most comprehensive international assessments of student achievement. In the latest round of testing, Shanghai students outperformed their peers in all three subjects. Singapore and Hong Kong also ranked highly, while Finland dropped to third place. The results have sparked a debate about the reasons for Finland's decline. Some experts believe that the country's education system has become too focused on equality and that it needs to do more to challenge its top students. Others argue that Finland is simply facing the same challenges as other developed countries, such as an aging population and increasing diversity. Whatever the reasons, the Pisa results suggest that Finland's education system is no longer the gold standard it once was. The country will need to make some changes if it wants to regain its top spot. One possible explanation for Finland's decline is that the country's education system has become too focused on equality. Finland has a long tradition of egalitarianism, and its education system is designed to ensure that all students have equal access to quality education. However, some experts believe that this focus on equality has come at the expense of excellence. Another possible explanation for Finland's decline is that the country is simply facing the same challenges as other developed countries, such as an aging population and increasing diversity. As the population ages, there are fewer young people to fill the teaching positions. This can lead to a decline in the quality of teaching, which can in turn lead to a decline in student achievement. Whatever the reasons, the Pisa results suggest that Finland's education system is no longer the gold standard it once was. The country will need to make some changes if it wants to regain its top spot.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Spyware use in domestic violence 'escalating',"By Zoe Kleinman Technology reporter, BBC News Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under £50 and are easy to use. Used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, they are increasingly being deployed by abusers in domestic violence cases. In June, the government launched a consultation on its Domestic Abuse Bill, which proposes creating a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"". However, the consultation does not address the issue of spyware. Sarah*, who was in an abusive relationship, said spyware was used on her during the eight years she was with her partner. ""He always had to have his phone next to him, and I'd get messages saying 'Are you where you say you are?'"" she said. ""At first I laughed it off and said he was being a bit OTT [over the top]. But it got more sinister. He'd know where I was all the time, even if I hadn't told him."" ""I found a tracking app on his phone,"" said Sarah. ""It was really easy to use. Once it's installed on a phone, it can track everything you do - where you go, who you call, and even your messages."" ""He'd send me messages saying 'I know you're with him' or 'I know you're there', and I'd be scared. I felt like I had no privacy. He knew everything about me."" Sarah is not alone. In a survey of 2,000 women by domestic violence charity Refuge, 40% said they had been tracked or monitored by their partner. ""In the past, domestic abuse was often physical,"" said Refuge's chief executive, Sandra Horley. ""But now, with the advent of new technologies, abusers are finding new ways to control and coerce their victims."" ""Spyware is particularly insidious because it is often invisible to the victim,"" said Horley. ""It can be installed on a phone without the victim's knowledge or consent, and it can be used to track their movements, access their messages, and even record their conversations."" ""This can have a devastating impact on the victim's life,"" said Horley. ""It can make them feel isolated, it can make them fear for their safety, and it can make it difficult for them to escape the relationship."" The government needs to do more to address the issue of spyware in domestic violence cases, said Horley. ""We need to raise awareness of the issue, we need to make it easier for victims to report spyware abuse, and we need to make sure that the police have the resources to investigate these crimes.""Sarah's name has been changed to protect her identity",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Energy firm's Cheshire plans refused by councillors,"Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee voted 10 to 1 to reject IGas's plans for Ellesmere Port because of ""climate change"" concerns. The company wanted to drill for gas at Ince Marshes, near the town, but councillors said it went against the council's policies on reducing emissions. IGas said it was ""disappointed"" but would ""consider its options"". The plans were opposed by environmental groups who said the project could increase greenhouse gas emissions. They also said it was located in an area that is at risk of flooding. The planning committee heard evidence from both sides before making its decision. IGas said the project would create jobs and help to reduce the UK's reliance on imported gas. The company also said it had taken steps to minimize the environmental impact of the project. However, the council's planning committee said the project was not in line with the council's policies on climate change. The committee also said it was not convinced that the project would create enough jobs to justify the environmental impact. IGas said it was ""disappointed"" by the council's decision. In a statement, the company said: ""We are disappointed by the decision of Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee to refuse our planning application for Ince Marshes. ""We believe that this project would have created jobs, reduced the UK's reliance on imported gas, and helped to meet the UK's energy needs in a responsible way. ""We will now consider our options."" The decision by the council's planning committee is the latest setback for IGas.

Did Boris Johnson just announce an election without actually doing so?,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor @bbclaurak Twitter He's always said that he really doesn't want to go to the country again. Downing Street insists that all the talk of an imminent election is just ""Westminster chatter"". But there's a different tone now and it's coming from the top. Today, Boris Johnson signalled that he is preparing for an election, telling Sky News: ""I don't want an election, but if there is one, we'll fight it and we'll win it."" It's a significant shift in language from the prime minister, who has until now been adamant that he doesn't want an election. So what's changed? One possibility is that Johnson has been spooked by the recent polls, which suggest that Labour is now ahead. Another possibility is that he believes that an election would give him a chance to break the deadlock in Parliament and get his Brexit deal through. Whatever his reasons, it's clear that Johnson is now preparing for an election. He's doing the things that a prime minister would do if they were planning to go to the country, such as setting out his vision for the future and attacking the opposition. Of course, it's still possible that Johnson will change his mind and decide not to call an election. But the latest comments from the prime minister suggest that he is increasingly likely to do so. If Johnson does call an election, it will be the third general election in less than five years. It would also be a high-stakes election, with the future of Brexit and the country's political landscape at stake. The latest YouGov poll, conducted on 13-14 October, put Labour on 38%, the Conservatives on 33%, the Liberal Democrats on 12%, the Brexit Party on 7% and the Greens on 5%. The poll also found that 40% of voters think Johnson is doing a bad job as prime minister, while 31% think he is doing a good job. The Conservatives have been trailing Labour in the polls for several months, and Johnson's personal ratings have also been falling. If the polls are accurate, Johnson would face an uphill battle to win an election. However, the prime minister has a track record of defying the odds, and he will be hoping to do so again at the next election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence,"Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities. It works. Amsterdam is to adopt an approach to reducing violence that has been successfully used in Cardiff. The Dutch city is to introduce a system of 'violence reduction units' (VRUs) which will bring together police, health and community groups to tackle the root causes of violence. The VRUs will work to identify and support people who are at risk of becoming involved in violence, and to provide them with access to services such as education, employment and housing. The approach is based on the work of Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University. Professor Shepherd has argued that violence is a public health issue, and that it can be reduced by addressing the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to it. The approach has been credited with helping to reduce violence in Cardiff. According to figures from the Home Office, the number of violent crimes recorded in Cardiff fell by 13% in the year to March 2022. This is compared to a 6% increase in violent crime across England and Wales as a whole. Professor Shepherd said: ""I am delighted that Amsterdam is to adopt our approach to reducing violence. This is a clear sign that our work is having an impact, and that it can be replicated in other cities."" The VRUs will be introduced in Amsterdam in the coming months. The city's mayor, Femke Halsema, said: ""We are committed to making Amsterdam a safer city for everyone. We believe that the violence reduction unit approach can help us to achieve this goal."" The VRUs will be part of a wider strategy to reduce violence in Amsterdam. The city is also investing in community policing, and in programmes to support young people who are at risk of becoming involved in violence. The Dutch city of Rotterdam is also considering adopting the Cardiff approach. Rotterdam is one of the most violent cities in the Netherlands, and the city council is keen to find ways to reduce violence. The Cardiff approach is a promising new approach to reducing violence. It is based on the evidence that violence is a public health issue, and that it can be reduced by addressing the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to it. The VRUs will be introduced in Amsterdam in the coming months. It will be interesting to see whether the approach can be as successful in Amsterdam as it has been in Cardiff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Rhino poaching: South Africa and Vietnam sign deal,"The price of rhino horn - used in traditional medicine in Asian countries - has soared. Rhino poaching is already banned under international conventions but the extent of the problem across Africa remains stubbornly high, driven by the huge profits to be made. South Africa is home to the majority of the world's rhinos. In 2017, 1,028 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa alone. In 2018, this number rose to 1,349. Vietnam is one of the largest markets for rhino horn, which is used in traditional medicine to treat a range of ailments, including cancer and impotence. The demand for rhino horn has led to a surge in poaching in South Africa, where the animals are often killed by armed gangs. The deal between South Africa and Vietnam is aimed at tackling the illegal trade in rhino horn. It will see the two countries work together to strengthen law enforcement, improve intelligence sharing, and reduce demand for rhino horn. The deal is a welcome step forward in the fight against rhino poaching. However, it is important to remember that this is a complex issue with no easy solutions. The demand for rhino horn in Asia is likely to continue to drive poaching, and it will take sustained efforts from all stakeholders to protect these iconic animals. In addition to the demand for rhino horn in Asia, there are a number of other factors that have contributed to the rise in poaching in South Africa. These include: Weak law enforcement: The South African government has been criticized for not doing enough to combat poaching. In many cases, poachers are able to operate with impunity. Corruption: Corruption within the South African government and law enforcement agencies has also been linked to the rise in poaching. This has made it difficult to bring poachers to justice. Poverty: Many of the people who are involved in poaching are poor and desperate. They see poaching as a way to make a living. The deal between South Africa and Vietnam is a positive step forward, but it is only one part of the solution. In order to effectively tackle rhino poaching, it is important to address all of the factors that are driving it. This includes strengthening law enforcement, reducing corruption, and addressing the poverty that is driving people to poach. It is also important to educate people in Asia about the devastating impact that the illegal trade in rhino horn is having on these iconic animals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""Seren has been on these medications for several years and they have been very effective in reducing her seizures. ""The thought of changing her medication at this stage is very worrying.""

TfW is currently replacing its entire fleet with new trains. The first of the new trains are due to enter service on the Core Valley Lines in north-east Wales in the autumn of 2023.

Coronavirus: Transport for London expects to lose £4bn,"Ahead of an emergency finance committee meeting, the organisation said it needs £3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for the next two years. The remainder would come from existing cash reserves of £900m, which the organisation said was ""unsustainable"". Sadiq Khan has asked the government to provide ""urgent financial support"" to TfL, which has lost fare revenue as passenger numbers plummeted during the pandemic. He said the government support was ""essential to avoid very difficult decisions that would damage London's economy"". The emergency budget assumes there will be no return to pre-pandemic patronage, and that revenue will only account for 70% of operating costs. The fare increase was originally due to come into effect in January 2023, but TfL said it was now proposing to introduce it in March to raise more funds. The budget also proposed increasing the congestion charge for the most polluting vehicles from £12.50 to £24 in October 2023. TfL has already received about £4bn in government support during the pandemic. The transport authority said it was ""committed to working with the government to find a mutually acceptable solution that ensures TfL can continue to deliver its vital services efficiently, without the need for significant cuts to its services or staff"". A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the challenges facing TfL and are committed to working closely with the mayor to reach a fair and sustainable settlement. ""We continue to provide multi-billion pound support and have recently agreed the principles of a long-term funding settlement. ""We urge the mayor to take urgent action to improve TfL's financial position, including exploring additional commercial opportunities to generate revenue, reduce costs, and prioritise investment in the network.""

Anti-Semitic Valentine at Republican student event sparks outrage,"Warning: Some readers may find some language offensive College Republicans at Central Michigan University were distributing gift bags to students that included a Valentine's Day card containing a message widely condemned as anti-Semitic.

The group has also removed the cards from circulation and said that it will be conducting sensitivity training for its members. The incident has sparked outrage on campus and beyond. Many students have expressed their disgust and anger at the distribution of the cards. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" said one student. ""I'm disgusted that this happened on our campus."" Another student said: ""This is not just a joke. This is hate speech. It's dangerous and it needs to be condemned."" The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, has also condemned the incident. ""This is a clear example of anti-Semitism,"" said ADL regional director David Lorenz. ""The use of the swastika and the phrase 'gas the Jews' is deeply offensive and hateful."" Lorenz said that the incident is a reminder of the need for continued vigilance against anti-Semitism.

Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen re-labelled food,"The inspection of the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel found food had been re-labelled to extend its shelf life. Dozens of containers of items - including discoloured meat and fish - were uncovered by Aberdeen City Council's environmental health officers. The hotel, located in the city centre, has since been re-branded as the Sandman Signature Aberdeen Hotel & Spa. The council's report said: ""During our inspection, the following issues were noted which were of major concern."" Food items were being re-labelled with new dates to extend their shelf life. Discoloured meat and fish were being stored in the chiller. Cooked meat was being stored at an unsafe temperature. Raw meat was being stored above cooked meat. Food was being stored in open containers. The kitchen was dirty and unhygienic. The council's environmental health officers served the hotel with a prohibition notice, which means that the hotel cannot serve food until the issues have been resolved. A spokesperson for the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel said: ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our guests.

Snow disruption warning stepped down,"Snow disruption warning stepped down It steps down Police Scotland advice to stage two after being escalated to stage four ""do not travel"" overnight. A yellow Met Office weather warning for snow is in place until 12pm today. Stage two of Police Scotland's guidance means that road travel should only be undertaken when essential, and only if the journey can be completed safely. Stage four advice, which was in place from 8pm on Monday until 9am on Tuesday, meant that the public were told that all non-essential travel should be avoided. The Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice covers central, southern, and eastern parts of Scotland, as well as parts of northern England, including Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, and Yorkshire and the Humber. The warning states that snow and ice could cause disruption to travel and may lead to power cuts and loss of mobile phone signal. The Scottish Government has urged people to follow the advice of Police Scotland and the Met Office. A spokesperson said: ""The safety of the public is our top priority. We urge everyone to follow the advice of the police and the Met Office. If you have to travel, please do so with extreme care and only if your journey is essential."" The Scottish Government has also advised schools to make their own decisions on whether to close based on the local conditions. A spokesperson said: ""Head teachers will be best placed to make a decision on whether or not to close their school based on the local weather conditions. They will be able to take into account factors such as the safety of pupils and staff, the accessibility of the school, and the availability of public transport."" The latest weather forecast for Scotland can be found on the Met Office website. Advice for motorists Only travel if your journey is essential. If you do have to travel, check the latest weather forecast and road conditions before you set off. Allow extra time for your journey and take breaks as needed. Be prepared for delays and cancellations. Make sure your vehicle is well-maintained and has winter tires fitted. Carry a winter emergency kit in your vehicle, including items such as blankets, food, water, and a first-aid kit.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Russia: Fire kills 14 sailors aboard navy research submersible,"The crew was poisoned by fumes as the vessel was taking measurements in Russian territorial waters on Monday. The ministry gave no details about the type of vessel. But Russian media reports say it was an AS-12 Losharik-class deep-diving nuclear submarine. LOSHarik submarines are designed for underwater research, rescue operations and special missions. The vessel was said to have been operating in the Barents Sea when the fire broke out. The submarine managed to surface, and the crew evacuated onto a rescue vessel, the ministry said. But 14 sailors died from smoke inhalation. The rest of the crew received medical assistance, with three in a serious condition. The ministry said that all necessary measures were being taken to establish the cause of the fire and to provide assistance to the victims' families. Accidents involving Russian military vessels have happened before. In 2000, the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk was destroyed in a huge explosion, killing all 118 crew members. And in 2019, 14 sailors died in a fire on board a research submersible in the Pacific Ocean. Following Monday's disaster, the Russian navy has suspended all deep-sea operations. The AS-12 Losharik-class submarines are relatively new, entering service in 2003. They are designed to operate at depths of up to 6,000 metres (19,685 ft) and can stay submerged for up to 100 days. The submarines are equipped with a variety of sensors and equipment for underwater research and exploration. The Russian navy has a long history of operating submarines, dating back to the 19th century. The country has one of the largest submarine fleets in the world, with over 50 submarines in service. The submarines play a key role in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy and are also used for intelligence gathering and other missions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
How Meryl became Margaret,"By Tim Masters Entertainment correspondent, BBC News, in Los Angeles Mark Coulier is one half of the team that transformed one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars into one of Britain's most iconic prime ministers. The Oscar-winning make-up artist says Meryl Streep, who plays Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, was instantly recognisable in the role. ""She looks like her, she sounds like her, her mannerisms are like her,"" Coulier told the BBC. ""But because the face is so familiar, the audience will be looking to find Meryl Streep. So part of the job is to distract the audience from that."" The first step was to take a mould of Streep's face and make a plaster cast of it. This cast was then covered with a special make-up that became Thatcher's skin. Coulier had to be extremely precise in his work. ""We had to get the age right, and we had to get the character right,"" he said. ""We also had to make sure that the make-up was not too heavy, because it would have interfered with Meryl's performance."" Coulier spent hours studying photographs and videos of Thatcher to get her look just right. He also had to take into account the fact that Streep would be wearing a wig and heavy prosthetics. ""We had to make sure that the prosthetics fit perfectly and that they didn't move around when Meryl was speaking,"" Coulier said. ""We also had to make sure that the make-up stayed in place under the lights and in different weather conditions."" Coulier's work on The Iron Lady has been praised by critics and audiences alike. In a review of the film, the New York Times said that Streep's performance was ""so physically accurate that it's almost uncanny."" Coulier is proud of his work on The Iron Lady, but he says that the most important thing was to help Streep create a believable and compelling performance. ""I wanted to create a make-up that would allow Meryl to disappear into the role,"" he said. ""I think we achieved that.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Myanmar court finds trio guilty of insulting religion,"Philip Blackwood, who managed the VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested in December along with bar owner Tun Thurein and colleague Htut. They were accused of insulting religion after a photo of them standing near a sign that referenced the Buddha in an allegedly disrespectful way was posted on Facebook. All three men denied the charges. The court heard that the defendants had been drinking at the bar when they decided to take a photo in front of the sign, which read ""The Best F*ing Curry in Yangon"". The prosecution argued that the photo was offensive to Buddhists because it showed the men standing with their backs to the Buddha image and making hand gestures that were considered disrespectful. The defendants' lawyers argued that the photo was not intended to be offensive and that the men had no intention of insulting religion. They said that the men were simply having fun and that the photo was taken in a light-hearted manner. The court found all three men guilty of insulting religion and sentenced them to two and a half years in prison. The defendants' lawyers said that they would appeal the verdict. The case has been widely condemned by human rights groups, who say that it is a violation of freedom of expression. The United States Embassy in Myanmar has also expressed concern about the verdict, saying that it ""undermines freedom of religion and expression"". The verdict has also sparked protests in Myanmar, with hundreds of people taking to the streets to demand the release of the defendants. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some reports of violence. The case has highlighted the challenges that Myanmar faces in balancing freedom of expression with respect for religion. The country is home to a number of different religions, and there is a long history of religious tension. The government has been trying to promote religious tolerance, but the case of the VGastro Bar defendants has shown that there is still a long way to go.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Eurovision Song Contest: Ireland knocked out,"By Neil Smith Entertainment reporter, Kiev Galway-born Brendan Murray, 20, had a hot-air balloon with him on stage in Kiev, but it was not enough to lift him into the Eurovision final. Murray made headlines with his whimsical performance of Dying to Try in Tuesday's semi-final but the song failed to take flight with voters. The singer was Ireland's first Eurovision entrant since 2015 and looked emotional as the results were being announced. ""Thank you so much Ireland, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me this amazing opportunity,"" he wrote on Twitter after the show. ""The memories I've made over the past few weeks will stay with me forever. I'm gutted not to qualify for Eurovision but it's been an incredible experience."" Ireland has won the Eurovision Song Contest seven times, more than any other country, but Murray's defeat means the country will not be in the final for the fourth year in a row. Murray's performance was one of the most talked-about moments of the semi-final. He emerged from a large hot-air balloon wearing a sequined suit and clutching a microphone stand topped with a giant pair of angel wings. The song itself was a catchy pop number with a soaring chorus, but it was not enough to convince voters to part with their points. Ireland was one of 18 countries competing in the first semi-final, with only 10 progressing to the final on Saturday. The other countries to qualify were Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Moldova and Sweden. The United Kingdom is automatically in the final as one of the ""big five"" countries, along with France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The remaining 10 finalists will be decided in Thursday's second semi-final, with the final taking place on Saturday.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Japan protests over China ships near disputed islands,"This is the first such protest under new PM Shinzo Abe, who was elected last month. It also comes amid reports that he wants to increase defence spending. Chinese ships have sailed near the islands many times in the past, and the two countries have been embroiled in a long-running dispute over who owns them. The islands are known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China. Japan says it has controlled the islands since 1895, but China says it has a long history of control over them. The dispute flared up again last month when Japan bought some of the islands from a private owner. China sent ships to the area in response, and the two sides have been engaged in a series of diplomatic protests ever since. The latest protest is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. It comes at a time when there is already tension between them over a number of issues, including trade and China's growing military power. The dispute over the islands is also seen as a test of Abe's resolve to stand up to China. Abe has taken a more hawkish stance on foreign policy than his predecessor, and he has promised to defend Japan's territory. However, he is also aware of the need to maintain good relations with China, which is Japan's largest trading partner. The protest over the ships is a sign that Abe is willing to take a tough line with China, but it is also likely to be a calculated risk. If the dispute escalates, it could have serious consequences for both countries.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Wales' child safety 'needs more co-ordination ,' says charity","On top of this, the report calls for a ""whole-government approach to child accident prevention"" with road and water safety the priorities, as well as home safety. The charity is also promoting 'play safety zones' where children can play freely without the risk of traffic, and for reduced speed limits around schools and other places where young people gather. The report also found that: • More than 30% of parents said they do not feel confident giving first aid to their children. • 300 children under 15 in Wales die or are seriously injured in accidents every year. • Accidents in the home account for almost a fifth of deaths or serious injuries among Welsh children. The NSPCC Cymru/Wales conducted an opinion poll among 1,000 parents in Wales of children aged 0-14, and gathered their experiences of accidents and safety concerns. The charity's head of service for Wales, Des Mannion, said: ""Children learn from their experiences and accidents can happen when they are exploring their surroundings and trying out new things. ""But we can prevent many childhood accidents from happening at all, and we can also reduce the severity of injuries by taking steps to make the places where children live and play safer. ""All parents can follow our simple advice to help prevent accidents, but more action is needed from government and professionals to make our communities safer for all children. ""This means improved training for staff working with children, a greater focus on road safety by local authorities and more resources for initiatives to educate parents and children about safety issues."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We welcome the NSPCC's report and share its aims of reducing the number of accidents involving children in Wales. ""We have already introduced a number of measures to improve child safety, including reducing the default speed limit on restricted roads to 20 mph, and we are committed to working with our partners to further improve child safety in Wales."" The Welsh government has also recently launched a new road safety campaign, 'Be Safe, Be Seen', which is aimed at reducing the number of children killed or seriously injured on the roads. The campaign is urging parents to ensure that their children are visible to drivers when they are out and about, by wearing bright clothing and using reflective materials.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sydney seaplane crash: Wreckage raised from riverbed,"On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage of the seaplane from the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, on Friday. The plane was raised from about 50m (165ft) underwater. The bodies of those on board were not found inside, but it is hoped the operation will help police determine how the crash occurred. The seaplane had been travelling from Sydney to Rose Bay when it crashed on New Year's Eve. Australian police said the plane was lifted slowly out of the water at a rate of 3m (10ft) per hour, with the process being delayed by the need to clear debris from the riverbed. Once the wreckage was raised, it was taken to a facility where it will be stored until further forensic examination can be carried out. Police divers had previously recovered the plane's fuselage and one of its floats, but the main body of the aircraft remained submerged. The crash is being investigated by Australian authorities. Preliminary findings suggest the plane sent out a distress signal before crashing, but it is not yet known what caused the incident. The victims have been identified as Mr Cousins, 58, his partner Emma Bowden, 48, his two sons Edward, 23, and William, 25, his daughter Sophie, 22, and the pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. Mr Cousins was the former chief executive of Compass Group, a UK-based food services multinational. He was also a director of the BBC and a former member of the UK government's Business Advisory Group. Paying tribute to him, Prime Minister Theresa May described him as ""a great British business leader"". ""He was a passionate advocate for business and his contribution to the UK economy was immense,"" she said. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is also investigating the crash. It is expected to release a preliminary report into the incident within the next six to eight weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid: North East hospitals warn over 'rapidly rising' admissions,"Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital has temporarily suspended non-urgent elective surgery to free up staff. In a joint statement, the bosses of several health trusts said they were having to deal with ""rapidly rising"" numbers of covid-related admissions. The number of Covid patients in North East hospitals has increased by 50% in the last week, with 1,118 people now being treated. The bosses of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said the rise was putting ""significant pressure"" on the region's hospitals. ""We are seeing a rapidly rising number of patients with COVID-19 and this is having a significant impact on our hospitals,"" they said. ""As a result, we have had to make the difficult decision to temporarily suspend non-urgent elective surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead. ""This will allow us to free up staff to care for the increasing number of patients with COVID-19. ""We understand that this will be disappointing for patients who have been waiting for surgery, but we hope they will understand that this is a necessary step to ensure that we can continue to provide safe and effective care for all of our patients."" The bosses said they were doing everything they could to increase the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients and were working with other NHS organisations in the region to ensure that patients could be transferred to the most appropriate hospital. They urged people to continue to follow the government's advice on social distancing, wearing face masks in indoor public places, and getting vaccinated. ""The best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 is to get vaccinated,"" they said.

Covid: Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health boards offer tests for 'flu symptoms',"People in the Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health board areas with flu symptoms or who are unwell after contact with a confirmed Covid case can get tested. People are being urged to take up the offer even if they have had a negative Covid test in the past. The director of public health for Hywel Dda, Dr Brendan Mason, said: “We would encourage people to get tested for both flu and Covid-19 this winter, particularly if they have any symptoms, as it will help to protect both themselves and their loved ones.” Cwm Taf Morgannwg is offering mass testing for anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the county borough. The testing is being carried out at walk-in test centres in Aberdare, Merthyr and Mountain Ash. The leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Andrew Morgan, said: “We strongly encourage everyone who can get tested to do so.” The Welsh government announced earlier this week that everyone over the age of 65 in Wales will be offered a free flu vaccine this winter. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said: “I urge everyone who is eligible to take up the offer of a free flu vaccine.” The flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself against the flu. It is safe and effective, and it can help to reduce your risk of getting the flu by up to 60%. If you do get the flu, the vaccine can help to reduce the severity of your symptoms. The NHS is also offering free flu vaccines to people who are pregnant, have a long-term health condition, or are in a care home. You can book an appointment for a flu vaccine at your GP surgery or local pharmacy. The flu virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing, or close contact with someone who is infected. Symptoms of the flu can include fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. The flu can be a serious illness, and it can lead to hospitalisation or even death. If you have any symptoms of the flu, it is important to stay at home and get tested.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Canada's 'free the beer' case loses in Supreme Court,"Canada's top court upheld a New Brunswick liquor law limiting the amount of alcohol that can be carried across its provincial border. In 2012, Gerald Comeau was stopped and fined for bringing more than the 12-pint maximum into the province. He challenged the law, arguing that it violated his mobility rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 against Comeau, finding that the law was a valid exercise of the province's authority to regulate alcohol sales. The Court found that the law was aimed at protecting public health and safety by reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm. It noted that New Brunswick has a higher rate of alcohol-related deaths and hospitalizations than other provinces. The Court also found that the law was not overly restrictive, as it allowed individuals to bring a reasonable amount of alcohol into the province for personal use. The Court's decision is a blow to those who advocate for the free movement of alcohol across provincial borders. However, it is also a reminder that provinces have the authority to regulate alcohol sales in order to protect public health and safety. The decision is also likely to have implications for other provinces that have similar laws. For example, Nova Scotia has a law that limits the amount of alcohol that can be brought into the province to 12 pints of beer, 12 ounces of spirits, or 1.5 litres of wine. It is possible that this law could also be challenged in court. The Supreme Court's decision is a complex one that weighs the individual's right to mobility against the province's right to regulate alcohol sales. Ultimately, the Court found that the province's interest in protecting public health and safety outweighed the individual's right to bring more alcohol into the province.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
China jails two more Tibetan monks over fire death,"Chinese authorities say the man, Rigzin Phuntsog of the Kirti monastery, immolated himself on 16 March. Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum will be jailed for 13 and 10 years respectively for ""intentional homicide"", Xinhua reported. The pair protested against Beijing's rule in Tibet, as well as China's treatment of the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule and now lives in India. The court heard the monks had spread leaflets and set fire to Tsering Tenzin's house to lure police to the scene, Xinhua reported. The monks had given Rigzin Phuntsog petrol and a lighter, the report said. The court was told that Tsering Tenzin ""felt ashamed"" after police put out the fire at his home. ""But he and Tenchum encouraged the victim to continue carrying out his self-immolation action, which resulted in the victim setting himself on fire again,"" Xinhua news agency reported. The court said it had taken into consideration the fact that the pair had confessed and pleaded guilty. The verdict comes as Beijing is stepping up security in Tibetan areas after reports of several self-immolations. Chinese state media said troops have been deployed in the Tibetan area of Kardze, where there were five self-immolations over the last month. Meanwhile, in London, the protesters outside the Chinese embassy clashed with police as they tried to enter the building. About 150 members of the Tibetan community and their supporters were demonstrating against the jailing of the monks. The protesters shouted slogans and waved Tibetan flags and placards before police moved in to push them back. The demonstrators said they were angry about the sentences and wanted the Chinese government to respect Tibetan rights. ""We are here to protest against the unlawful arrest and imprisonment of the two Tibetan monks,"" said Karma Yeshi, a spokesman for the Tibetan Community in the UK. ""They have been charged with intentional homicide, which is a serious charge, but they are innocent,"" he said. ""The Chinese authorities have failed to provide any evidence to support the charges and we believe they have been jailed for their peaceful protests against China's oppressive rule in Tibet.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jack Phillips: Boy from Godalming became Titanic hero,"By Sally Nancarrow BBC News, Surrey The son of a draper, Jack Phillips operated the most modern and powerful wireless equipment of any merchant ship of the time. But before the doomed vessel sailed, he learnt it was to be called Titanic rather than Olympic. The ships were often confused, as they were almost identical sister ships built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. Born in Godalming, Surrey, the son of a draper, Phillips joined the Royal Naval Reserve, but suffered from seasickness so became a wireless operator instead. Aged 25, and just two months into his first job as a radio operator on the Amerika, he was called up to join the Titanic. Phillips was one of the two wireless operators on board and the only one to survive the sinking. For over 70 years after the ship hit an iceberg and sank on the night of 14 April 1912, it was believed that Phillips had gone down with the ship. But in 1985, his body was identified in a Nova Scotia cemetery. His grave bears an inscription reading: ""In loving memory of Jack Phillips, wireless operator on the ill-fated SS Titanic, who gave his life in the service of others."" 'A Titanic struggle' Some 80 years after his death, Phillips's great-nephew, Ian Phillips, a retired police officer from Farnham, Surrey, wrote a book, A Titanic Struggle, about his life and death. ""I grew up knowing about Jack. He was a bit of a hero,"" he told the BBC. ""When I started researching his life, I was particularly struck by his tenacity and his determination to complete a task. ""He finished sending that final distress call, which led to lifeboats being despatched to help some of the passengers survive."" Phillips tirelessly tried to get a distress message out. One of the last messages sent was: ""Come at once. We have struck a berg."" He stayed at his post in the Marconi wireless room despite taking time to put on a lifejacket. Phillips may have lived if he had got into a lifeboat, as his body was found with a lifejacket on. The Marconi wireless room was on the port side of the Titanic and therefore most exposed to the freezing water when the ship sank. His body was among the first to be recovered, just six days after the ship went down. Phillips was buried in Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where many of the Titanic dead were laid to rest, but his body was exhumed in 1985. DNA testing was used to positively identify his remains, which were reburied in the same plot. Phillips's story was brought to life again in the 1997 James Cameron film Titanic. The character Harold Bride, who sent the final distress call, was based partly on Phillips. His great-nephew believes Phillips has been undervalued in the aftermath of the Titanic disaster. ""He was a Godalming boy who achieved international fame and has been largely forgotten,"" said Ian Phillips.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Church of England schools tackle gay bullying,"The Bible or religious texts should not be used to justify homophobic behaviour, says the advice sent to all Church of England schools. But homosexuality is recognised as a ""divisive issue"" in the church. The guidance says that all pupils, staff, and visitors should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. It adds that schools should: - Create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students - Challenge homophobic behaviour and language - Support students who are experiencing homophobic bullying - Work with parents and carers to promote understanding and acceptance ""We want to make it clear that there is no place for homophobia in our schools. We want to create a safe and welcoming environment where all pupils feel respected and valued,"" said Nigel Genders, chief education officer for the Church of England. In recent years, the Church of England has come under increasing pressure to clarify its stance on homosexuality. In 2017, the General Synod, the church's governing body, voted to reject a motion that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in church. The decision was met with disappointment by many LGBT+ Christians and their supporters. It also led to calls for the church to do more to tackle homophobia in its schools. The new guidance is a step in the right direction. It sends a clear message that homophobia is not tolerated in Church of England schools. It also provides schools with practical guidance on how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. However, the guidance does not go as far as some LGBT+ campaigners would like. For example, it does not require schools to teach about same-sex relationships in a positive way. Despite these limitations, the guidance is a welcome step forward. It shows that the Church of England is taking the issue of homophobia in schools seriously. It also provides schools with the tools they need to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The university said it was ""disappointed"" by the virtual protests and that it was ""confident that the vast majority of our students feel supported and positive about their learning experiences."" The protests come as universities across the UK face criticism for their handling of the pandemic. Students at several other universities have also staged protests over issues such as rent, online learning, and mental health support. The National Union of Students (NUS) has called on the government to provide more financial support to students and to ensure that universities are providing a high-quality education online. The government has said that it is committed to supporting students during the pandemic and has announced a number of measures, including a £256m package of support for students in financial hardship. However, the NUS has said that more needs to be done to ensure that all students are able to access the support they need. The University of Exeter said it was ""committed to providing a high-quality education for all of our students"" and that it was ""working hard to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.""

Swine flu offers 'extraordinary super immunity',"By Michelle Roberts Health reporter, BBC News In beating a bout of H1N1 the body makes antibodies that can kill many other flu strains, a study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine shows. Doctors' hopes of developing an effective universal flu vaccine have been boosted by the discovery that natural infection with swine flu produces antibodies which can tackle many different strains of the virus. Flu is caused by an influenza virus that is constantly changing. This means the body needs to be exposed to a new vaccine every year. But scientists have been trying to develop a universal vaccine that would offer protection against all strains of flu. Now a study by researchers at Imperial College London and the US National Institutes of Health suggests that a Bout of H1N1 could act like a universal vaccine. They found that people who had recovered from swine flu developed antibodies that were able to recognise the 'stalk' of different strains of flu. The stalk portion of the influenza virus is well conserved, meaning that it does not change much from one strain to the next. This means that an antibody that can recognise the stalk can potentially kill a wide range of flu strains. Dr Michael Farzan, one of the authors of the study, said: ""We were very excited to find out that antibodies from individuals infected with H1N1 can neutralise these viruses, which belong to different subtypes and have different hemagglutinin proteins. ""This means that natural infection could induce a form of cross-immunity that we have not seen before with other flus."" Participants who recovered from H1N1 were able to generate antibodies that neutralised the H1N1 virus they had been exposed to, but also the strains of flu virus involved in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the bird flu strain, H5N1, and two other strains of H1N1 swine flu. The researchers say that the study offers hope for developing a universal flu vaccine. ""This is a promising finding for the development of universal flu vaccines because it suggests that boosting antibodies to the influenza virus stalk could protect against viruses that may be very different from those encountered in the past,"" said Dr Farzan. However, the researchers caution that it will take many years of research to develop, test and refine a universal flu vaccine that is safe and effective. ""We need to understand a little bit more about how these antibodies are induced by natural infection,"" said Dr Farzan. ""But I think that this is a lead that we will pursue for our research going forward.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Saudi Arabia's women vote in election for first time,"Women were also standing as candidates, another first, despite the conservative kingdom being the only nation where women are not allowed to drive. A total of 978 women have registered as candidates in 13 of the country's 13 regions, competing for 20 seats allocated for women in the 150-member assembly. Among them is Samia al-Bakri, a 46-year-old running in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. ""I am so proud of this moment. I have waited long for this,"" she said before the first round of voting on December 12. The female candidates represent a range of backgrounds and expertise, including doctors, lawyers, teachers, and businesswomen. Their decision to stand for election reflects a growing desire among Saudi women to have a greater role in public life. ""Women's participation in the elections is a significant milestone in the history of Saudi Arabia,"" said Dr. Hala al-Dosari, a prominent Saudi women's rights activist. ""It sends a message that women are just as capable as men to contribute to the decision-making process."" The local elections are part of a wider process of reforms initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has sought to modernize the country and improve its image abroad. However, women's rights activists have criticized the government for not doing enough to address other restrictions on women, such as the driving ban and the male guardianship system that requires women to have permission from a male relative to travel, work, or study. Despite these limitations, many Saudi women are optimistic that the local elections will be a positive step towards greater equality. ""This is just the beginning,"" said Aisha al-Mana, a 25-year-old voter. ""We have a long way to go, but we are moving in the right direction."" The elections are also being closely watched by other countries in the region, where women's rights are often severely restricted. The participation of Saudi women in the political process could inspire similar reforms elsewhere. The local elections are an important step forward for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. While there is still much work to be done, the participation of women in the political process is a sign of progress. It is hoped that these elections will lead to greater equality and representation for women in the kingdom.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Life-extending lung cancer nivolumab drug approved,"Campaigners, including the late Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill, have repeatedly called for access to the immunotherapy, which can add months to life. Scotland already provides the drug through its health service. Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ""We strongly welcome this announcement which will save lives, and it is an important moment for UK cancer care. ""For too long, patients in England have faced unnecessary delays in getting access to nivolumab. Now, they will benefit from the same level of care as those in countries such as Scotland and Wales. ""Nivolumab demonstrates the transformational power of cancer immunotherapy. It is a new type of cancer treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells. ""Nivolumab has shown great promise in clinical trials, and it is already helping thousands of patients with lung cancer and other types of cancer around the world. ""We look forward to seeing the NHS quickly implementing the use of nivolumab so that all patients who could benefit from it can access it as soon as possible."" Dr Alex Stewart, Cancer Research UK's head of population science, said: ""This is excellent news for patients with advanced lung cancer in England. ""Nivolumab has been shown to improve survival in patients with this type of cancer, and it is a welcome addition to the range of treatments available to them. ""We hope that the NHS will now quickly implement the use of nivolumab so that all patients who could benefit from it can access it as soon as possible.""

UK to probe Huawei staff's role at cybersecurity centre,"The news follows a report by Parliament's intelligence committee which raised concerns that staff working at the base in Oxfordshire were employed by the Chinese telecoms firm. Part of their job is to test Huawei's own equipment. The government has said it will now conduct its own investigation into the matter. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We are aware of the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and we are considering its findings."" The report, which was published on Tuesday, said that the government had ""failed to take account of the national security risks"" of allowing Huawei to work at the centre. It also said that the government had ""not properly considered"" the potential for Huawei to use its access to the centre to gather intelligence. The government has defended its decision to allow Huawei to work at the centre, saying that the company is a ""valued partner"" in the UK's telecommunications industry. However, the report's findings have raised concerns about the government's approach to cybersecurity. The report comes at a time when the UK is facing increasing pressure from the US to ban Huawei from its 5G networks. The US has accused Huawei of being a security risk, and has urged its allies to do the same. The UK government has so far resisted pressure from the US, but the report's findings could make it more difficult for the government to continue to support Huawei. The report's findings are likely to fuel the debate about the role of Chinese companies in the UK's critical infrastructure. The government will need to carefully consider the report's findings and decide how to respond.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UK government to press for European Court reform,"Ken Clarke said the government would press for changes to the way the court operated when the UK takes over the chairmanship of the Council of Europe. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, he said the UK had been “too quick” to condemn the court in the past and should now focus on reforming it from within. The court has been criticized for being too slow, too expensive, and too political. Clarke said the government would propose changes to make the court more efficient and less bureaucratic. He also said the UK would push for the court to be given more powers to enforce its rulings. The Council of Europe is a 47-member organization that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The UK will take over the chairmanship of the organization in November. Clarke's comments come after a number of high-profile cases in which the court has ruled against the UK government. In 2012, the court ruled that the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting was unlawful. In 2014, the court ruled that the UK government had failed to protect the rights of a man who was killed by police. The government has argued that these rulings show that the court is out of touch with the British public. However, Clarke said the government should not simply withdraw from the court, but should instead work to reform it from within. He said: “We have been too quick to condemn the court. We should now focus on reforming it from within. The UK has a long history of upholding human rights and the rule of law. We should be at the forefront of efforts to strengthen the European Court of Human Rights.” Clarke's comments were welcomed by human rights groups. Amnesty International UK said: “Ken Clarke is right to say that the UK should not simply withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights. The court plays a vital role in protecting human rights across Europe.” Liberty said: “We welcome Ken Clarke's commitment to reforming the European Court of Human Rights. The court is an essential part of the UK's human rights framework and we will work with the government to ensure that it remains effective.”",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pensioner liable for Donald Trump golf court expenses,"US tycoon Mr Trump hopes to build the ""world's greatest golf resort"" at Menie, north of Aberdeen. Molly Forbes, 86, and her 84-year-old husband Ian live in a modest stone-built cottage next door to the proposed site of the luxury development. The couple has been told they could face a legal bill of up to £100,000 after formally objecting to Mr Trump's plans. They are among 12 people who have lodged challenges with the Scottish government against the development. The Forbeses say they cannot afford the legal costs they have already incurred and have appealed for financial help. They fear they could lose their home if they are forced to pay the full amount. ""We're terrified,"" said Mrs Forbes. ""We don't know where we're going to find that sort of money. We've never had to pay legal fees before."" The Forbeses are not the only ones facing potential legal costs. Another objector, David Milne, has already been ordered to pay £15,000 in costs after losing a legal challenge against Mr Trump. Mr Milne, a retired teacher, said he was ""disgusted"" by the prospect of having to pay such a large sum of money. ""It's a disgrace,"" he said. ""I'm just an ordinary guy who was trying to stand up for what I believe in. I shouldn't be punished for that."" Mr Trump has defended his legal action against his opponents, saying he is entitled to protect his business interests. ""These people are trying to stop me from building a world-class golf resort,"" he said. ""I'm not going to let them get away with it."" The Scottish government is currently considering the objections to Mr Trump's plans. A decision is expected later this year. If the plans are approved, the Forbeses will be forced to sell their cottage and move out. They say they have no idea where they will go. ""We've lived here for 50 years,"" said Mrs Forbes. ""It's our home. We don't want to leave.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
City of Culture: Leicester 'disappointed but defiant',"A ""desperately disappointed"" Peter Soulsby congratulated Hull and said it perhaps needed the regeneration more. He said he had previously believed Leicester was not up for the bid but had been proved wrong in ""the most extraordinary way."" The ""heartbroken"" Labour leader said: ""I am proud of the campaign that we have run. We have made history in Leicester. When I started out, I didn't believe that Leicester was up for this bid. I have been proved wrong in the most extraordinary way. ""The people of Leicester have shown what wonderful, warm-hearted, delightful and aspirational people they are. We have come together as a city and as a county as never before. ""I wish Hull all the very best and I hope that this will indeed be the start of a renaissance for that great city. ""Hull clearly needed - perhaps more than we did - the regeneration, the renaissance and the boost that this title has brought. And I am absolutely certain that they will make a great job of it. I hope that they will take the crown with good grace and I wish them well."" Sir Peter, who admitted he felt ""heartbroken"" and ""let down"", said that despite not winning the contest, Leicester's campaign had brought the city together. He said: ""Let us stay together in this unity and this spirit of co-operation that we have found over this campaign period. We have shown what we can do. ""Let's resolve to go on and make this a better city, a great city for everybody to live in."" Leicester's bid featured plans for a huge Diwali festival, transforming the city into a ""beacon of light"" and a ""model of diversity"". There were also plans for a 120-metre high ""Helix"" sculpture, a seven-day ""River of Light"" festival, a new Shakespeare centre and a new ""cultural quarter"" in the city centre. The city's bid had the support of celebrities including Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri, comedian Ross Noble and Take That star Gary Barlow. It had also been backed by the county council and local businesses. Leicester's bid was one of six shortlisted for the title, alongside Hull, Dundee, Perth, Swansea Bay and the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft area. Hull was eventually crowned as the winner of the title, with its bid promising a ""once-in-a-lifetime transformation"" of the city.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ex-officers rehired: Case studies,"The PSNI said the appropriate place to discuss the detail of the report was with the Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee. Here are some case studies of ex-officers who were rehired: Case study 1 An officer was dismissed in 2012 for gross misconduct after being found to have engaged in sexual activity with a vulnerable person. The officer was rehired in 2014 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in a non-operational role. Case study 2 An officer was dismissed in 2015 for misconduct after being found to have used excessive force. The officer was rehired in 2016 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in an operational role. Case study 3 An officer was dismissed in 2017 for misconduct after being found to have breached the code of conduct. The officer was rehired in 2018 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in a non-operational role. The PSNI said that all three of these officers were rehired after a thorough review of their cases. The PSNI said that it was satisfied that the officers had taken steps to address the issues that led to their dismissal and that they were now suitable to return to work. The Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee have both expressed concerns about the PSNI's decision to rehire these officers. The Policing Board has said that it is ""not satisfied"" with the PSNI's explanation for the rehirings. The Public Accounts Committee has said that it will be ""scrutinising"" the PSNI's decision-making process. The PSNI has defended its decision to rehire these officers, saying that it is committed to giving people a second chance. The PSNI has also said that it believes that these officers can make a positive contribution to policing in Northern Ireland. The issue of ex-officers being rehired is likely to continue to be a source of debate. The Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee are both likely to continue to press the PSNI for more information about its decision-making process.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Kent's festivals set to draw large crowds this summer,"By Andrew Parry BBC Kent In fact, we have more festivals than most down in the sunny south-east. From farms to parks, hills to zoos, no large space of land is safe from festival fever. Lounge on the Farm kicks off the main festival season in the county. Set in the beautiful surroundings of Merton Farm in Maidstone, it offers not only a great range of live music but also an array of street food and craft stalls. The week after Lounge, hip-hop will be taking over the Dreamland amusement park in Margate as part of Margate Soul Weekender. The three-day event will feature dozens of live acts, soul-star DJs, live art and street food. More music will follow just a week or so later at Folkestone Fringe, a scaled-down version of the town's much-loved Folkestone Book Festival, which takes place in the autumn. Music and comedy have always been a major part of Folkestone Fringe, but this year there will be plenty of other entertainment too, including science talks, nature walks and life drawing. If laughter is what you're after, then the Canterbury Festival is hosting a lineup of comedians as part of its annual month-long celebration of the arts. Taking place at venues across the city, the festival is once again promising a varied and exciting program of shows to suit all tastes. Not far from Canterbury is the small town of Tenterden, which is set to hold its first-ever Tenterden Folk Festival. Set in the beautiful gardens of Tenterden Recreation Ground, the one-day festival will welcome a variety of folk acts, as well as street food stalls and a real ale bar. This summer will also see the 20th anniversary of Hop Farm Festival. Taking place at the Hop Farm Country Park in Paddock Wood, it's one of the UK's biggest music festivals. This year's lineup includes acts such as McFly, The Fratellis and Rudimental. Away from the music, there will be comedy, street theatre, circus skills, family entertainment and a whole host of food stalls. And finally, for those who like their festivals with a touch of history, Dover Castle is hosting its first-ever Castle Concerts event. Taking place across three nights in August, the concerts will feature classical music, jazz and folk, with performances taking place in the castle's historic setting.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sunday Times Rich List suggests UK's wealthiest defy recession,"The newspaper's research found the combined worth of the country's 1,000 wealthiest people is £414bn, up 4.7%. It means their joint wealth has passed the level last seen in 2008, before the financial crisis, and is 25% above its level a decade ago. The Sunday Times Rich List attributes much of the surge in wealth to the performance of the stock market during the pandemic, which has lifted the value of many businesses. The list's compiler, Robert Watts, said: ""The stock market has been the big driver this year. Those with big share portfolios have done very well indeed."" The biggest winner on the list is James Dyson, the inventor and owner of the eponymous vacuum cleaner company. His wealth has increased by £3.2bn to £23bn, making him the richest person in the UK for the first time. Dyson is followed on the list by brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, whose wealth has increased by £2.4bn to £21.5bn, and Sir Len Blavatnik, whose wealth has increased by £2.3bn to £20bn. The Sunday Times Rich List also highlights the growing wealth of those in the technology sector. The co-founders of online supermarket Ocado, Tim Steiner and Jason Gissing, have seen their wealth increase by a combined £1.3bn to £3.3bn. Meanwhile, the wealth of Alex Chesterman, the founder of property website Zoopla, has increased by £1bn to £2.5bn. Despite the overall increase in wealth, the number of billionaires in the UK has fallen from 171 last year to 147 this year. This is due in part to the falling value of sterling against other currencies, particularly the US dollar. The Sunday Times Rich List is a snapshot of the wealth of the UK's richest people at a particular point in time. It is important to note that wealth can fluctuate over time, and the rankings can change accordingly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'500 killed' due to medicine shortage,"In a letter to the Secretary of Health Ministry, Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi say that the region was not provided with much needed medicine. They say that due to this shortage, around 500 people have died in the last six months. The letter states that Kilinochchi Teaching Hospital alone records about 125,000 patients annually and it is estimated that about 30% of those patients are in need of life-saving medicines. However, the hospital has been facing a severe shortage of essential medicines for the past few months. The letter also says that the Mullaitivu General Hospital has also been facing a similar shortage of medicines, and as a result, many patients are being forced to travel to other districts to get the treatment they need. The Regional Directors of Health Services have urged the Health Ministry to take immediate action to address the shortage of medicines in the region. The Health Ministry has not yet responded to the letter. In a separate development, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) has also expressed concern about the shortage of medicines in the country. The SLMA says that the shortage is due to a number of factors, including the government's failure to pay its debts to pharmaceutical companies, the global economic crisis, and the war in Ukraine. The SLMA has called on the government to take immediate action to address the shortage of medicines, as it is putting the lives of patients at risk. The shortage of medicines in Sri Lanka is a serious problem that needs to be addressed segera. The government must take immediate action to ensure that all patients have access to the medicines they need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
University of Nottingham rent protesters offered 'support package',"Hundreds of University of Nottingham students called for rents to be suspended when they were unable to return due to national restrictions. Now the university has said support will be available to some. The university has announced a ""support package"" which will include a rent rebate for students who were unable to return to halls of residence during the November and December national lockdown and a hardship fund for those who are struggling to pay their rent. The rent rebate will be for the 11 weeks of the November and December lockdown and will be paid to students who were unable to return to halls of residence during that period. The hardship fund will be available to students who are struggling to pay their rent, regardless of whether they were able to return to halls of residence during the lockdown. The university said it had made the decision after listening to feedback from students and the Students' Union. The Students' Union said it welcomed the ""positive steps"" the university had taken but said it would continue to push for rent to be suspended for all students. The university said it was committed to supporting its students during the pandemic and would continue to monitor the situation and make changes to its support package as necessary. The announcement of the support package comes after months of campaigning by students for rent suspensions. In November, over 1,000 students signed a petition calling for rents to be suspended. The Students' Union also held a series of protests, including a rent strike. The university has said it hopes the support package will help students who are struggling financially during this difficult time. It is important to note that this support package is not available to all students.

Covid anxiety: Child 'asking if he's going to die',"By Sarah Easedale BBC Wales news Jane Griffiths, 47, said her four children had all been affected by the stress of the pandemic. ""My eldest two haven't shown any obvious signs of anxiety but our two youngest have been very affected,"" she said. ""My youngest says 'is it going to kill me?' and if I cough or sneeze he runs in fear."" Mrs Griffiths, from Mold, Flintshire, says they, like many families, have been through a lot of upheaval in the past year with all four children being off school for months and not seeing their friends. ""But I do also think there seems to be a lot of scaremongering out there about Covid and that has fuelled their fears,"" she added. ""My husband is a nurse and despite all the reassurances he gives them, they still worry."" Emma Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, is a single mum to nine-year-old Mia. She said her daughter - who has type 1 diabetes - had become very anxious during the pandemic, with her blood sugar levels rising as a result. ""Mia's blood sugar levels are usually very stable but when she started to get anxious we saw her blood sugars start to rise and we had to increase her insulin,"" she said. ""She's also started asking questions like 'mum, am I going to get Covid?' and 'am I going to die?' and it's heartbreaking as I'm trying to reassure her but also have to be mindful of not dismissing her concerns."" She added: ""I feel her anxiety has been fed by the media. I have a lot of friends who work in the NHS and I know it's been really tough but I don't think all of the reporting reflects that."" Dr Nicola Davies, consultant clinical psychologist for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said children's anxiety had been amplified by the pandemic. ""Many children and young people are anxious about the pandemic and how it's affecting their lives and those around them,"" she said. ""Some children may also experience physical symptoms such as stomach aches and headaches. It's important for parents and carers to take their child's worries seriously and to reassure them that they are safe."" Dr Davies said parents and carers can help children cope with anxiety by: Talking to them about their concerns and answering their questions honestly and reassuringly Helping them to develop coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques Limiting their exposure to news and social media about the pandemic Seeking professional help if their anxiety is severe or persistent If you are concerned about your child's mental health, you can contact your GP or local CAMHS team.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Power at Fukushima nuclear fuel ponds restored,"A power cut shut down cooling systems for four spent fuel ponds at reactors 1, 3 and 4 on Monday evening, although cooling was restored two hours later. This is the latest in a series of problems since the massive earthquake and tsunami of 2011 destroyed the plant's cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), said the power outage was caused by a fault with an electrical switch. A Tepco spokesman said the switch was damaged in the 2011 disaster and had been replaced, but still malfunctioned. He said the company was investigating the cause of the failure and working to prevent a recurrence. The ponds are not currently leaking and there is no immediate threat to the public, Tepco said. The ponds contain used fuel rods, which generate heat even after they have been removed from the reactors. The rods are covered with water to keep them cool and prevent them from overheating. If the water level were to drop too low, the rods could be exposed to air, which could cause them to catch fire. The power cut lasted for about two hours, and cooling was restored at all four ponds by 21:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Tepco admitted that it had allowed safety standards to slip in the months leading up to the 2011 disaster, which killed nearly 16,000 people. Following the 2011 disaster, the plant was closed and its operator, Tepco, has been struggling to decommission it. The plant is so badly damaged that it is expected to take decades to decommission, and the cost is expected to reach tens of billions of dollars. In the meantime, the vast majority of the plant's 26,000 spent fuel rods remain in cooling ponds, which are themselves vulnerable to earthquakes and other natural disasters. The power cut at the plant highlights the ongoing challenges of decommissioning the plant and the importance of ensuring the safety of the spent fuel rods.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Macedonia parliament votes to start name change process,"Two-thirds of the chamber - 80 of 120 deputies - backed the start of the process, the requisite majority to start the move. Several more votes will be needed before the changes can be ratified, including a public referendum. The move is the culmination of years of negotiations between Macedonia and Greece, which has long objected to its neighbour using the name Macedonia, arguing that it implies territorial claims over its own northern province of the same name. The agreement has been hailed by many as a major breakthrough in relations between the two countries, and could pave the way for Macedonia to join the EU and NATO. However, it has also been met with opposition from some Macedonians, who argue that it amounts to a betrayal of their national identity. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who has staked his political future on the deal, said it was a ""historic day"" for Macedonia. ""We are opening a new chapter in our history,"" he said. ""We are building a new future for our children."" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also welcomed the vote, saying it was a ""victory for Europe"". ""This is a historic day for our region,"" he said. ""We are overcoming the divisions of the past and building a better future for all our citizens."" The name change process is expected to take several months to complete. Once it is ratified by the Macedonian parliament and approved in a referendum, it will need to be recognised by the United Nations and other international organisations. The deal has been met with mixed reactions from the international community. The United States and the European Union have welcomed the agreement, but Russia has expressed concerns that it could lead to instability in the region. The name change process is likely to be a complex and challenging one. However, if it is successful, it could have a major impact on the future of Macedonia and the wider Balkans region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
What has the UK accomplished in Afghanistan?,"By Caroline Wyatt Defence correspondent, BBC News This has been the case since George Bush declared America's mission in Iraq over, under a banner that proclaimed 'Mission Accomplished'. The Taliban, Afghanistan's former rulers, seized control of much of the country again just 11 days after the US and UK finally withdrew their remaining 2,500 troops. The then US President Joe Biden said that America's mission was not to nation-build, but to ""take down al-Qaeda and to deal with terrorism"". And that, he insisted, had been achieved. The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK's aims in Afghanistan had been achieved too - they were to help the US with its counter-terror mission and to support the Afghan government and train the Afghan army. But while the US and UK have succeeded in removing the Taliban from power for 20 years - and in killing al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden - it is clear from the Taliban's swift return to power that there is still much that remains unfinished. What did the UK achieve in Afghanistan? The UK has been heavily involved in the US-led intervention in Afghanistan for the past two decades. The UK has deployed more than 45,000 troops to Afghanistan since 2001, and has spent more than £40bn on the war effort. The UK's main objectives in Afghanistan have been to: Help the US to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda Help to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan Train and support the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) The UK has made some progress in achieving these objectives. The Taliban was removed from power in 2001, and the UK has helped to build a number of schools and hospitals in Afghanistan. The UK has also trained and supported the ANSF. However, the Taliban has remained a potent force in Afghanistan, and the country has remained unstable. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 has raised questions about the long-term impact of the UK's intervention in the country. It is too early to say what the long-term impact of the UK's intervention in Afghanistan will be. However, it is clear that the UK has not achieved all of its objectives in Afghanistan. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan has been criticized by some. Critics argue that the UK's withdrawal has left a vacuum that the Taliban has been able to fill. They also argue that the UK's withdrawal has left the Afghan people vulnerable to the Taliban. The UK government has defended its decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. The UK government argues that the UK's objectives in Afghanistan have been achieved, and that it is now time for the Afghan people to take responsibility for their own country.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New prostate therapy recommended on NHS,"New prostate therapy recommended on NHS It's called prostate artery embolisation. And it blocks some of the blood supply to the prostate using tiny synthetic beads, causing the troublesome tissue to shrink and die. Officials say there is ""good evidence"" the new treatment can relieve symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate, such as problems urinating and needing to go to the toilet frequently. It is recommended for men who aren't suitable for surgery or other treatments, including medication. Prostate artery embolisation (PAE) is carried out under local anaesthetic, usually as a day procedure. A fine tube, called a catheter, is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded to the prostate. Tiny beads are then released into blood vessels supplying the prostate. The procedure takes about an hour and most people can go home the same day. Around a third of men over 50 experience problems urinating because of an enlarged prostate, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Symptoms include: needing to urinate more often, including at night difficulty starting to urinate a weak flow dribbling after urinating a feeling that the bladder isn't fully empty after urinating Most men with BPH can manage their symptoms with medication. But for those who don't respond to drugs, or who have side-effects, surgery has been the main option. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says PAE is a ""clinically and cost-effective option"" for these men. The health body said it was ""less invasive"" than surgery, and was associated with ""shorter hospital stays, less pain and fewer complications"". ""Around 75% of men treated with PAE report an improvement in their symptoms,"" Nice said. ""It is recommended for men for whom surgery is not an option or who prefer a less invasive treatment."" The treatment is not suitable for men with certain conditions, such as prostate cancer or a urinary tract infection. It is also not recommended for men with a very large prostate. PAE is also not yet widely available on the NHS, although Nice says it should be offered to all eligible men. The treatment costs around £2,500 privately. Prostate Cancer UK welcomed the recommendation, saying it was ""great news"" for men with BPH. ""For many men, medication is enough to manage their symptoms, but until now surgery was the only real alternative for those whose symptoms are severe or don't respond to drugs,"" said the charity's head of research, Dr Matthew Hobbs. ""PAE could offer a minimally invasive, day-case procedure that can significantly improve symptoms in many of these men, without the need for major surgery.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

China and US 'agree North Korea nuclear test measures',"Unnamed diplomats said a deal was agreed late on Monday and they hoped a draft resolution would be put to the Security Council for a vote on Tuesday. The new resolution is expected to limit North Korea's ability to import oil, ban its exports of textiles and impose sanctions on individuals and companies linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The text has yet to be released but, according to diplomats, the new measures would cut North Korea's crude oil imports by about one third. The country currently relies on China for nearly all of its oil, so cutting those imports would be a significant blow to its economy. The resolution would also ban North Korea from exporting textiles, which is one of its main sources of revenue. In addition, it would impose sanctions on individuals and companies linked to the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The agreement comes after months of negotiations between the US and China. China is North Korea's closest ally and has been reluctant to impose tough sanctions that could destabilize the regime in Pyongyang. However, Beijing has come under increasing pressure from the US and its other allies to take action following North Korea's recent nuclear and missile tests. The new resolution is expected to be met with resistance from North Korea, which has vowed to continue developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, diplomats said they hoped the measures would send a strong message to Pyongyang that its actions will not be tolerated. The agreement between the US and China is a significant breakthrough, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to deter North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests. Only time will tell how effective the new sanctions will be in curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Removing school bus chaperones in Birmingham 'dangerous',"Some pupils who used the free council bus service with guides to the Wilson Stuart School in Birmingham were told they would no longer have the same level of support and would have to make their own way to school. The decision to remove the chaperones was made by Birmingham City Council in a bid to save money. However, parents and pupils have expressed concerns about the safety of children having to travel alone. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""I'm really worried about my child having to get the bus to school on their own. They are only 11 years old and I don't think they are mature enough to do it safely."" Pupils have also expressed concerns, with one saying: ""I don't feel safe getting the bus to school on my own. There are often older children on the bus who bully me."" The council has defended its decision, saying that it is necessary to save money and that the pupils will be safe. A council spokesperson said: ""We understand that some parents and pupils are concerned about the removal of chaperones, but we believe that the pupils will be safe. We have carried out a risk assessment and we are confident that the pupils will be able to travel to school safely on their own."" However, the council's decision has been met with criticism from some quarters, with one councillor saying: ""I think it's a dangerous decision. I'm worried that children are going to get hurt.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rainfall not seen for a quarter of a century. ""It is certainly remarkable,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""The fact that it is the sunniest May on record is pretty exceptional because May is not normally a particularly sunny month, especially compared to June and July."" The extreme sunshine has been driven by a combination of high pressure and clear skies over the UK. And while the weather might have brought cheer for many, it has also heightened concerns about the impacts of climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1C since the industrial revolution, mostly as a result of human activities that emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. And climate scientists say that as the world continues to warm, the UK and other countries should expect further extremes in weather, with heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms becoming more frequent and severe. The Met Office says that ""under a high emissions scenario"", May's record sunshine could be the norm by the end of the century. ""If we don't do anything and we continue as we are, then what we would have perceived as extreme as the record sunshine in May could be our new normal,"" said Mike Kendon, a climate scientist at the Met Office. And it is not just in the UK that extreme weather events are occurring. A series of heatwaves in India and Pakistan have killed hundreds of people and have led to concerns about water shortages. While in the US, the state of California is battling its largest wildfire on record, which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the worsening climate crisis as ""a code red for humanity"". And he called on governments to ""sound the alarm"" and take urgent action to address the issue. The UK government is due to host a major UN climate summit in November, which is likely to be a battleground between countries that are demanding bolder action and those most resistant to change.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Trump aide Michael Flynn Jnr out after 'Pizzagate' tweets,"Michael Flynn, 33, left the US president-elect's transition team on Tuesday following his tweets about the so-called Pizzagate fake news story. His father, Michael Flynn Snr, Mr Trump's pick to be US national security adviser, has also shared viral Pizzagate content on social media. Pizzagate originated as a conspiracy theory that a Washington pizzeria was a front for a child sex trafficking ring run by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta. The theory spread widely on social media during the election campaign, and a North Carolina man travelled to the pizzeria in December and fired an AR-15 rifle inside, because he believed the conspiracy theory was true. Michael Flynn Jnr's Pizzagate tweets prompted the New York Police Department to post a warning on social media about the ""fictitious and unsubstantiated"" claims about child trafficking. The White House did not immediately comment on Michael Flynn Jnr's departure, but Mr Trump responded to the controversy on Twitter on Tuesday. He wrote: ""Michael Flynn Jr. - despite having an outstanding public record - is being treated very unfairly by the media. I failed to do a proper background check, therefore he is out."" Michael Flynn Jnr's departure marks the latest in a series of high-profile departures from Mr Trump's team. His chief strategist Steve Bannon, a key figure in the president-elect's inner circle, was forced to resign last week. Mr Trump's pick for labour secretary, Andrew Puzder, also withdrew his nomination on Tuesday. The controversies surrounding Michael Flynn Jnr and others have raised questions about Mr Trump's ability to staff his administration. He has repeatedly said he wants to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, but his picks for key positions have included several figures with controversial backgrounds.

Yardie actor on Idris Elba proposal: I had tears in my eyes,"By Hannah Moore Newsbeat reporter The 21-year-old has said he was already overwhelmed with emotion to be at the screening of Yardie - and that's before Idris made a special appearance. ""I was in the screening and it was a really emotional watch - I had tears in my eyes,"" said Aml Ameen, who plays the titular character D in the film. ""I remember turning around and seeing Idris standing at the back in a cap, so I thought: 'He's here, that's cool.' And then he was like, 'Come on stage.'"" After the screening, the audience was treated to a Q&A with Elba and the cast, where Elba revealed he'd asked Ameen to marry him. ""When he said that I just turned around and looked at him and I just kind of hugged him and said: 'Yes',"" Ameen told Newsbeat. ""We kind of joked about it on set. It wasn't like a serious thing, but then he did it and it was amazing. It was just so natural."" Elba and Ameen have known each other for years, having worked together on the TV series Luther. ""I'd always wanted to work with him and I always wanted to play a character that he created,"" said Ameen. ""I've been a fan of his for so long, so to actually work with him and then for him to be so gracious as to share this moment with me - it meant the world."" Yardie is a crime drama set in 1970s Kingston, Jamaica, and London. It follows the story of D, who travels to London to avenge his brother's murder. The film has been praised for its authentic portrayal of Jamaican culture and its exploration of themes such as violence, masculinity and redemption. Ameen said he was drawn to the role of D because of its complexity. ""He's a very layered character,"" he said. ""He's a very violent man, but he's also very loving and caring. He's a very complex character and I was really interested in exploring that."" Ameen said he hopes Yardie will resonate with audiences around the world. ""It's a very universal story,"" he said. ""It's about love, loss, redemption and family. I think it's a story that everyone can relate to.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Officials probe Missouri governor for 'blackmail and assault',"The spurned ex-husband of the woman, who has not been named in reports, secretly recorded her describing the otherwise consensual encounter. On Thursday, the man added that Mr Greitens had ""slapped her"" after she told him she had slept with another man. The House Special Investigative Committee on Oversight was convened to probe allegations of ""potential wrongdoing"" by Greitens. A spokesperson for the committee declined to provide details about the investigation. The woman filed for divorce from her husband in 2015, citing ""irreconcilable differences."" The woman sought and received a restraining order against her ex-husband in May 2016, alleging that he had physically abused her. In the divorce case, the woman's ex-husband alleged that his wife was having an affair with Mr Greitens. The woman, who was represented by an attorney, denied these allegations. The divorce was finalized in October 2016. In January 2017, Mr Greitens announced that he was running for Governor of Missouri. He was elected in November 2016. In March 2018, the woman's ex-husband released the audio recordings of his ex-wife describing her encounter with Mr Greitens to the media. The woman's ex-husband said that he released the recordings because he was concerned about Mr Greitens' behavior. In a statement, Mr Greitens called the allegations ""outrageous"" and ""false"" and said that he would ""not be extorted or blackmailed."" The allegations against Mr Greitens are the latest in a series of controversies that have plagued his administration. In April 2018, he was accused of misusing a charity for political purposes. He has also been criticized for his handling of a deadly tornado in Joplin, Missouri. The allegations against Mr Greitens have led to calls for his resignation. The Missouri House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry, and the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office is also investigating the allegations. Mr Greitens has denied any wrongdoing and has said that he will not resign. The investigation into the allegations against Mr Greitens is ongoing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jimmy Carr faces crowd after tax furore,"Carr has been widely condemned for taking part in a tax avoidance scheme. In response to a heckler who called him a ""tax dodger"", he replied: ""I've got to take that, I'm afraid. I've not paid tax for many years and there's nothing you can do about it. Get over it."" Carr's admission drew a mixed reaction from the audience. Some booed and hissed, while others laughed and applauded. One audience member shouted: ""You should be ashamed of yourself."" Carr has since defended his decision to use the tax avoidance scheme, saying that he did so ""entirely legally"". He has also said that he pays ""a lot of tax"" in other ways. However, his comments have been met with widespread criticism. Tax avoidance is a controversial issue in the UK, and many people believe that it is unfair for wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Carr's admission has also raised questions about the morality of comedians. Some people believe that comedians have a responsibility to use their platform to speak out against injustice, while others believe that comedians should not get involved in politics. Carr's decision to use the tax avoidance scheme is likely to continue to be debated for some time to come. It is a complex issue with no easy answers, and it is ultimately up to each individual to decide where they stand on the matter. In the meantime, Carr is continuing to perform his stand-up comedy shows. He is due to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this summer, and he is also set to embark on a UK tour in the autumn. It remains to be seen whether his tax avoidance admission will have any impact on his career. Only time will tell.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Files released on 1974 'Welsh Roswell',"There was a huge bang and a brilliant light over the Berwyn Mountains in north east Wales, and there were later claims a spaceship crash was concealed. Comparisons were drawn with Roswell, New Mexico, USA, in 1947, where it is alleged that alien bodies were recovered after a crash. The so-called ""Welsh Roswell"" incident took place in the early hours of 23 January 1974. Many people in the area reported seeing a bright light, some of whom also heard a loud bang. The incident was investigated by the police, who could find no evidence of a crash. However, some people believe that evidence of a crash was covered up by the authorities. In 2008, a new witness came forward to claim that he had seen a crashed spaceship being transported away from the Berwyn Mountains on the back of a low-loader. This witness, who has remained anonymous, said that he saw the spaceship being taken away from the mountains towards RAF Wrexham. The MOD has denied any involvement in the incident. However, some people believe that the MOD is still covering up the truth about what happened in the Berwyn Mountains in 1974. In 2014, a group of UFO researchers conducted an investigation into the Welsh Roswell incident. The group, known as the Welsh UFO Research Group, concluded that there was ""compelling evidence"" to suggest that a UFO had crashed in the Berwyn Mountains. The Welsh UFO Research Group based its conclusions on interviews with witnesses, as well as an examination of physical evidence. The group said that it had found ""pieces of metal and other debris"" that were ""consistent with the wreckage of a UFO."" The MOD has dismissed the findings of the Welsh UFO Research Group. However, the group's report has renewed interest in the Welsh Roswell incident. The Welsh Roswell incident remains one of the most famous UFO cases in British history. Despite the MOD's denials, many people believe that a UFO crashed in the Berwyn Mountains in 1974.

Amnesty calls for GCHQ spying inquiry,"It said it was ""outrageous"" that human rights bodies were being monitored. It came after the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) informed Amnesty that GCHQ had breached rules by keeping data intercepted from a secure communications network for longer than necessary. The tribunal ruled it had ""no doubt that the retention of the metadata for so long was incompatible with the law"". The tribunal's report follows a three-year legal battle by Amnesty to force the government to reveal the extent of its surveillance operations. Amnesty said the IPT's findings were ""deeply troubling"" and called for a full public inquiry into GCHQ's spying activities. ""It is outrageous that human rights organisations are being targeted by the British government,"" said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK's director. ""This is not just about Amnesty, this is about the right of all of us to privacy and to freedom of expression. ""The government must now come clean about the extent of its surveillance operations and establish an independent public inquiry into GCHQ."" The IPT's report found that GCHQ had intercepted communications between Amnesty staff and activists, and had stored the data for up to two years. The tribunal said that GCHQ had breached the law by keeping the data for so long, as it was only allowed to retain intercepted data for 60 days. The government said it was ""disappointed"" by the IPT's ruling, but accepted its findings. A government spokesman said: ""The Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled that GCHQ breached the rules in relation to the retention of metadata. ""We are disappointed by this ruling, but we accept it and have already taken steps to address the issue.

Oculus anti-piracy update cracked in a day,"The update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device. It also breaks an unofficial patch called Revive, which allowed users to play Rift-exclusive games on their HTC Vive or Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Within a day of the update's release, a group of hackers released a new version of Revive that bypasses the anti-piracy measures. The new version of Revive allows users to continue playing Rift-exclusive games on their non-Oculus headsets. The Oculus anti-piracy update is a significant development in the VR industry. It is the first time that a major VR headset manufacturer has implemented an anti-piracy measure. The update is likely to have a significant impact on the piracy of VR games, but it is unlikely to stop piracy altogether. The release of a cracked version of the update so quickly after its release is a testament to the skill and determination of the hacking community. It is also a reminder that no anti-piracy measure is foolproof. The Oculus anti-piracy update is a controversial development. Some users have praised the update, arguing that it is necessary to protect the VR industry from piracy. Others have criticized the update, arguing that it is too restrictive and that it will harm the VR community. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the Oculus anti-piracy update remains to be seen. It is likely that the update will reduce the piracy of VR games, but it is unlikely to stop piracy altogether.

Labour/Tory deal at Stirling Council ousts SNP,"Both parties said their priority would be balancing the local authority's books over the next two years. The deal comes despite the SNP returning nine councillors at last week's local election compared to Labour's seven and the Tories' six. The total number of seats in the chamber was reduced from 23 to 22 following boundary changes. Stirling Council is facing a financial challenge, having already made significant cuts to its budget in recent years. The new SNP/Tory administration is likely to continue this trend, as the council looks to reduce its reliance on government grants. The deal has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the move, arguing that it will bring stability to the council at a time of financial uncertainty. Others have criticised the agreement, saying it is a betrayal of the voters who elected the SNP as the largest party. The SNP has been in power in Stirling since 2007, but its support has declined in recent years. The party lost four seats at the local election, while Labour gained three and the Tories one. The SNP's vote share also fell by 4.4% to 34.9%. The SNP's losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the party's handling of the Scottish independence referendum and its performance in government. The party has also been criticised for its lack of focus on local issues. The Labour/Tory deal is a significant development in Scottish politics. It is the first time that these two parties have worked together in a formal coalition at a local level. It remains to be seen whether the deal will be successful, but it is a sign that the Scottish political landscape is changing. In the wake of the election, the SNP has pledged to continue to hold the new administration to account. The party has also said that it will be working to regain the trust of voters in Stirling.

The duchess started with the official opening of Te Papaiouru, a new $27 (£16.5m) museum in Wellington. The museum tells the story of New Zealand's democracy. It was built to mark 125 years since women won the right to vote in New Zealand. This gives the country a claim to being the first self-governing country in the world to give women the vote. Speaking at the event Meghan said: ""The achievements of the women of New Zealand 125 years ago was a resounding call to action - not just here in New Zealand but across the world."" These sentiments were echoed by her husband, who attended the ceremony with her. The couple also laid a wreath at the Kate Sheppard Memorial.

Thai Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn leads bike ride 'for Mom',"Wearing shirts in the queen's colour - sky-blue - and emblazoned with ""Bike for Mom"", the cyclists paraded through streets closed to traffic. Many Thais outside the capital were expected to gather for similar events. Bicycle clubs around the country, from Chiang Mai in the north to Songkhla in the south, held rides to show loyalty to the king's mother, who is a keen cyclist herself. Vajiralongkorn, the only son of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, is known for his love of cycling. He has competed in international events and often leads bike rides with the public. He wore sky-blue cycling gear, a helmet and sunglasses, and was surrounded by bodyguards as he waved to the crowds. The queen, 86, is revered by many Thais and is seen as a symbol of unity. She has been treated for several health issues in recent years. The bicycle ride was one of several events held to mark the queen's birthday, which falls on 12 August.

Rajar figures: Radio news listeners fall but boost for music shows,"Today's audience dropped by 839,000 year-on-year, while 5 Live Breakfast was down 337,000, according to Rajar, which monitors UK radio listening. The BBC said a quieter news agenda in the second quarter may have contributed to the fall, as there were fewer major breaking stories compared with the same period last year. Despite the drop in news audiences, there was a boost for music shows, with Radio 1's Breakfast Show with Greg James gaining 128,000 listeners. Radio 2's Breakfast Show with Zoe Ball also saw a rise of 94,000, while Scott Mills' show on Radio 1 gained 68,000 listeners. The figures show that commercial radio continues to grow, with Global's Heart remaining the UK's most popular commercial station, with a reach of 8.3 million. Bauer's Absolute Radio also saw a rise in listeners, with a reach of 5.2 million. The Rajar figures also show that podcast listening continues to grow, with a record 12.4 million people now listening to podcasts each week. The most popular podcasts include BBC Sounds' Newscast, Desert Island Discs, and Today in Focus. The Rajar figures are based on a survey of 59,000 people aged 15 and over, and are considered to be the industry standard for measuring radio listenership in the UK.

Culture secretary questions Edinburgh tourist tax plans,"The council says adding a £1 charge to hotel guests' bills could raise £11m to fund local services in Edinburgh. Leader Adam McVey posted on Twitter: ""Our plans for a transient visitor levy could raise an estimated £11m each year, which would be ring-fenced for new or improved local services to help tackle the additional visitor pressures our city faces."" However, the plans have been met with criticism from some in the tourism industry. ""The Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) last year called on the authority to abandon its proposed tourist tax after more than 500 hoteliers and hospitality businesses responded to a consultation,"" the BBC reports. ""The STA said the results showed 86% of businesses rejected the idea, with just 14% in favour of it."" Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government wants to ""understand the implications of a transient visitor levy"", but added that she has ""some concerns"".

""Edinburgh is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and we need to make sure that we don't do anything that would damage that."" Hyslop said she is ""also concerned about the impact on low-income visitors"". ""I think it's important that we have a fair and equitable system that doesn't disproportionately impact on those who are less well-off,"" she said. The Scottish government is currently considering a range of options for funding local services in tourist destinations.

ExpressTest's CEO, David Evans, said: ""We are delighted to be working with Edinburgh Airport to provide this new testing service. We believe that testing is essential for safe travel, and we are committed to providing our customers with fast, accurate and affordable testing options."" The opening of the screening site at Edinburgh Airport comes after the Scottish government announced a number of other measures to increase testing capacity for international travellers. These measures include: The launch of a new online booking system for PCR tests, which will allow passengers to book their tests in advance and avoid queues at airports. The expansion of testing capacity at Glasgow and Aberdeen airports. The introduction of new testing requirements for passengers arriving from countries with high levels of Covid-19. The Scottish government has also announced that it is working with the UK government to develop a new ""traffic light"" system for international travel. Under this system, countries will be placed on a red, amber or green list, depending on their Covid-19 risk level. Passengers arriving from red list countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while passengers arriving from amber list countries will be required to self-isolate at home for 10 days. Passengers arriving from green list countries will not be required to quarantine or self-isolate. The Scottish government has said that it is hopeful that the new testing and quarantine measures will help to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and support the safe restart of international travel.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Depression: 'Mindfulness-based therapy shows promise',"By Smitha Mundasad Health reporter, BBC News Scientists tested it against anti-depressant pills for people at risk of relapse and found mindfulness worked equally well. The study, in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, involved more than 200 people who had recently recovered from a depressive episode. Half of them practised mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) while the others took the antidepressant drug escitalopram, or a placebo. Over 24 months, they found 43% of those who received MBCT relapsed compared with 51% of those on escitalopram and 60% on placebo. Researchers said this meant it could offer people who are struggling with repeat depression a safe alternative to or work alongside medication. Lead author Prof Willem Kuyken, from Oxford University, said: ""MBCT looks to be an important additional treatment for depression relapse prevention. ""Currently there are few psychological treatments that are effective against depression relapse, and those that are can be time-consuming or not widely available. ""MBCT is a transdiagnostic treatment, meaning it can be used to treat and prevent all types of depression."" Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy MBCT is a form of psychotherapy that draws on the principles of mindfulness meditation but is adapted to be focused on depression. It involves group sessions where people sit, walk or lie still to learn how to focus their awareness on the present moment and process their emotions without judgment. Participants are also encouraged to practice mindfulness at home. Prof Kuyken said it was the first study to find MBCT was as effective as medication in preventing depression relapse, but added it was still too early to recommend MBCT as a first-line treatment for everyone with depression. He said: ""People at high risk of depression relapse are likely to prefer to take a pill once a day rather than practise mindfulness. ""But for those who don't want to take medication, or who have not had good experiences of medication, MBCT is a welcome new option."" Other experts said it was important to note the study did not compare MBCT against a talking therapy, so it was difficult to draw definite conclusions about its effectiveness. But Dr Carmine Pariante, a researcher from King's College London, said there was growing evidence that MBCT was effective in preventing depression relapse. ""This is welcome news as it provides an alternative option for people who do not want to take medication, or who have not found medication helpful,"" he said. ""It is also worth noting that MBCT is relatively easy to learn and deliver, so it has the potential to be widely accessible.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Hong Kong 'Umbrella' protesters sentenced to jail terms,"Four others received suspended sentences on Wednesday, while one had their sentencing deferred until June. The nine activists were found guilty earlier this month over their involvement in the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"" pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The movement, which called for greater democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, saw large-scale demonstrations and occupations of major thoroughfares. The nine activists were charged with offenses including conspiracy to commit public nuisance and incitement to unlawful assembly. Benny Tai, an academic and one of the leaders of the movement, was sentenced to 16 months in prison. Two other prominent activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were each sentenced to eight months in prison. The remaining six defendants received sentences ranging from six to eight months. The sentencing of the activists has been widely condemned by human rights groups and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. They argue that the sentences are politically motivated and intended to suppress dissent in the city. The Chinese government has defended the sentences, saying that the activists were convicted of serious crimes and that the sentences were proportionate to their offenses. The sentencing of the activists is likely to further polarize Hong Kong society and increase tensions between the city's pro-democracy movement and the Chinese government. It is also likely to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly in the city. The ""Umbrella Movement"" protests were sparked by the Chinese government's decision to restrict the number of candidates who could run for the city's top post in 2017. The protests lasted for 79 days and at their peak involved more than 100,000 people. The Chinese government has since cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, arresting a number of pro-democracy activists and introducing new laws that restrict freedom of speech and assembly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nearly 100 subsidised bus routes cut in Wales in 2011-14,"The figures obtained by BBC Wales reveal that nearly one in seven routes across 19 council areas have been axed. The charity Age Cymru warned of the impact this could have on older people, saying they could become increasingly isolated. ""A lot of older people rely on buses to access essential services such as health appointments, food shopping and social events,"" said Ian Thomas, Age Cymru's head of policy. ""If there is no bus service, it means people cannot get to these places and are more likely to be cut off from society."" The cuts have also been criticized by the Welsh government, which said they were ""unacceptable."" ""We are committed to improving public transport in Wales, not cutting it,"" said a spokesman for the government. ""We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that everyone has access to affordable and reliable bus services."" The cuts have been blamed on a number of factors, including government funding cuts and the rising cost of fuel. ""We are in a very difficult financial position and have had to make some tough decisions,"" said a spokesman for one council that has cut bus services. ""We have tried to protect the most essential services, but some routes have had to be axed."" The cuts have sparked protests from passengers and community groups. ""We are very angry about these cuts,"" said one protester. ""Buses are a lifeline for many people in our community and we are not going to let them be taken away."" The Welsh government has said it is working with local authorities to find ways to mitigate the impact of the cuts. ""We are exploring a number of options, including providing financial support to bus operators and working with community groups to develop new transport services,"" said a spokesman for the government. The cuts have also raised concerns about the future of public transport in Wales. ""These cuts are a symptom of a deeper problem,"" said one transport expert. ""The Welsh government needs to come up with a long-term plan for public transport that is affordable, reliable and sustainable.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cancer awareness 'low in black and South Asian groups',"By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News The study of nearly 50,000 people found those with a black ethnic background were least likely to have ever had a cancer screening, and men from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of some cancers. Overall, 67% of people in the UK have ever had a cancer screening (not including cervical screening). But the study found just 57% of black respondents had ever had a cancer check, compared with 69% of white respondents. For some cancers - such as testicular, prostate and lung cancer - awareness of the risks was much lower among black and South Asian men compared with white men. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health and patient experience at Cancer Research UK, said the findings showed ""clear disparities in cancer awareness between different ethnic groups"". ""This is concerning, as being aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer can lead to earlier diagnosis, and earlier diagnosis usually leads to better outcomes,"" she said. The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, looked at data from the Health Survey for England, which collected information on cancer screening and awareness from nearly 50,000 adults between 2018 and 2020. The researchers found that black respondents were less likely to have ever had a cancer screening than white respondents, even after taking into account factors such as age, sex, education and socioeconomic status. The study also found that men from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of testicular, prostate and lung cancer than white men. And women from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of cervical, breast and ovarian cancer than white women. Dr Sharp said the reasons for the disparities in cancer awareness were complex, but could include factors such as cultural beliefs, language barriers and a lack of trust in healthcare services. ""It's important to address these disparities so that everyone has the opportunity to be diagnosed with cancer at an early stage when treatment is more likely to be successful,"" she said. Cancer Research UK is calling for more to be done to raise awareness of cancer in black and South Asian communities, and to make sure that everyone has access to high-quality cancer screening and treatment services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Durham neo-Nazi teenager detained for terror attack plan,"The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named due to his age, guilty of preparing for an act of terrorism, possession of explosives and making threats to kill. The boy, who had been obsessed with Hitler and the Nazis, was first arrested in March 2019 when he was aged 15 after police raided his family home in Durham. They found a diary in which he had written about his hatred for black and Asian people and his desire to start a race war. He had also drawn up a list of targets for attacks, including schools, mosques, and synagogues. The boy's parents told police that he had become increasingly withdrawn and isolated in the months leading up to his arrest. He had spent hours alone in his room, playing video games and reading neo-Nazi material. He had also been attending meetings of a far-right group and had made threats to kill people online. In June 2020, the boy was convicted of preparing for an act of terrorism, possession of explosives and making threats to kill. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. The case of the Durham neo-Nazi teenager highlights the growing threat of far-right extremism in the UK. In recent years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of hate crimes committed against ethnic minorities and religious groups. The government has been accused of failing to do enough to tackle the problem. In light of the rise in far-right extremism, the BBC is launching a new series of investigative reports into the threat posed by white supremacists in the UK. The series will examine the factors that drive people to adopt far-right ideologies and will investigate the activities of far-right groups in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Safoora Zargar: Bail for pregnant India student blamed for Delhi riots,"She was more than three months pregnant when she was arrested in April. Police called her a ""key conspirator"" in anti-Muslim riots that swept Delhi in February. She is one of three Muslim women who are facing charges over the unrest, which left more than 50 people dead. All three women are accused of instigating violence, but they deny the charges. Safoora Zargar, a student at Jamia Millia Islamia University, was granted bail on Thursday by Delhi High Court. The court said that there was no evidence to support the charges against her. Her release was welcomed by activists and opposition politicians, who have accused the government of targeting Muslims in its crackdown on the Delhi riots. ""This is a victory for justice and for all those who have been fighting against the Modi government's draconian policies,"" said Umar Khalid, a prominent Muslim activist who was also arrested in connection with the Delhi riots. The government has defended its handling of the riots, saying that it is committed to ensuring that all those responsible are brought to justice. However, critics say that the charges against Safoora Zargar and the other two women are politically motivated. They point out that the government has not arrested any of the Hindu nationalists who are accused of inciting violence against Muslims. The Delhi riots were sparked by protests against a new citizenship law that was seen as discriminatory against Muslims. The protests quickly turned violent, with mobs of Hindu nationalists attacking Muslim homes and businesses. The government has been accused of turning a blind eye to the violence, and even of encouraging it. In the aftermath of the riots, the police have been accused of using excessive force against Muslims and of carrying out arbitrary arrests. The case of Safoora Zargar has become a symbol of the government's crackdown on dissent. She is a young, pregnant woman who has been accused of serious crimes based on little evidence. Her release on bail is a small victory, but it is a reminder that the fight for justice in India is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stanford rape case Judge Aaron Persky faces recall petition,"Community leaders from Santa Clara County filed a notice of intention on Monday to collect signatures to recall Judge Aaron Persky next year. Judge Persky was accused of bias in the sentencing of Brock Turner, a former Stanford University swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in 2015. The recall effort is being led by Recall Judge Aaron Persky, a group of community members who believe that Judge Persky's actions in the Turner case were ""unjust and biased."" The group has 160 days to collect 58,632 valid signatures from registered voters in Santa Clara County in order to force a recall election. If the recall effort is successful, Judge Persky would be the first California judge to be recalled since 1932. Judge Persky has defended his handling of the Turner case, saying that he followed the law and the evidence in making his sentencing decision. He has also said that he is ""deeply sorry"" for the victim's pain. The Turner case generated national outrage and led to widespread criticism of Judge Persky's sentencing decision. Many people felt that the six-month sentence that he gave Turner was too lenient. In response to the criticism, Judge Persky announced in June that he would not seek re-election when his term expires in 2022. The recall effort is the latest development in the ongoing fallout from the Turner case. The case has also led to changes in California law, including a new law that requires judges to consider the impact of sexual assault on victims when making sentencing decisions. The recall effort is expected to be contentious. Judge Persky's supporters argue that he is a fair and impartial judge who has been unfairly targeted by activists. His opponents argue that he is unfit to serve on the bench and that he should be removed from office. The recall election is scheduled to be held on June 7, 2022.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Muslim families sending children to Catholic schools,"By Sean Coughlan Education correspondent For the first time, an annual census of Catholic schools has collected information on the number of pupils from other religions. The biggest group of non-Catholic pupils are from other Christian denominations - but there are growing numbers of Muslims and Hindus. In England, there are around 2,300 Catholic schools, which educate about 10% of all school pupils. The census for 2022 shows that 83% of their pupils are now Catholic - down from 88% a decade ago. Of the remaining 17%, the biggest group are from other Christian denominations, such as Anglican or Methodist. But the number of Muslim pupils in Catholic schools is now 5%, up from 3% a decade ago. And the number of Hindu pupils is now 2%, up from 1% a decade ago. The growth in the number of non-Catholic pupils in Catholic schools reflects the changing demographics of England's population. According to the 2021 census, 46% of the population now identify as Christian, down from 59% a decade ago. The proportion of the population identifying as Muslim has increased from 4.9% to 6.5% over the same period. There are a number of reasons why Muslim families are choosing to send their children to Catholic schools. Some parents are attracted by the schools' strong academic record. Others appreciate the Catholic ethos of the schools, which emphasizes values such as compassion, service, and forgiveness. Some Muslim families also feel that Catholic schools provide a more welcoming environment for their children than non-religious schools. In a survey conducted by the Catholic Education Service, 80% of Muslim parents said that they felt their children were welcomed and respected in Catholic schools. The trend of Muslim families sending their children to Catholic schools is likely to continue in the years to come. As the Muslim population in England continues to grow, so too will the demand for schools that are both academically rigorous and welcoming to pupils of all faiths.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Isa Muazu: Nigeria to accept UK deportee's plane,"Isa Muazu was returned to the UK after a private jet chartered to take him to Nigeria on Friday was met with protests and demonstrations, forcing it to return to England. Muazu, a Nigerian national, was detained by the UK Home Office in November 2021 on immigration grounds and has been fighting to remain in the UK ever since. The Home Office said Muazu had ""no right to remain in the UK and has exhausted all legal avenues to do so"" and they intended to remove him to Nigeria. However, Muazu's supporters argued that the 53-year-old had been living in the UK for more than 30 years and considered it his home. Muazu had travelled to Nigeria in 2019 to visit his sick mother but was refused re-entry to the UK on his return after officials said he had overstayed his visa. His supporters believe he is the victim of a Home Office ""administrative error"" and they have been campaigning for his return. The Nigerian authorities have now agreed to accept Muazu, after initially refusing to cooperate. A spokesperson for the Nigerian High Commission in London said it had ""agreed to issue the necessary travel documents"" for Muazu. ""We are pleased that the Nigerian government has finally agreed to accept Mr Muazu's return,"" said Muazu's legal representative, Jacqueline McKenzie. ""This is a victory for common sense and compassion. Mr Muazu has been living in the UK for over 30 years and it is his home. He should never have been deported in the first place."" Muazu's return to the UK is expected to take place in the coming days. It is unclear whether he will face any further action from the Home Office.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Badger cull: Queen's Brian May praises Welsh government for halting plan,"The Queen guitarist and badger campaigner congratulated Environment Minister John Griffiths and said he had made a courageous decision. Mr Griffiths has opted to vaccinate the animals following a review. May, a patron of the Badger Trust, said the government had listened to science and accepted ""the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is the only humane and effective way to control bovine TB"". ""This is a momentous day for badgers and for the countryside,"" he said. ""I applaud the Welsh government for taking this bold step."" The badger cull has been a controversial issue in England, where it is used to try to control the spread of bovine TB. But there is no scientific consensus on whether the cull is effective, and there are concerns that it is cruel and inhumane. In 2019, the UK government announced that it would end the badger cull in England by 2025. But the Welsh government has said it will continue with its own cull, which is due to start in 2023. Mr Griffiths said he had decided to halt the cull after a review of the evidence. He said the review had found that vaccination was a more effective and humane way to control bovine TB. ""I have listened to the science and I have accepted the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is the only humane and effective way to control bovine TB,"" he said. ""I believe that this is the right decision for Wales and for the welfare of our badgers."" The decision to halt the badger cull has been welcomed by animal welfare groups. The RSPCA said it was ""delighted"" by the news. ""This is a victory for badgers and for common sense,"" said RSPCA Cymru chief executive Chris O'Brien. ""We have always maintained that culling is not an effective or humane way to control bovine TB, and we are pleased that the Welsh government has finally listened to the scientific evidence.""

Germany strikes explained: The long and the short of it,"This week's strikes could be the first of many. So why do they matter? And what do they say about Germany in 2018? We've boiled the long story short. This week, thousands of workers from various sectors in Germany have walked out in a series of strikes, causing major disruptions to public transport, schools, and other essential services. The short of it The strikes are primarily driven by demands for higher wages. High inflation and rising living costs have eroded the purchasing power of many workers. Trade unions, representing workers' interests, are negotiating with employers to secure better pay and benefits. Negotiations have reached an impasse, leading to the current strikes. The long of it Economic factors: The German economy is enjoying a strong period of growth, with low unemployment and rising wages. However, inflation has also been on the rise, outpacing wage growth in some sectors. This has led to a decrease in real wages and a squeeze on household budgets. Political factors: The strikes come at a time of political uncertainty in Germany, with the ruling coalition facing challenges and growing support for far-right and left-wing parties. The strikes could put pressure on the government to address economic concerns and inequality. Social factors: The strikes reflect a growing sense of frustration and dissatisfaction among many workers in Germany. They feel that the benefits of economic growth are not being shared fairly and that their voices are not being heard. What the strikes say about Germany in 2018 The strikes highlight several key trends and issues in contemporary Germany: Economic inequality: The widening gap between the rich and the poor is a growing concern in Germany, and the strikes are a reflection of that. Labor unrest: The strikes show that labor unions remain a powerful force in Germany, capable of mobilizing workers in large numbers. Political polarization: The strikes come at a time of political division in Germany, and they could further exacerbate tensions between the left and the right. What's next? The strikes are likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Negotiations between unions and employers will be closely watched, and the outcome will have significant implications for the German economy and society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Andrew Lloyd Webber: Arts at risk over austerity cuts,"Speaking at the House of Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber said the sector was being put at risk by policies introduced in the wake of the recession.

Lord Lloyd-Webber is one of 150 figures from the UK's theatre industry who have signed a letter to the government warning that the arts are ""on the brink of collapse"" because of soaring energy bills and other costs, while local authority spending cuts are also impacting them. The 150 signatories include stage and screen actors, theatre owners, directors and producers, as well as members of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre. They warn that the government cuts could have ""devastating consequences for an industry that contributes £111bn to the UK economy every year"". In a speech at the Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber said that the arts must be seen as an investment, not a luxury, adding that ""arts institutions and creative industries make our lives better and more beautiful"". The letter to the government argues that ""the energy crisis and cost of living crisis, alongside local authority funding cuts, threaten to decimate our theatres and arts organisations if more support isn't given."" The signatories call on the government to provide urgent support, including a review of business rates, a reduction in VAT on theatre tickets and the introduction of a ""theatrical investment relief"" tax credit to encourage investment in theatre productions. They also demand a ""freeze"" on local authority cuts to arts funding and an acknowledgement of the ""devastating impact"" reductions in spending are having on theatre and other art venues.

Insurers warn of travel premium rise,"By Simon Gompertz Personal finance correspondent, BBC News Drivers going on holiday could need also need extra paperwork, the Association of British Insurers said. Next Thursday, the UK leaves the European Union's single insurance market. This means that the Green Card - the document which proves your car is insured - will no longer be valid in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and Andorra. You can now buy a Green Card from your insurer to prove you have adequate cover. It will cost between £25 and £50. The insurance industry says most people will not need a Green Card, but there are some cases where it is essential. You must have a Green Card if you drive: to Ireland - as it is not part of the EU to Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo to any country that is not part of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and Andorra You might want to get a Green Card if you: are hiring a car abroad are driving near the borders of the countries not covered by the Green Card The ABI also warns the cost of travel insurance is likely to rise as the UK leaves the EU. EU rules mean that insurers can no longer ask customers where they come from when pricing their policies, or take into account previous claims history. This is likely to lead to higher premiums for British holidaymakers, because the UK is seen as a higher-risk country than many EU nations. ""We anticipate that prices will go up for UK residents,"" said the ABI's Matthew Maxwell Scott. The ABI is the trade body for the UK insurance industry. It represents around 200 insurance companies. Sarah Francis, from the travel insurance comparison website TravelSupermarket, said: ""Holidaymakers should expect to pay more for travel insurance when travelling to the EU. ""The ABI are warning of a 6% increase in the cost of travel insurance when travelling to Europe this summer."" The ABI says the increase in premiums is likely to be modest. But Mr Maxwell Scott said: ""There is likely to be a widening of the differential between the prices of travel insurance for EU and non-EU destinations."" He added: ""It is more important than ever that holidaymakers shop around for the best deal on their travel insurance, and make sure they have adequate cover. ""They should also remember that they may need a Green Card to drive in some countries.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The FPOe's rise was not unexpected - the party has been on the rise for some years, and has been predicting that the mainstream parties would lose support. It is not yet clear how the FPOe will behave in parliament, but it could be more disruptive than at any time since it entered parliament in 1999. The Freedom Party leader, Norbert Hofer, said on Monday that the party's advance was a ""great mandate"" for the party. He said the FPOe had won support from ""those who want to regain power in this country"". He added that the party was not interested in governing ""at any price"": ""Personally I would prefer to be in opposition. But I will certainly not participate in a government that works against our values."" The FPOe is opposed to same-sex marriage, immigration, and multiculturalism, among other things. It wants to leave the European Union, and hold a referendum on whether Austria should leave the eurozone. The FPOe's rise has been blamed on a number of factors, including: The public's dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the immigration crisis The country's economic problems The rise of populism across Europe It is unclear whether the OeVP and SPOe will be able to form a stable government. The two parties have very different views on a number of issues, and it is possible that they could clash over policy. The OeVP is more pro-European than the SPOe, and it is more likely to support austerity measures. The SPOe is more left-wing, and it is more likely to support social welfare programmes. If the OeVP and SPOe cannot form a coalition, it is possible that the FPOe could end up in government. This would be a major shift in Austrian politics, and it could have a significant impact on the country's future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cilla Black encouraged me to be an actress - now I'm playing her on stage,"Hayworth followed her instruction. Now 28, she has won her first major role appearing as the star on stage. She will play the late singer and TV host in Cilla The Musical, which opens in August in London. Cilla Black, who died in 2015, was a national treasure, and was known for presenting the TV shows Blind Date and Surprise, Surprise. Hayworth will play Black through the various stages of her career, from her early days as a singer in the 1960s, through to her success as a TV star in the 1970s and 1980s. The musical will also feature Black's relationship with her husband, Bobby Willis. Hayworth was born in Liverpool, where Black grew up, and says she ""has the same accent and mannerisms"" as the star, who was known for speaking her mind and her infectious laugh. ""I'd been told I was like her and I remember watching Cilla Black on TV and thinking she exuded warmth and fun, and she was very strong and independent. I felt like I could relate to her on that level,"" says Hayworth. Despite the similarities, Hayworth was determined to create her own interpretation of Black. ""I wanted to find Cilla's vulnerability and her struggles, because she had a lot of those as well. This role has been a really nice challenge."" Hayworth was cast after a long audition process, which involved singing, dancing, and acting. ""I sang one of Cilla's songs, Anyone Who Had A Heart, and I performed a monologue that told her story,"" she says. ""I had to do a lot of research to really understand her - reading her autobiography and watching lots of YouTube videos. I wanted to get the full picture of who she was."" Hayworth says ""it has been a huge privilege to play such an iconic figure"". ""Cilla was loved by so many people, and I hope I can do her story justice,"" she says. Cilla The Musical will run at the Lyric Theatre, London, from 25 August 2023 to 6 May 2024.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Homebirths to restart with new safeguards,"The arrangement in the Lothians includes a limit of one birthing partner and the need for a separate changing space for them to get into personal protective equipment (PPE). Homebirths currently account for 2% of births in Scotland. The Scottish government said it aimed to get this back to pre-pandemic levels of 5% to 10%. The Royal College of Midwives said homebirths were a ""safe choice"" for many women. The new guidelines were published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). They include advice on how to protect against Covid-19, such as wearing face masks and washing hands regularly. The guidelines also recommend that women should have a birth plan in place that includes their preferences for pain relief and where they would like to give birth. The RCOG said that homebirths were a ""safe and effective"" option for many women. The college said that there was no evidence to suggest that homebirths were more risky than hospital births. The RCM said that homebirths were a ""positive and empowering"" experience for many women. The college said that homebirths could help to reduce the number of interventions, such as episiotomies and Caesarean sections. The Scottish government said that it was committed to providing women with a choice of where to give birth. The government said that it would continue to work with the NHS to ensure that women had access to safe and high-quality maternity care. The new guidelines are likely to be welcomed by many women who are planning to give birth. Homebirths can offer a number of benefits, including: A more relaxed and comfortable environment Reduced risk of interventions Greater control over the birth process If you are considering a homebirth, it is important to talk to your midwife or doctor to discuss the risks and benefits. You should also make sure that you have a birth plan in place that includes your preferences for pain relief and where you would like to give birth.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Unions call for end to local authority pay freeze,"Unison, Unite and the GMB have lodged their annual pay claim, saying a ""living wage"" of £7.20 an hour should be brought in. They want to see a 1% pay rise for all staff and a minimum wage of £7.20 for all local authority workers. The unions say that the pay freeze has had a ""devastating"" impact on local authority workers, who have seen their wages fall in real terms by 20% since 2010. They say that many workers are now struggling to make ends meet, and that the pay freeze is making it difficult for local authorities to recruit and retain staff. The unions are calling on local authorities to end the pay freeze and to invest in their workforce. They say that a pay rise would boost the local economy and help to improve public services. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, said that it was ""disappointed"" by the unions' pay claim. The LGA said that councils are facing ""significant financial pressures"" and that they cannot afford to give their staff a pay rise. The LGA said that it was ""committed to working with the unions to find a fair and affordable settlement"" but that it could not ""promise to meet the unions' demands in full"". The unions have said that they are prepared to take industrial action if their demands are not met. They have warned that they could call a strike ballot of their members if the LGA does not agree to end the pay freeze. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010, when the government imposed a 1% cap on public sector pay rises. The government says that the pay freeze is necessary to reduce the national deficit. The unions say that the pay freeze is unfair and that it is having a devastating impact on public sector workers. They say that the government should end the pay freeze and invest in its workforce.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Greece 'may need 10bn euros more' in aid - Stournaras,"Yannis Stournaras said: ""If there is need for further support to Greece, it will be in the order of about 10bn"". The comments come after the Greek government and its creditors reached an agreement on the terms of a third bailout. The deal is expected to provide Greece with up to €86bn in loans over the next three years. However, Stournaras said that the country may need additional funding if it is to meet its fiscal targets. He said that the Greek government is committed to reducing its budget deficit and debt, but that it may need help from its creditors to do so. ""We are committed to meeting our targets, but we may need some additional support,"" he said. Stournaras' comments suggest that the Greek government is not confident that it can meet its fiscal targets without further assistance from its creditors. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned that Greece may need additional funding, and has said that it is not prepared to provide any more loans to the country until it sees evidence that the Greek government is committed to reforms. The Greek government has been under pressure from its creditors to implement a series of reforms in order to reduce its budget deficit and debt. These reforms include cuts to public spending, tax increases, and reforms to the labour market. The Greek government has agreed to implement these reforms, but it is unclear whether it will be able to do so without causing social unrest. The country has already seen a number of protests against the austerity measures that have been implemented in recent years. If the Greek government is unable to implement the reforms that it has agreed to, it may find itself in need of additional funding from its creditors. This could lead to a further deterioration in the country's economic situation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Crossing Divides: Do you live in a social bubble?,"We asked people in an international poll how they felt about their choice of friends. See how you compare in our interactive quiz: The results of the survey, conducted among people with internet access across 27 countries, suggested that many of us feel we live in social bubbles. The findings were published in the journal 'Nature Human Behaviour'. They revealed that on average, people estimated that around half of their friends were like them in terms of their political views. This was true even in countries with a high degree of political polarisation, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The researchers also found that people were more likely to be friends with people who were similar to them in terms of their age, education, and income. This suggests that we tend to associate with people who share our social and economic status. The findings of this study are important because they highlight the potential for social bubbles to reinforce existing biases and make it more difficult for us to see the world from different perspectives. So, what can we do to break out of our social bubbles? One way is to make a conscious effort to meet people who are different from us. This could involve joining a club or group that focuses on a topic that you're interested in, or volunteering your time to a cause that you care about. Another way to break out of your social bubble is to travel to different countries and cultures. This will expose you to new ideas and ways of life, and help you to see the world from a different perspective. Finally, it's important to be open to new experiences and to challenge your own beliefs. This doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that everyone else says, but it does mean being willing to listen to other people's opinions and to consider their perspectives. Breaking out of our social bubbles can be challenging, but it's important to remember that we all have something to learn from each other. By making an effort to meet people who are different from us, we can broaden our horizons and become more understanding and tolerant individuals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Mayor considers Hoo peninsula in Kent as airport option,"Mr Johnson wants to increase flight capacity around London without expanding Heathrow. He has also been considering building an airport in the Thames Estuary to the east of the city. The Hoo peninsula is located in Kent, to the south-east of London. It is sparsely populated and has good transport links to the capital. The peninsula has been suggested as a potential site for an airport for many years. In 2014, a report by the Airports Commission concluded that the Hoo peninsula was one of the most feasible options for a new airport in the South East. However, the government ultimately decided to expand Heathrow instead. The Mayor of London's interest in the Hoo peninsula has reignited the debate about the need for a new airport in the South East. Supporters of a new airport argue that it is needed to meet the growing demand for air travel. They also say that it would create jobs and boost the economy. Opponents of a new airport argue that it would damage the environment and increase noise pollution. They also say that it is not needed, as there is already sufficient airport capacity in the South East. The government has not yet made a decision on whether to build a new airport in the South East. However, the Mayor of London's interest in the Hoo peninsula is likely to put pressure on the government to reconsider its options. If the government does decide to build a new airport in the South East, the Hoo peninsula is likely to be one of the frontrunners. It is a well-connected site with good transport links to London. However, there are also environmental concerns that need to be considered. The decision of whether or not to build a new airport in the South East is a complex one. There are a number of factors that need to be considered, including the environmental impact, the economic benefits, and the need for additional airport capacity. The government will need to weigh all of these factors carefully before making a decision.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: People 'have got the message' and stayed home,"The Welsh Government responded by imposing severe curbs on people's lives, with fines for disobeying. It came after thousands of people had flocked to beauty spots in the first weekend after the lockdown was announced. But this weekend, things were very different. The streets were largely deserted, and the few people who were out were keeping their distance from each other. The same was true across the UK. In England, the government had advised people to stay at home over the long Easter weekend, and most people had heeded the advice. The roads were quiet, and the parks were empty. It seems that the public has finally got the message about the importance of social distancing. After weeks of mixed messages from the government, it is clear that people now understand the need to stay home to save lives. This is a major breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus. If people continue to follow the advice, it will help to slow the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. However, it is important to remember that the virus is still out there, and we must not become complacent. We must continue to stay home, wash our hands regularly, and avoid contact with others. The government has said that the lockdown will continue for at least three more weeks. This may seem like a long time, but it is important to remember that it is for our own good. By staying home, we are helping to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and the NHS. We can get through this together. By following the advice, we can help to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives. The BBC has been reporting on the coronavirus pandemic since it began.

Bat virus clues to origins of Sars,"By Keeren Flora BBC Radio Science Unit Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats which are closely related to the pathogen that infects humans.  The viruses are the closest relatives yet found to the one which caused the Sars outbreak in 2002-03, but differ from the virus that is now circulating and causing Covid-19. The discovery suggests that the original Sars virus may have originated in horseshoe bats, and jumped into humans via an intermediary animal. The two new viruses, named RmYN02 and RmYN05, were found in bats from Yunnan province in southern China. They were identified by researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who compared their genetic sequence to that of the original Sars virus. The findings have been published in the journal Nature Microbiology. The researchers say that the two new viruses are 96% and 97% identical to the original Sars virus, respectively. This suggests that they are closely related, and may have evolved from a common ancestor. However, the two new viruses are not identical to the original Sars virus. They have some small genetic differences, which means that they are not able to infect human cells in the same way. The researchers say that this suggests that the original Sars virus may have evolved from a common ancestor of the two new viruses, and then changed slightly over time. They believe that the two new viruses may have been circulating in horseshoe bats for some time, and that they may have jumped into humans via an intermediary animal. The researchers say that their findings provide important clues about the origins of the Sars virus, and could help to prevent future outbreaks. They say that their work highlights the need for further research into the viruses that circulate in bats, and the potential risks that they pose to humans. The Sars outbreak in 2002-03 caused widespread alarm, and led to the deaths of more than 700 people. Since then, there have been several other outbreaks of Sars-like viruses, including the current Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers say that their findings could help to develop new vaccines and treatments for Sars-like viruses, and could help to prevent future outbreaks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Alex Salmond launches £103m renewable energy fund,"The Renewable Energy Investment Fund (REIF) aims to attract more private investment to the sector. Its priorities include wave and tidal energy, and renewable district heating. Mr Salmond also announced plans to set up an expert taskforce to advise the Scottish government on the next steps toward achieving its renewable energy ambitions. The taskforce will be led by Professor Sir Jim McDonald, the principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Strathclyde, and will include representatives from industry, academia, and the public sector. It will advise the government on how to develop the right policy and regulatory framework to support the growth of the renewable energy sector, and how to ensure that Scotland remains at the forefront of this global industry. Mr Salmond said: ""Scotland has the potential to be a world leader in renewable energy, and the Renewable Energy Investment Fund will help us to unlock that potential.

Twitter abuse and bomb threat claims probed by police,"The Met said its central e-crime unit would investigate the claims, including three that were made outside London. On Wednesday, four female journalists, a student and a member of the public reported receiving threatening messages, including bomb threats. The threats were made in response to an article published in the Times newspaper about a former MP's alleged sexual harassment. The journalists were all women who had written about the allegations against the former MP. The student was a young woman who had tweeted about the article. The member of the public was a man who had also tweeted about the article. The Met said in a statement: ""We are aware of a number of reports of threatening messages being sent to journalists, a student and a member of the public. These messages are being investigated by our central e-crime unit."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) condemned the threats, saying that they were ""an attempt to intimidate and silence journalists who are doing their job."" The NUJ's general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: ""These threats are a reminder of the dangers that journalists face in the course of their work. We stand with our members and will not be intimidated by those who seek to silence us."" The threats come at a time when there is growing concern about the level of abuse and intimidation faced by journalists online. A recent survey by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) found that nearly two-thirds of female journalists have experienced online abuse. The IFJ's general secretary, Anthony Bellanger, said: ""Online abuse and intimidation are a serious threat to freedom of expression. We urge governments and social media companies to take action to protect journalists from these attacks."" The Met's investigation into the threats is ongoing.

Liberia warlord 'Jungle Jabbah' jailed for 30 years in the US,"Mohammed Jabbateh was found guilty of immigration fraud for falsely telling US authorities in the 1990s that he had never belonged to an armed group. One of the most notorious figures of the Liberian civil wars, Jabbateh - known as ""Jungle Jabbah"" - was jailed for 30 years in a US court in 2018. Jabbateh has always denied any role in the atrocities which took place during the two Liberian civil wars, from 1989-96 and 1999-2003, each of which claimed the lives of an estimated 250,000 people. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia (TRC) found Jabbateh personally responsible for the massacre of more than 1,000 civilians during the first war. The TRC report alleges that Jabbateh recruited and trained child soldiers and ordered the ritualistic cannibalism of civilians. In 2001, Jabbateh was offered asylum in the US after being resettled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He did not disclose his past and was granted permanent residency in 2003. An indictment in 2016 charged Jabbateh with committing crimes in Liberia, including acts of murder, forced labour and the use of child soldiers. He was extradited from the US to Liberia in 2017, but the Liberian authorities failed to prosecute him and returned him to the US to face trial. The US trial focused on Jabbateh's immigration status. Prosecutors argued that he had lied on his asylum application, resulting in his acquiring citizenship which he was ineligible for. Jabbateh claimed he concealed his past to protect himself and his family. The jury found Jabbateh guilty of perjury and fraud and he was sentenced in 2018 to 30 years in prison. The presiding judge, Richard Gergel, said Jabbateh's crimes ""went beyond mere deceit"" and that he had committed ""heinous atrocities that shocked the conscience"". Jabbateh's case has drawn attention to the challenges of prosecuting war crimes in a country where the perpetrators live alongside their victims, and the importance of accountability for atrocities committed during civil wars.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan rules out offensive against Punjab militants,"By M Ilyas Khan BBC News, Islamabad His remarks came hours after he told a parliamentary committee that ""Punjabi Taliban"" were entrenched in southern parts of Punjab. Mr Sharif said they were behind recent attacks in Punjab's Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. Recent attacks in the province have killed more than 100 people, including police officers and civilians. The Taliban are a banned militant group that was set up in Afghanistan in the 1990s with the support of Pakistan. After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, many members returned to Pakistan. They have since regrouped and claimed responsibility for numerous attacks across the country. While the Pakistani government has launched major offensives against the group in other parts of the country, including the north-western tribal region of Waziristan, it has held back from doing so in Punjab. Some analysts believe that the government is reluctant to launch a full-scale operation in Punjab because it does not want to alienate the province's powerful feudal lords, many of whom are believed to have links to the Taliban. Others argue that the government is concerned that a military operation in Punjab could lead to a wider conflict. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said that the government had been ""successful in containing"" the threat from the Punjabi Taliban. He said that the group had been ""degraded"" and that its ""capacity to carry out terrorist attacks has been significantly reduced"". However, he also acknowledged that the group remained a ""threat"" and that the government would continue to take ""stern action"" against it. Mr Sharif's speech was welcomed by some analysts, who said that it showed that the government was serious about tackling the threat from the Punjabi Taliban. However, others were more sceptical. They argued that the government had been talking tough on the Punjabi Taliban for years, but had failed to take any concrete action against them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Havelock House: Residents welcome rejection of demolition plans,"The building, on lower Ormeau Road, was vacated in 2018 ahead of a UTV move to new offices on City Quays. London company Olympian Homes bought the site with plans to knock it down and build around 145 apartments. However, Belfast City Council's planning committee rejected the application, following a public consultation that saw 119 objections and one representation in support. The Twentieth Century Society welcomed the decision, saying it was an ""important step in the right direction"". ""This is potentially a landmark case,"" said the society's director Catherine Croft. ""Havelock House is a key part of Belfast's architectural heritage. It is a striking building that gives the city a distinctive character.

Dog's dinner: DNA clue to how dogs became our friends,"By Helen Briggs BBC News Our canine companions developed the ability to digest starchy foods during the farming revolution thousands of years ago, according to DNA. This helped them scavenge more effectively for human scraps and may have been key to their domestication. The results, published in Nature, suggest that genetic changes in dogs since wolves became our pets were heavily influenced by the changing diets of humans. Scientists at Uppsala University in Sweden analysed DNA from hundreds of ancient and modern wolves, dogs, and foxes. They found that dogs developed a new gene variant after they became domesticated that helped them digest amylase - a starch-digesting enzyme found in saliva. The emergence of this gene is thought to have coincided with the advent of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. Farming led to a shift in the human diet towards more plant-based foods, which produced a change in the types of food scraps available to dogs. ""Around this time, dogs would have been hanging around humans and scavenging for scraps,"" said Prof Peter Savolainen, part of the research team. ""Starch was a new type of food for them, so the selective pressure to adapt to this food source may have been essential for their survival."" The study found a high frequency of the starch-digesting gene variant in dogs from East Asia, the region where rice farming first began. The scientists believe that dogs from this region then spread the gene to other dog populations around the world. The findings have implications for modern pet dogs, many of whom are fed a diet that is still relatively high in starch. And just like our early canine companions, modern dogs still seem to have a sweet tooth for starchy treats. ""I know lots of dogs who love bread,"" said Prof Savolainen. ""And although it's not great for their health, I think it's something that reflects their genetic interest in starches."" The study also found that dogs developed other genetic changes since they diverged from wolves, including changes that affect their body size, behaviour, and disease susceptibility. These changes may have resulted from ongoing natural selection, artificial selection by humans, or a combination of the two. ""Our results provide strong evidence that dogs have evolved in response to changes in the human diet,"" said Prof Savolainen. ""This highlights the close relationship between humans and dogs, and the role of diet in this relationship.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
South East hospitals charged £1.5m for ambulance delays,"Patient handovers should not take longer than 15 minutes. Hospitals are charged £2.44 for each extra minute. Jonathan Fox, from the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, told the BBC the charges were ""nothing new"" but said the data highlighted the ""severity, scale and cost to the NHS of handover delays"". The data, released under freedom of information laws, show how much each NHS trust paid to South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) in 2021-22 for delayed handovers.  King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London was charged the most - £443,326.48 - followed by Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust which paid £345,617.44 and St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which was charged £297,940.80. Of the 28 trusts covered by SECAmb, only two were not charged in 2021-22. These were the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust and the Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust, which is responsible for community health services rather than acute hospital care. The data also reveals the wide variation in charges between trusts. For example, in March 2022, the Princess Royal University Hospital NHS Trust was charged a total of £105,059.04 while Medway NHS Foundation Trust was charged just £3,332.96. A spokeswoman for SECAmb said the trust was ""committed to working with our NHS partners to improve handover times and ensure that our patients receive the best possible care"". She said: ""We have invested significantly in our ambulance service, including increasing staff numbers and introducing new vehicles and technology. We are also working closely with NHS trusts to improve handover processes and reduce delays."" The charges for delayed handovers are part of a national scheme introduced in 2017 to improve patient flow through A&E departments. The scheme is designed to encourage hospitals to improve their handover processes and reduce the amount of time that patients spend waiting in ambulances. The charges are paid by hospitals to ambulance services. The money is then used to fund ambulance services, including staff costs, vehicles and equipment.

New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague,"The former foreign secretary warned of the risk of a ""hate-filled"" campaign if the government attempted to revisit the issue and tell people ""they got it wrong"". He suggested that the government should focus on other issues, such as cost of living and climate change. ""We need to talk about real issues, not repeat referendums,"" he said. Hague's comments come amid growing speculation that Prime Minister Liz Truss could call a new referendum on Brexit. Truss has said she is ""not ruling out"" a second referendum, but has also said that she wants to focus on ""delivering"" Brexit. However, a new poll suggests that the public is divided on the issue of a second referendum. The poll, conducted by YouGov, found that 42% of Britons would support a second referendum, while 38% would oppose it. The poll also found that support for a second referendum is highest among young people, with 54% of 18-24 year-olds saying they would support it. The issue of a second referendum is likely to continue to be debated in the coming months, as the government faces pressure from both sides of the Brexit divide. Meanwhile, the leader of the Liberal Democrats has said that he would support a second referendum if it were ""the only way"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Sir Ed Davey said that he would prefer to see the government negotiate a new deal with the EU, but that he would ""not rule out"" supporting a second referendum if necessary. ""If it is the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit, then I would support a second referendum,"" he said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
MSPs back Scottish smacking ban proposals,"A bill lodged by Green MSP John Finnie is designed to give children the same protection from assault as adults. It would repeal the common law defence of ""justifiable assault"" for parents and carers, which currently allows them to use ""reasonable"" physical punishment on children. The bill has the backing of the Scottish government and is likely to be passed by the Scottish Parliament. If it becomes law, Scotland will become the first country in the UK to ban smacking. Supporters of the ban say it is necessary to protect children from physical abuse and to promote positive parenting. They argue that smacking is ineffective as a form of discipline and can damage children's physical and mental health. Opponents of the ban say it is a step too far and that it will criminalise parents who use reasonable physical punishment. They argue that the law should not interfere in family life and that parents should be allowed to discipline their children as they see fit. The debate over smacking is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and it is likely to continue for many years to come. However, the Scottish government has made it clear that it believes that a ban on smacking is necessary to protect children from harm. If the bill is passed, it will send a clear message that smacking is not acceptable in Scotland. It will also help to change attitudes towards physical punishment and promote positive parenting. In addition to the bill lodged by John Finnie, there is also a separate campaign to ban smacking in Scotland. The campaign is led by the group Children 1st, which is calling for a public consultation on the issue. Children 1st argues that a ban on smacking would send a strong message that violence against children is unacceptable. It would also help to change attitudes towards physical punishment and promote positive parenting. The campaign has the support of a number of organisations, including the Scottish Children's Commissioner, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and the Royal College of Nursing. The Scottish government has said that it will consider the findings of any public consultation on smacking before making a decision on whether to introduce a ban. However, the government has also made it clear that it believes that a ban on smacking is necessary to protect children from harm. It is likely, therefore, that the government will introduce a ban if it receives public support for doing so.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Algerian army 'kills jihadist behind Herve Gourdel beheading',"Abdelmalek Gouri and two associates were shot dead late on Monday in the town of Isser, a statement said. His group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), pledged allegiance to Islamic State. The army said he was killed in an ambush after the three men refused to surrender. Gourdel, a 55-year-old mountain guide, was taken hostage in the mountains east of Algiers on 21 September. He was featured in a video released a week later by his captors, who threatened to kill him if France did not halt air strikes in Iraq. France refused and on 24 September the militants released another video showing Gourdel's severed head. President Francois Hollande described the killing as ""a barbaric act"" and said France would ""continue to fight terrorism"". The French air force has stepped up its strikes on Islamic State in Iraq since Gourdel's death. Jund al-Khilafa is believed to have only a few dozen members and is one of several small Islamist groups operating in Algeria. The group emerged in 2014 and is led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran jihadist who was involved in the 2013 siege of a gas plant in eastern Algeria that killed 40 people. Belmokhtar's group is based in southern Libya and has been linked to several attacks in Algeria and neighboring Mali. The Algerian army has been fighting Islamist militants for decades, and has largely succeeded in containing the threat. However, the emergence of Jund al-Khilafa and other groups aligned with Islamic State has raised concerns that Algeria could become a new battleground in the militants' global campaign. The killing of Gourdel has also highlighted the security challenges facing Westerners in North Africa, where several other hostages have been taken in recent years. In 2011, two French journalists were killed in northern Mali by al-Qaeda-linked militants, and in 2013, a British tourist was kidnapped and held for three months before being released. The kidnappings and killings have led some Western governments to advise their citizens against traveling to certain parts of North Africa.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Wage inequality lowest in Wales, says ONS figures","By Sarah Dickins BBC Wales economics correspondent The highest paid 1% of Welsh workers earn on average £41.20 an hour, seven times the lowest 10% on £5.80. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there has been little change in wage inequality in Wales since 2019, when the gap was slightly narrower. Wales has the lowest wage inequality of the UK nations and regions. But unions say the squeeze on living costs means workers in Wales are still struggling. The ONS figures show that since records began in 1997, there has been a long-term increase in the hourly pay gap between the highest and lowest paid workers in Wales. In 1997, the top 10% of earners were paid 3.8 times more than the lowest 10%. The TUC said the rising cost of food, fuel and energy meant workers were ""in the midst of a cost of living crisis"". Shavanah Taj, the TUC's Wales regional secretary, said: ""This data shows that the gap between the highest and lowest paid workers is growing. ""Workers in Wales, like workers across the UK, are in the midst of a cost of living crisis."" She called on the UK government to take ""urgent action"" to support low-income workers and families. ""That means increasing the minimum wage to at least £10 an hour immediately, boosting Universal Credit and increasing investment in public services,"" she added. The Welsh government said it was ""committed to tackling inequality"" and had taken steps to support low-paid workers. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have introduced the real living wage for all our employees and NHS workers, and invested £36m to establish the Young Person's Guarantee, which will ensure young people in Wales are offered a job, apprenticeship, training opportunity or other support after completing their education or training. ""We are also investing heavily in supporting businesses to grow and innovate, which will help to create more high-quality jobs in Wales.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Birmingham voters reject elected mayor plan,"Birmingham was among 10 English cities voting in mayoral referendums on the same day as the local council elections. In Birmingham 57.8% voted no. Eight other cities voted to adopt the elected mayor model. The referendum was held on 5 May 2023. <br> The proposal to change Birmingham’s system of local government was put forward by Birmingham City Council. It argued that a mayor would be able to provide stronger leadership and would be more accountable to the public than the current committee system. <br> However, the proposal was opposed by a number of groups, including the Birmingham Trades Union Council and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. They argued that an elected mayor would be too powerful and would not be representative of the city as a whole. <br> The turnout for the referendum was 28.9%, which was lower than the turnout for the local council elections. This suggests that many people were not engaged with the issue of whether or not to have an elected mayor. <br> The result of the referendum means that Birmingham will retain its current committee system of local government. This system is based on the principle of collective responsibility, meaning that all decisions are made by the council as a whole. <br> The result of the referendum is a blow to the government’s plans to introduce elected mayors in all of England’s major cities. However, it is not clear whether the government will abandon its plans in light of the Birmingham result. <br> The decision on whether or not to have an elected mayor is a complex one. There are a number of factors to consider, including the size of the city, the level of public engagement, and the nature of the local political landscape. <br> In the case of Birmingham, it is clear that the public was not convinced by the arguments in favor of an elected mayor. It is also worth noting that Birmingham has a long history of strong civic leadership, which may have made the public less likely to support a change to the current system.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid: Highest weekly deaths in Wales since pandemic began,"There were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before. This was nearly 40% of all registered deaths, the highest proportion since the pandemic began. The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also show that the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales since the pandemic began were recorded in the last week of December. Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate of 297 people in the week ending 29 December. This is up from 172 the previous week and is the highest weekly total since the week ending 7 May 2020. The number of Covid-related deaths in Wales has been rising in recent weeks, after a period when they had been relatively low. In the week ending 18 December, there were 15 Covid-related deaths. In the week ending 25 December, there were 29 Covid-related deaths. And in the week ending 1 January, there were 47 Covid-related deaths. The ONS figures show that the number of deaths from all causes in Wales has also been increasing in recent weeks. In the week ending 15 January, there were 1,165 deaths in Wales, up from 1,105 the previous week. This is the highest weekly total since the week ending 23 April 2020. The increase in deaths is likely to be due to a number of factors, including the cold weather, the flu season, and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The Welsh government has said that it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation and is ""taking action to reduce the number of deaths"". The government has urged people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu, and to take other measures to protect themselves, such as wearing masks in crowded places and washing their hands regularly. The government has also said that it is ""working with the NHS to ensure that there is enough capacity to meet the increased demand for healthcare services"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Belarus: Journalists covering protests stripped of accreditation,"Two journalists with the BBC's Russian service are among those affected. In a statement, the BBC said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the move by the Belarusian authorities. ""Journalists must be allowed to do their jobs without fear of reprisals,"" the statement said. ""We stand by our journalists and will continue to report on the situation in Belarus."" The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) said that the move was a ""blatant attack on freedom of the press"" and called on the authorities to reinstate the journalists' accreditation. ""This is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence independent journalists who are reporting on the protests,"" BAJ chairman Andrei Bastunets said. ""We will not be silenced."" The move by the Belarusian authorities comes amid a wider crackdown on dissent in the country. In recent months, hundreds of people have been arrested and detained for taking part in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's rule. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and has been accused of rigging elections and suppressing dissent. The current protests were sparked by the August 9 presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide. However, the opposition and many international observers have said that the election was rigged. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some violent incidents. In August, a protester was killed by a police rubber bullet. The Belarusian authorities have responded to the protests with a heavy-handed crackdown. Police have used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons against protesters. Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained, and some have been tortured. The international community has condemned the crackdown and called for Lukashenko to step down. The European Union has imposed sanctions on Belarus, and the United States has said that it will consider imposing sanctions as well. Despite the crackdown, the protests have continued. Protesters have taken to the streets every day since the election, and they show no signs of giving up.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Over 300 patients refuse ambulance over Covid-19 fears,"Toby Lewis, chief executive of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, said hospitals are now ""much clearer"" about how to manage the infection. ""We've been doing this now for quite some time, we've had this experience over the last couple of months, so I think the trust is now much better placed and better equipped at managing this issue,"" he said. ""So all our hospitals and all of our services have got safe pathways in place for managing patients. We're disinfecting equipment and we're cleaning our facilities regularly, our staff are washing their hands frequently, and we're providing masks and gloves where necessary."" He said the trust is also working with Public Health England to ""ensure that we're following all the guidance and that we're doing everything we can to protect our patients and our staff"". Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust is one of a number of trusts across the UK that have reported a rise in the number of patients refusing to be transported to hospital by ambulance because of fears over Covid-19. A survey by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives found that 306 patients had refused to be taken to hospital by ambulance between 1 March and 10 April. The survey also found that 136 patients had left an ambulance or hospital department before they had been seen by a clinician. The association's chief executive, Martin Flaherty, said the findings were ""concerning"" and that the public should ""not be afraid"" to call for an ambulance if they need one. ""We understand that people may be worried about catching Covid-19, but we want to reassure them that our ambulances are safe,"" he said. ""Our crews are following all the necessary infection control procedures and we are doing everything we can to protect our patients and our staff."" The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has also urged the public not to be afraid to call for an ambulance if they need one.

Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision',"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off due to mistakes in the care of Jack Adcock, six, after a criminal trial. The Court of Appeal heard her removal for a ""one-off mistake"" had caused ""significant distress"" but should not have resulted in her losing her career. The case has highlighted concerns over the GMC's approach to fitness to practise hearings and raised questions over whether doctors are being unfairly punished. Her suspension was met with widespread condemnation from the medical profession, who argued that it was disproportionate to the mistake she had made. They said it would have a chilling effect on other doctors, making them less willing to take risks. The GMC defended its decision, saying that it needed to protect the public and that Dr Bawa-Garba's mistake had fallen ""far below the standards expected of a doctor"". The Court of Appeal agreed that Dr Bawa-Garba's mistake had been serious but said that it did not justify striking her off. The court said that the GMC had failed to take into account her good character and her previously unblemished record. The court also said that the GMC had not given enough weight to the fact that Dr Bawa-Garba had admitted her mistake and had taken steps to improve her practice. The GMC said it would consider the court's judgment carefully and would decide whether to appeal. Dr Bawa-Garba said she was ""relieved and grateful"" at the court's decision. She said she hoped to return to work as a doctor as soon as possible. The case has raised important questions about the GMC's role and the way it regulates doctors. It has also highlighted the need for a more proportionate approach to fitness to practise hearings. The GMC needs to find a way to balance the need to protect the public with the need to ensure that doctors are treated fairly. It must also find a way to restore public confidence in the medical profession.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
EasyJet hopes to reopen 75% of route network by August,"The airline is already starting limited services this month, as it adjusts to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Customers and cabin crew must wear face masks, and no food or drink will be served on board. EasyJet will use the experience gained from these services to gradually bring more aircraft back into operation through summer and during the peak holiday period in August. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said: ""The safety and well-being of our customers and crew remains our highest priority. ""The measures we are implementing will ensure we are operating our flights safely and in line with the highest standards of hygiene, giving our customers the confidence to fly with us."" EasyJet's flights will initially operate from eight UK airports - Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle. The destinations served will include some of Europe's most popular beach and city break destinations, such as Malaga, Palma, Faro, Corfu, Mykonos and Venice. Customers will be able to book flights on the EasyJet website or through the mobile app. The airline has also announced a number of other measures to help customers feel safe when flying, including: Enhanced cleaning and disinfection of aircraft Hand sanitizer will be available throughout the airport and on board aircraft Passengers will be asked to check in online and print their own boarding passes Passengers will be required to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their flight Passengers will be asked to maintain social distancing at all times EasyJet is the latest airline to announce plans to resume flying after the coronavirus lockdown. British Airways has already started to operate a limited number of flights from Heathrow, and plans to resume more services in July. Ryanair has also announced plans to resume flying from July, with a reduced schedule. The aviation industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines around the world grounding their fleets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has estimated that the airline industry will lose $84bn (£67bn) in revenue this year. But there are signs that the industry is starting to recover, as governments around the world begin to ease lockdown restrictions.

Why we need internet jokes and memes more than ever,"By Will ChalkNewsbeat reporter But how closely are the two linked and what does that say about our mindsets, the internet and our society? Yeah. We're tackling some big questions. And, let's be honest, we are still in the early stages of working out its effects on our lives. But I'm interested in the internet from a philosophical point of view. On some level, the internet is a mirror to the human condition. Sure, it can be a tool for good. Sharing information, supporting each other and connecting people from across the globe. But we can't ignore the toxic side of the web. From misinformation to online abuse, the internet has fostered some of the ugliest parts of society. So much of what we are online is performed. We share the good and the funny things, but how much of ourselves are we shielding? I suggest we look to internet jokes and memes for answers. They're a reflection of ourselves, our foibles, our fears and our dreams. They can be stupid, smart, funny, dull, bizarre, satirical, nonsensical, absurd - all of these things and something we cannot yet comprehend or categorise. I mean, that's what memes are for. Take, for example, the ""distracted boyfriend"" meme that became popular in 2017. The picture is of a man walking down the street, looking at another woman. His girlfriend, walking next to him, is looking the other way. The caption reads: ""Me trying to focus on something important while my mind is distracted by something stupid."" This meme is funny because it is relatable. We have all been distracted by something stupid at some point in our lives. It also pokes fun at our own hypocrisy. We all want to be seen as intelligent and attentive, but we can't help but be distracted by the silly things in life. Another example is the ""two buttons"" meme. This meme shows two buttons, one labelled ""good"" and the other labelled ""bad"". The caption reads: ""Which button will you press?"" This meme is funny because it is so simple. It forces us to confront our own moral choices. We all like to think of ourselves as good people, but what would we do if we were faced with a difficult decision? Internet jokes and memes are not just a way to waste time. They are a way for us to express ourselves, to connect with others, and to make sense of the world around us. They are a reflection of our culture and our society. And they are more important than ever in a world that is increasingly complex and confusing. So next time you see an internet joke or meme, don't just scroll past it. Take a moment to think about it. What does it say about you? What does it say about the world? And most importantly, what does it make you laugh at?",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Census 2020: US adds controversial citizenship question,"A dozen US states are suing to block the move, saying it will deter immigrants from participating. Trump administration officials say the data will help the government allocate resources and enforce the Voting Rights Act. The question, which asks respondents if they are US citizens, was last included in the census in 1950. It was removed in subsequent censuses due to concerns that it discouraged participation by immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants. Opponents of the question argue that it will have the same effect today, leading to an undercount of the population, particularly in immigrant communities. They also argue that the question is unnecessary, as the government can obtain citizenship information from other sources, such as the American Community Survey. Supporters of the question argue that it is necessary to ensure an accurate census count. They say that the data will help the government allocate resources to communities with large immigrant populations and enforce the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in voting based on race or national origin. The Trump administration has said that the question is ""essential"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act. However, critics have argued that the administration's real motive is to suppress the vote of immigrants, particularly Latino immigrants, who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. The legal battle over the citizenship question is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. The Court has previously ruled that the government has a legitimate interest in collecting citizenship data, but it has also said that the government cannot use the data to discriminate against immigrants. The outcome of the legal battle will have a significant impact on the 2020 census. If the citizenship question is allowed to remain on the census, it could lead to an undercount of the population, particularly in immigrant communities. This could have a negative impact on the allocation of resources and the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
No cause of death for Eric Garner after New York arrest,"Continuing from the given text, the incident involving Eric Garner has sparked outrage and raised questions about police use of force. Two officers and a police sergeant have been placed on desk duty while they are investigated. Speaking to reporters, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said: ""The video is disturbing and raises serious questions."" He also said it was inappropriate for officers to put their hands around a suspect's neck. The video has been widely shared on social media, and has led to protests in New York City and other cities across the United States. Protesters are demanding justice for Garner and an end to police brutality. Some protesters believe that Garner was killed as a result of excessive force used by the police officers. However, the medical examiner's report has not yet been released, and it is unknown what caused Garner's death. The New York City Police Department has a long history of using excessive force against minority suspects. In 2014, a grand jury declined to indict a police officer who killed an unarmed black man named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. That decision led to widespread protests and unrest across the United States. The Garner case is likely to add to the already strained relationship between the police and minority communities. It is also likely to lead to increased scrutiny of police use of force in the United States. In a statement, Garner's family said: ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our loved one. We believe that the officers who killed Eric should be held accountable for their actions."" The family also called for an independent investigation into Garner's death. The Garner case is a reminder of the ongoing problem of police brutality in the United States. It is a tragedy that has left a family and a community in mourning. It is also a call to action for those who believe that police brutality must end.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Health regulator problems 'persist',"By Nick Triggle Health correspondent, BBC News The Care Quality Commission (CQC) was only created in 2009 but has been under fire virtually ever since. The House of Commons' Health Select Committee said the CQC had ""a history of missed opportunities to improve quality and patient safety"". The committee chair, Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, said the CQC was ""too quick to praise and slow to punish"". ""The CQC must become a more consistent, more effective, more transparent and more independent regulator,"" he said. The committee's report comes after a series of high-profile scandals in the NHS, including the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds of patients died unnecessarily due to poor care. The CQC has been criticized for failing to take tough action against underperforming hospitals and care homes. In its report, the committee said the CQC ""needs to be much clearer about the standards it expects providers to meet, and it needs to be more consistent in its judgments"". The committee also said the CQC ""needs to be more transparent about its inspection process and its decision-making"". The CQC has defended its record, saying it has made significant progress in improving the quality of care in the NHS. However, the committee's report suggests that much more needs to be done. The CQC is responsible for regulating all health and social care services in England. It was created in 2009 to replace the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The CQC's remit includes: Inspecting health and social care services Enforcing standards of care Taking action against providers who fail to meet standards Providing information to the public about the quality of services The CQC has been criticized for a number of reasons, including: Being too lenient on underperforming providers Failing to take tough action against providers who put patients at risk Not being transparent about its inspection process Not being independent enough from the government The CQC has defended its record, saying it has made significant progress in improving the quality of care in the NHS.

Royal Cornwall Hospital 'neglected' woman who died in A&E,"Katy Lowry, 30, who had chromosomal abnormalities and learning difficulties, was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital on 13 December 2016. She had been vomiting every 15 minutes for nearly 24 hours. Despite her condition, Lowry waited for hours in A&E before being seen by a doctor. She was repeatedly sent home and told to come back the following day. On 14 December, Lowry returned to the hospital with her mother. She was seen by a doctor but was again sent home. On 15 December, Lowry was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance after her condition deteriorated. She was admitted to A&E at 8.20pm but died less than two hours later. A post-mortem examination found that Lowry died from a perforated bowel. The coroner ruled that her death was ""wholly avoidable"" and that she had been ""neglected"" by the hospital. The Royal Cornwall Hospital has apologized for the ""failings"" in Lowry's care and has launched an investigation. Lowry's family said they were ""devastated"" by her death and angry that she had been ""failed"" by the hospital. They said: ""Katy was a vulnerable person who needed help. She should have been seen by a doctor and given proper treatment straight away."" The family is now calling for a public inquiry into Lowry's death. The Royal Cornwall Hospital is one of several hospitals in the UK that have been criticized for providing poor care to patients. In 2013, a report by the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital was ""inadequate"" and ""unsafe."" The hospital has since been placed in special measures and is under close scrutiny by the government. The Health Secretary has said that he is ""extremely concerned"" about the care provided at the Royal Cornwall Hospital. He said: ""I have asked the Care Quality Commission to carry out an urgent investigation into the hospital. I want to know what went wrong and why."" The government is also planning to launch a new inquiry into the provision of care in hospitals. The inquiry will be led by Robert Francis QC, who previously led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. The Francis Inquiry found that hundreds of patients died at Mid Staffordshire hospital due to poor care. The inquiry also found that the hospital had a culture of bullying and intimidation that prevented staff from speaking out about concerns. The government hopes that the new inquiry will help to identify the problems in the NHS and ensure that patients are treated with dignity and respect.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The negotiations have been difficult, with both sides accusing the other of being unreasonable. The UK wants a deal that gives it the freedom to set its own laws and trade with other countries. The EU wants a deal that ensures that the UK does not gain an unfair advantage over its members. Le Drian's comments are the latest sign that the negotiations are likely to be tough. He said that the UK and EU were ""miles apart"" on a number of key issues, including fishing rights and state aid. He also said that the UK was ""underestimating"" the challenges it would face in negotiating a trade deal with the EU. He said that the UK would have to accept the EU's rules and regulations if it wanted access to the single market. The UK government has said that it is prepared to leave the EU without a deal if it cannot get a satisfactory agreement. However, this would be a major blow to the UK economy. The EU has said that it is willing to be flexible in the negotiations, but it will not compromise on its core principles. The two sides are due to meet again for negotiations next week. It is hoped that they will be able to make progress, but it is clear that the negotiations will be difficult.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Shakespeare's skull 'probably stolen' from Stratford grave,"The discovery gives credence to a news report in 1879, later dismissed as fiction, that trophy hunters took the skull from his shallow grave in 1794. A team used a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) scan to look through the soil beneath the Holy Trinity Church floorboards, where Shakespeare is buried. The scan revealed anomalies which suggested that the poet's skull may have been removed from his grave. The parish clerk's record of the funeral in April 1616 states that Shakespeare's body was placed in a shallow grave dug seven feet deep. There was no evidence of a coffin. By the 17th Century, it was common practice to reuse graves after 10 years, and Shakespeare's grave was considered fair game. In 1794, the sexton of the church at the time, William Castle, offered visitors to Shakespeare's grave the opportunity to view the skull and other bones for a fee. A young man paid a shilling to view the skull, but when he wanted to sketch it, Castle demanded another five shillings. The youth refused, and a fight ensued. According to the press cutting from The Argos of 7th June 1879: ""The struggle was witnessed by a sexton from an adjoining parish. When questioned about the disturbance, Castle confessed that he had dug up the remains the previous May. ""He said that he sold the skull, which appeared to have been perforated by a pike or other weapon, to a man in a white coat and brown trousers. Castle was drunk at the time and did not know the buyer's name. The skull was then worth £300 but would now be worth many times that amount."" In 1836, a monument was built close to the grave to deter visitors from trying to dig up the remains. The grave itself lies within the sanctuary and is covered by a stone slab. The GPR scan revealed significant voids beneath the floor around the tomb believed to be Shakespeare's. Dr. Kevin Colls, who led the GPR scan team, said: ""We discovered a significant void in the area of the skull and neck, and other voids that appear to be consistent with the removal of long bones. ""I am more convinced on the basis of what we saw on the scan, that the skull is not present in the grave. This is a significant development that supports the theory that Shakespeare's skull was stolen."" The Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, the Rev. Patrick Taylor, said: ""These findings are fascinating and provide fresh evidence to support the theory that Shakespeare's skull was stolen.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Stone Roses film ‘has band’s blessing’,"By Kev Geoghegan Entertainment reporter, BBC News, in Cannes The film is part of a slate of projects announced by BBC Films in Cannes. It tells the story of a gang of young teenagers who grow up listening to the music of The Stone Roses and dream of emulating their heroes on stage. The film has the blessing of the band, and guitarist John Squire is on board as an executive producer. McCluskey, who wrote the film, said he was inspired by his own experiences growing up in Manchester in the 1980s and 1990s. ""I wanted to capture the feeling of that time, when The Stone Roses were the biggest band in the world and they were inspiring a whole generation of young people,"" he said. ""The film is about the power of music and how it can change your life."" The film will be directed by Shane Meadows, who is known for his work on films such as This Is England and Twenty Four Seven. Meadows said he was attracted to the project because of its ""heart and soul"". ""It's a film about friendship, love and music,"" he said. ""It's a film that will resonate with anyone who has ever been a teenager and dreamed of being in a band."" The film is due to start shooting in Manchester in the summer of 2023. BBC Films is a division of the BBC that produces and distributes feature films. It has been responsible for a number of successful films in recent years, including The Favourite, Bohemian Rhapsody and Judy. The Stone Roses are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They are one of the most successful British bands of all time, with their debut album, The Stone Roses, being hailed as a masterpiece. The band split up in 1996, but they reformed in 2011 and have been touring and recording ever since.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
There's now a word for nails on a blackboard - but it's not in English,"It's a word to describe the feeling we get when we hear the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard, or a knife scraping a plate. The word is ""misophonia"", and it comes from the Greek words ""miso"" (hatred) and ""phone"" (sound). People with misophonia have a strong negative reaction to certain sounds, even everyday ones like chewing, slurping, or breathing. These sounds can trigger feelings of anger, anxiety, or even panic. Misophonia is a relatively new condition, and it's not yet fully understood. However, research suggests that it may be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, brain structure, and life experiences. There is no cure for misophonia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include sound therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and medication. If you think you may have misophonia, it's important to see a doctor to get a diagnosis. There are also a number of support groups available for people with misophonia, which can provide information and support. What causes misophonia? The exact cause of misophonia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including: Genetics: Misophonia may be inherited, as it often runs in families. Brain structure: People with misophonia have been found to have differences in the way their brains process sound. Life experiences: Certain life experiences, such as trauma or abuse, may increase the risk of developing misophonia. What are the symptoms of misophonia? The symptoms of misophonia can vary from person to person, but they typically include: A strong negative reaction to certain sounds Feelings of anger, anxiety, or panic Difficulty concentrating Withdrawal from social situations Irritability Fatigue How is misophonia treated? There is no cure for misophonia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include: Sound therapy: This involves listening to sounds that are designed to reduce the negative reaction to trigger sounds. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): This type of therapy helps people to change the way they think about and react to trigger sounds. Medication: Some medications, such as antidepressants, can help to reduce the symptoms of misophonia.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Blood test 'detects cancer relapse',"Blood test 'detects cancer relapse' By James Gallagher Health editor, BBC News website Scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found traces of breast cancer eight months before doctors would normally have noticed. In the trial, the blood test spotted the secondary tumours in 33 out of 49 patients, or 67%, eight months earlier than scans, on average. And three-quarters of the patients were correctly identified by the test within five months. The findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, could be used to guide doctors in giving follow-up treatment after surgery. 'This is a really important advance,' said Prof Nicholas Turner, who led the study. 'We know that detecting cancer recurrence at the earliest possible stage is critical to successful treatment, but current blood tests are far too insensitive.' The test measures the amount of circulating tumour DNA - ctDNA - in the blood. Every time a cell dies, it releases some of its DNA into the blood. Cancerous cells release more ctDNA than normal cells. So a higher-than-normal level of ctDNA in the bloodstream can indicate that cancer is present. In the trial, the test correctly spotted the tumours in almost all patients - 98% -  once they were larger than 3mm. But between 1 and 3mm, the detection rate was 30%. 'We don't yet have enough information to see if this approach could detect cancers less than 1mm, but we continue to improve our techniques,' said Prof Turner. The team think the test could be used to target follow-up treatments for patients who have had surgery. Doctors would be able to detect whether patients were likely to suffer a relapse at least five months earlier than they can with scans. 'For those patients identified with measurable disease, that means treatment can be started more quickly, so giving them the best chance of cure,' said Prof Turner. The team want to do further studies now to confirm the benefits of the test and to develop it for other cancers. 'This is an important step forward in the blood testing field,' said Dr Lisa Wilde, Cancer Research UK's head of research information. 'It's the first time researchers have seen the potential of detecting cancer recurrence at a time when doctors would not normally notice the tumour through standard imaging tests. 'This research could pave the way for a blood test that could improve the care of patients after surgery.'",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Extra £40m for green spaces in England, Boris Johnson pledges","By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The government says the cash will fund thousands of jobs in conservation. The prime minister also promised new national parks and greater protections for England’s iconic landscapes. Environmentalists welcomed the money, but said it represented only a very small proportion of the investment that was needed to tackle the climate and nature emergencies. The announcement came on the eve of the UN climate summit in Glasgow which the UK is hosting. At the summit, world leaders will discuss ways to cut carbon dioxide emissions and protect and restore nature. Campaigners will be looking to persuade governments to come up with more ambitious targets and the extra funding for green spaces will help the UK's case since it will demonstrate that the government is willing to back up its promises with cash. The government says the project will create or support about 6,000 jobs, 4,000 of which will be in the public sector and the rest in the private sector. The 1,500 miles of new footpaths and cycleways are intended to encourage people to get outdoors for exercise and improve their health and well-being. Other themes include: A National Forest for the north of England. Setting up a new national park in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Extending the existing New Forest National Park in Hampshire. Creating a national park in the Yorkshire Dales. Planting millions more trees as part of the UK's commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Creating a Nature Recovery Network - a network of interconnected land and sea to aid wildlife. The government says the project will create or support about 6,000 jobs, 4,000 of which will be in the public sector and the rest in the private sector. In the run-up to the election last year, Mr Johnson promised to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030, with an interim target of 10% to be achieved by 2023. The government says 11% of land in England is now designated for protection and the new announcement is intended to help hit the target. Conservationists warned, however, that designating land is not enough and the government needs to ensure that the protected areas are managed in a way that benefits nature. The Wildlife Trusts said the extra funding was ""a good start"" but more was needed. ""This funding is welcome at a time when the climate and nature crises are threatening to overwhelm the natural world,"" said the group's chief executive, Craig Bennett. ""But it's just a drop in the ocean compared to the £1bn needed annually to restore and safeguard the UK's natural assets."" The RSPB welcomed the creation of a National Forest for the north of England, saying it was a ""huge opportunity"" to bring back nature and tackle the climate emergency. ""The creation of a National Forest, if done right, has the potential to be both a nature recovery powerhouse and a beacon for the north of England,"" said RSPB director of conservation Mike Clarke.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Anna Sorokin: Fake heiress released from US prison,"Anna Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy socialite named Anna Delvey, was released from prison on Thursday, according to US media reports. She was found guilty in 2019 of theft of services and grand larceny, after convincing banks and hotels that she was an heiress with millions of dollars at her disposal. Now freed, Sorokin faces deportation to Germany, her native country. She has been held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since her release from prison. In a statement, ICE said that Sorokin ""has been ordered removed from the United States and is in the process of being repatriated to Germany."" Sorokin's story captivated the public, and she became known as the ""Soho grifter"" after she lived a lavish lifestyle in New York City, staying in expensive hotels and dining at exclusive restaurants without paying her bills. She funded her lifestyle by writing bad checks, using fake bank statements, and taking out loans in other people's names. Sorokin's trial was a media sensation, and she was portrayed as both a glamorous scammer and a victim of her own ambition. Her lawyer argued that she had intended to pay back the money she owed, but her plans had fallen through. The judge in the case, however, said that Sorokin had ""knowingly and intentionally defrauded numerous financial institutions and individuals."" Sorokin's release from prison has reignited interest in her story. She has been interviewed by numerous media outlets, and there are plans for a television series and a book about her life. It remains to be seen whether Sorokin will be able to rebuild her life after prison, but her story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of living a lie.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Car immobiliser easy to crack, say researchers","Vehicles made by Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and Chrysler have been affected, the researchers from Birmingham, Newcastle and Radboud University in the Netherlands said. The team say car manufacturers must change the encryption method used, as the current system is 'outdated'. The immobiliser, a security device fitted to most modern cars, is designed to prevent a vehicle from being started if the correct key is not used. It works by using a transponder chip in the key to send a unique encrypted code to the car's engine control unit. If the code matches, the engine will start. If it doesn't, the engine will not start. However, the researchers have found that the encryption system used in many car immobilisers can be cracked, potentially letting a thief steal the car. They say that the encryption system used in many car immobilisers is based on a technique called 'rolling code'. Rolling code is a method of encryption where the code changes each time the key is used. This makes it difficult for a thief to copy the code and use it to start the car themselves. However, the researchers have found that the rolling code system used in many car immobilisers is vulnerable to a type of attack called a 'replay attack'. A replay attack is a type of attack where a thief records the encrypted code being sent from the key to the car's engine control unit. The thief can then replay the recorded code to the car's engine control unit, which will then start the car. The researchers say that car manufacturers must change the encryption method used in car immobilisers to prevent replay attacks. They say that a more secure encryption method is available, called 'challenge-response'. Challenge-response is a type of encryption where the car's engine control unit sends a challenge to the key. The key then responds with an encrypted response. If the response is correct, the engine will start. If it is not, the engine will not start. The researchers say that challenge-response is a more secure encryption method than rolling code, and that car manufacturers should adopt it to prevent replay attacks. A spokesperson for Ford said: ""We are aware of the research and are working to address the concerns raised. ""In the meantime, we recommend that our customers use a steering wheel lock or other security device to protect their vehicles."" A spokesperson for Toyota said: ""We are aware of the research and are working to develop a solution.

Cocaine smuggling: The bizarre tactics used to hide drugs,"But sneaking drugs under the noses of authorities can be a risky business, as a Colombian cocaine smuggler discovered this week. Security staff at Madrid airport apprehended him as he stepped off a flight from Bogota, with 5kg of cocaine hidden inside prosthetic buttocks he was wearing under his trousers. While this may seem like an extreme and bizarre method of drug concealment, it's just one example of the many tactics smugglers use to evade detection. In 2018, a Polish man was caught trying to smuggle 110 grams of cocaine by hiding it inside a hollowed-out loaf of bread. Another smuggler attempted to conceal cocaine in the lining of his coffin, apparently hoping that customs officials would be reluctant to open it. Food is a common hiding place for smugglers. One individual was caught trying to smuggle cocaine in frozen fish, while another used hollowed-out pineapples. Drug traffickers have even used the mail system to their advantage, sending packages of cocaine disguised as books, toys, and even clothing. Drugs have also been found concealed in items that are more difficult to search. In one case, smugglers hid cocaine in the plaster cast of a broken leg. In another, they concealed the drugs inside a prosthetic limb. And on one memorable occasion, a group of smugglers attempted to smuggle cocaine into the UK by hiding it inside a shipment of live giant African snails. The methods used to smuggle drugs are constantly evolving, as traffickers become more sophisticated in their attempts to outsmart authorities. But despite their ingenuity, smugglers often face harsh consequences if they are caught. Drug trafficking is a serious crime and can result in lengthy prison sentences. These bizarre tactics serve as a testament to the lengths that drug smugglers will go to in order to evade detection. However, the consequences of getting caught can be severe, and it's important to remember that drug smuggling is a very risky endeavor.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Chinese doctors jailed for illegal organ harvesting,"The group had tricked the families of the deceased into thinking they were making official organ donations. Between 2017 and 2018, the gang harvested organs from 25 bodies, selling them on the black market. According to the court, the organs were sold for up to £70,000 each. The gang was led by a man named Wang Xuejie, who was described as a ""master surgeon"" by police. Wang is said to have recruited other doctors and nurses to help him with the illegal operations. The group would target families who were struggling financially, offering them money in exchange for their consent to donate their loved one's organs. In one case, the gang harvested the organs of a 63-year-old woman who had died in a car accident. The woman's family was told that she had been declared brain dead and that her organs would be donated to save the lives of others. However, the organs were sold on the black market instead. The case has shocked China and raised questions about the country's organ donation system. In China, it is illegal to sell organs, and it is only legal to donate organs to registered recipients. However, there is a shortage of organs in China, and the illegal organ trade is thriving. The case has also highlighted the need for better regulation of the organ donation system in China. The government has said that it will crack down on illegal organ harvesting and that it will work to ensure that all organs are donated ethically. However, experts believe that it will be difficult to stop the illegal organ trade in China. The shortage of organs is driving up prices, and there is a lot of money to be made in the illegal trade. The government has said that it will work to educate the public about the importance of organ donation, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to stop the illegal trade. The case is a reminder of the dark side of the organ donation system in China. It is a system that is plagued by corruption and greed, and it is a system that is putting the lives of innocent people at risk.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Times and Sunday Times readership falls after paywall,"Times Online was registering about 21 million unique users a month to its front page earlier this year but the figure fell to around 12 million in recent weeks. The drop in readership has also been seen in The Sunday Times, with the number of unique users falling from about 14 million a month to just over 10 million. The fall in readership comes after both papers introduced a paywall in March, which requires users to pay a subscription fee to access the majority of their content. The move was met with criticism from some quarters, who argued that it would damage the papers' reach and influence. However, the publishers of The Times and The Sunday Times have defended the decision, arguing that it is necessary to protect the quality of their journalism. They also point out that the number of digital subscribers has increased since the paywall was introduced, suggesting that it is not deterring readers from accessing their content. The introduction of paywalls has become increasingly common in the newspaper industry in recent years, as publishers seek to find new ways to generate revenue in the face of declining print sales. However, the success of paywalls has been mixed, with some papers seeing a significant drop in readership while others have seen little or no impact. The Times and The Sunday Times are two of the most prestigious newspapers in the UK, and their decision to introduce a paywall has been closely watched by the industry. The fall in readership that they have experienced is likely to be a concern for other publishers who are considering introducing paywalls of their own. It is too early to say whether the fall in readership experienced by The Times and The Sunday Times will be permanent. However, it does suggest that publishers need to carefully consider the potential impact of paywalls on their audience before implementing them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tiananmen crash: China police 'detain suspects',"All three people in the vehicle died at the scene, according to state media, while 40 people were injured, including five in critical condition. The attack happened on Thursday evening in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Officials said the suspects belonged to ""an extremist group"". Tensions have been high in Xinjiang for years, with the Muslim Uighur minority facing severe restrictions. China's state-run news agency Xinhua initially described the incident as a ""major traffic accident"". But on Friday, the agency said police had determined it was a ""violent terror attack"". The change in language suggests the authorities believe the attack was premeditated and politically motivated. The suspects' identities and motives have not been released. But analysts say the attack fits a pattern of violence in Xinjiang that has been blamed on Uighurs seeking independence from China. Xinjiang is home to about 10 million Uighurs, a Muslim minority group who have long complained of discrimination by the Han Chinese majority. In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on Uighurs, who are seen as a potential threat to national security. Authorities have detained thousands of Uighurs in internment camps, where they are subjected to political indoctrination and forced labour. The crackdown has drawn international condemnation, with the United States calling it ""a gross violation of human rights"". But China has defended its policies, saying they are necessary to combat terrorism and extremism. The Tiananmen crash is the latest in a series of attacks in Xinjiang in recent years. In 2014, a group of Uighurs attacked a coal mine, killing 37 people. And in 2015, a suicide bombing at a market in Urumqi, the regional capital, killed at least 39 people. The attacks have raised concerns about the stability of Xinjiang and the potential for further violence. The Chinese government has vowed to crack down on terrorism and extremism, but analysts say the crackdown is unlikely to resolve the underlying tensions in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

MEPs vote for universal charger for smartphones,"The resolution passed with 582 votes in favour to 40 against. MEPs will now urge the European Commission (EC) to adopt a legislative proposal to introduce a universal charger for smartphones, tablets, e-readers, headphones, and other portable devices. The move is aimed at reducing electronic waste and making it easier for consumers to charge their devices. Currently, there are dozens of different chargers on the market, which can be confusing and wasteful. ""This is a major step towards reducing electronic waste and making life easier for consumers,"" said Alex Agius Saliba, the MEP who authored the resolution. ""We have been pushing for this for years, and we are finally seeing results."" The EC has said it is ""open"" to the idea of a universal charger. However, it has not yet committed to introducing legislation. MEPs also called for the EC to: Develop a common standard for wireless charging Encourage the use of recycled materials in chargers Make it easier for consumers to repair or replace their chargers The resolution is not binding on the EC. However, it sends a strong message that the Parliament is serious about reducing electronic waste and making it easier for consumers to charge their devices. If the EC does adopt a legislative proposal, it will need to be approved by the Parliament and the Council of the EU before it can become law. The move towards a universal charger has been welcomed by environmental groups. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) said it was a ""positive step"" that would help to reduce electronic waste. ""We urge the European Commission to take this opportunity to introduce a truly universal charger that will work for all devices,"" said EEB policy officer Diego Zorrilla. Consumer groups have also welcomed the move. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said it would make life easier for consumers and help to reduce electronic waste. ""This is a victory for consumers,"" said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens. ""We have been calling for a universal charger for years, and we are glad to see that MEPs have finally listened to our demands.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Oil prices slump on Saudi comments,"The comments by deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman are seen as a challenge to Iran. It has vowed to increase oil production following the lifting of Western sanctions. In the Bloomberg interview, the prince said Saudi Arabia would not reduce output even if it meant the price fell to $20 a barrel. This represents a significant shift in Saudi policy, which has traditionally acted as the swing producer, adjusting output to ensure a stable price. The Saudi move has been welcomed by some analysts, who argue that it could help to accelerate the rebalancing of the oil market. Global oil demand is expected to rise in the coming years, but it is likely to take some time for new production to come on stream. In the meantime, a lower oil price could encourage consumers to use more energy, which would help to reduce the glut. However, other analysts are more cautious, warning that a prolonged period of low prices could damage the global oil industry. Many oil companies are already struggling to cope with the current downturn, and a further drop in prices could lead to bankruptcies and job losses. The Saudi move is also likely to have a significant impact on the geopolitical landscape. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and its decision to flood the market with crude oil is likely to put pressure on other producers, such as Russia and Iran. It could also lead to a reassessment of the US-Saudi relationship, which has been based on close cooperation on oil policy. The impact of the Saudi move on the global economy is still uncertain. Some analysts believe that it could lead to lower inflation and higher economic growth. However, others warn that it could also lead to financial instability and a global recession. Only time will tell what the full implications of the Saudi move will be. However, it is clear that the decision to flood the market with crude oil is a major gamble that could have far-reaching consequences.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims,"Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims Colonia Dignidad was founded by former Nazi soldier Paul Schäfer in 1961. The commune, which was located 350km (220 miles) south of Santiago, was run as a secretive cult and dozens of children were reportedly abused there. Schäfer fled Chile in 1997 after being accused of child abuse. He died in Argentina in 2010 while serving a 20-year prison sentence for child abuse and other crimes. Following a visit to the site of Colonia Dignidad in 2018, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany had a ""moral responsibility"" to help the victims of the commune. He announced that Germany would provide €5m (£4.4m) in compensation to the victims. The German government has been criticized for its slow response to the Colonia Dignidad scandal. The commune was first investigated by German authorities in the 1990s, but it was not until 2018 that the German government agreed to provide compensation to the victims. The victims of Colonia Dignidad have welcomed the German government's decision to provide compensation. They say that the money will help them to rebuild their lives and to move on from the horrors that they experienced at the commune. The Colonia Dignidad scandal is a reminder of the dark history of Chile's dictatorship. The commune was a place where human rights were violated with impunity. The German government's decision to provide compensation to the victims is a welcome step towards acknowledging this dark history and helping the victims to heal. The compensation will be paid to victims who were abused at the commune between 1961 and 2005. The payments will range from €5,000 to €10,000 per victim, depending on the severity of the abuse they suffered. The German government has also said that it will provide €1m to help the victims of Colonia Dignidad to build a memorial at the site of the commune. The memorial will serve as a reminder of the horrors that took place there and will help to ensure that the victims are never forgotten. The Colonia Dignidad scandal is a reminder of the importance of human rights and the need to protect children from abuse. The German government's decision to provide compensation to the victims is a welcome step towards acknowledging this dark history and helping the victims to heal.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hungary government proposes same-sex adoption ban,"The proposed amendment would specify that ""the mother is a woman, the father is a man"" and permit only married couples to adopt children. Same-sex marriage is not recognized in Hungary, and the new provision would effectively bar same-sex couples from adopting children. Critics of the proposal argue that it is discriminatory and violates the rights of LGBTQ+ people. They also point out that there is no evidence that same-sex parents are less capable of raising children than heterosexual parents. Supporters of the amendment argue that it is necessary to protect the traditional family unit and that it is in the best interests of children to be raised by a mother and a father. They also claim that same-sex adoption could lead to confusion about gender roles and sexual orientation. The debate over same-sex adoption has been going on for decades in Hungary. In 2007, the country passed a law that banned same-sex couples from adopting children. However, the law was overturned by the Constitutional Court in 2013. The proposed amendment is expected to be debated in Hungary's Parliament in the coming weeks. It is unclear whether the amendment will pass, but it is likely to face strong opposition from LGBTQ+ rights groups and their allies. The issue of same-sex adoption is a complex one with no easy answers. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide where they stand on this issue. In addition to the legal and moral arguments, there is also a growing body of research that shows that same-sex parents are just as capable of raising children as heterosexual parents. A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that children raised by same-sex parents had similar outcomes to children raised by heterosexual parents in terms of academic achievement, social adjustment, and psychological well-being. Another study, published in the journal Child Development, found that children raised by same-sex parents were more likely to have positive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people and to be supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. These studies provide evidence that same-sex parents are just as capable of raising children as heterosexual parents. They also suggest that children raised by same-sex parents may have some advantages over children raised by heterosexual parents, such as being more tolerant and accepting of diversity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
A83 Rest and Be Thankful reopens after landslip,"Workers have been clearing 1,000 tonnes of debris from the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83 after a series of landslips. Meanwhile, the Scottish government is to host a summit for key stakeholders next week to discuss a permanent solution to the ""long-standing instability"" affecting the route. The A83 has been closed since 2 August, when heavy rain led to the collapse of part of the hillside above the road. After initially being expected to reopen within three weeks, ongoing landslips have meant it has remained closed while contractors have worked to make the area safe and remove the debris. In total, seven landslips have happened at the Rest and Be Thankful over the past fortnight. The last occurred on 8 August, affecting 150m of the hillside and blocking the road with 60,000 tonnes of debris. A team of 100 workers have been involved in the clear-up operation, which has involved using helicopter sling operations to remove larger boulders from the affected area. The full reopening of the road is expected to be delayed until next week, with works ongoing to remove all remaining debris and vegetation, as well as to check for any outstanding subsidence. Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland's north west representative, said: ""I want to thank the communities impacted by the ongoing situation for their continued patience and understanding as our team safely removes remaining debris. ""The landslips at the Rest have been challenging but the focus now is on getting the road fully reopened as quickly as possible and safely."" While the A83 has been closed, a contraflow system has been in operation on the A82 between Tarbet and Inverarnan. Drivers have also been able to use the Old Military Road as a diversion, although this has been closed on occasion due to its own landslip issues. The Scottish government will host a summit next week to discuss long-term solutions for the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been subject to numerous landslips over the years. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said: ""The Scottish government is committed to implementing a permanent engineering solution that will mitigate the risks of landslips at the Rest and Be Thankful. ""I have instructed officials to progress design work for a solution that will reduce the frequency and impact of landslips and improve resilience. ""Next week, we will bring together key stakeholders at a summit to discuss the geotechnical survey results and outline our plans to deliver a lasting solution.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Flooding and storm warnings across England,"The Environment Agency has issued flood alerts in 50 areas - 42 of which are in south-east England. Six flood warnings are in place; five for the South East, including parts of Kent, East Sussex, and Hampshire, and one in Dorset. The agency has warned that river levels are rising and could cause flooding, with heavy rain expected to continue throughout the day. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain across the south-east of England, with up to 100mm of rain expected in some areas. The warning is in place until 6pm on Tuesday. The Environment Agency is urging people to be aware of the flood risk and to take steps to protect themselves and their property.

New e-petitions website opens,"The petition.parliament.uk site is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a ""new dialogue"" with MPs and ministers. In the past, paper petitions had to be submitted to Parliament by MPs or peers, which meant that only a small number of petitions could be considered each year. The new website will allow anyone to start a petition on any issue, and if it gathers 10,000 signatures, it will be considered for debate in Parliament. The website has been launched with a number of high-profile petitions, including a call for the government to introduce a ""living wage"" and a petition to ban the sale of ivory. The government has welcomed the launch of the website, saying that it will ""give people a stronger voice in our democracy."" However, some critics have argued that the website could be used to promote frivolous or even dangerous petitions. Others have expressed concerns that the website could be used by special interest groups to lobby the government. Despite these concerns, the website is likely to be popular with the public. A recent poll found that 70% of people support the idea of an e-petitions website. The website is part of a wider government initiative to make Parliament more open and accessible. In recent years, the government has also launched a new website for submitting questions to MPs and ministers, and it has opened up the House of Commons to the public for tours and events. The launch of the e-petitions website is a significant step forward for British democracy. It will give people a new and more direct way to have their voices heard in Parliament. Here are some of the benefits of the new e-petitions website: It will make it easier for people to start and sign petitions on issues that they care about. It will open up a new dialogue between the public and MPs and ministers. It will give people a stronger voice in our democracy. The new e-petitions website is a welcome addition to British democracy.

Jermaine Jackson: 'No truth' to allegations in Michael documentary,"In Leaving Neverland, James Safechuck and Wade Robson claim they were abused by the singer as children. Mr Robson acted as a main witness for Michael Jackson at his 2005 trial, but later filed a lawsuit against the late star after claiming the testimony was given under duress from the singer. The Jackson family and the singer's estate have strongly denied the claims made in the documentary, while several of Michael Jackson's former employees have also spoken out in his defence. A statement from the estate, released after part one of the documentary aired, said: ""This so-called 'documentary' is just another rehash of stale and debunked allegations. It's pathetically one-sided and, in addition, crafted as a commercial product to be exploited for monetary gain."" The statement accused Leaving Neverland's director, Dan Reed, of pursuing ""a sensationalist and biased attack"" on Michael Jackson, ""using unvetted sources to create a salacious story."" Jermaine Jackson, Michael's older brother, has been one of the most vocal members of the family in defending his late brother. In an interview with BBC News, he said: ""To think that my brother would be accused of this is beyond comprehension. It's not true. We grew up together. I know my brother. He would never do something like that."" Jermaine Jackson also said he had spoken to Wade Robson after the 2005 trial and that Robson had told him he was not abused by Michael Jackson. ""He swore on the Bible,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""He was very adamant that he was not abused."" Since the documentary aired, Robson has given several interviews in which he has defended his decision to come forward now. He told CBS News: ""I was groomed from the age of seven. I spent every day with him at Neverland, alone with him in his bedroom, sleeping in his bed. There was no one there to protect me from him. ""I don't want any other child to go through what I went through. That's why I'm sharing my story.""

Robot used to guide surgeons through knee operations,"By Eleanor Bradford BBC Scotland Health Correspondent The technique is being tested at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where 150 patients are involved in trials. It is part of a collaboration between surgeons, bio-engineers and a US health care company and has the potential to make surgery more accurate, less invasive and quicker. The robot is called Rosa and it was originally designed to help remove brain tumours but can also be used to help carry out knee surgery. It works by using a CT scan to create an individual 3D model of a patient's knee, which the surgeon uses to plan the operation. During surgery, the robot then guides the surgeon's movements, making sure they are as precise as possible. This can reduce the risk of complications and speed up the recovery time for patients. Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Mufaddal Meghji said: ""With the current techniques that we use at the moment, we still have to do an additional small incision in the knee to put a camera inside the knee to look around and check our accuracy. ""With the robot, because of the 3D planning that we've done we don't have to do that - we can just go straight in and we're much more likely to be very accurate indeed."" The robot is also being tested in a number of other hospitals around the world and the results so far have been very promising. In one study, patients who had knee surgery using the robot had a 50% reduced risk of complications and were able to recover more quickly than those who had surgery using traditional techniques. The robot is not yet widely available but it is hoped that it will become more common in the future. If it does, it could have a major impact on the way that knee surgery is performed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Parking fine appeal success varies between council areas,"Some English councils approve only one in 10 appeals against on-street fines, while others accept nearly every one. Runnymede Council in Surrey accepted just 9% of appeals while Basildon Council in Essex approved 93%. The figures, from the RAC Foundation, show a wide variation in success rates across 159 councils surveyed. The RAC Foundation's Steve Gooding said: ""The gulf in the success rates between those councils at the top and the bottom of the table is extraordinarily wide."" He said this suggested that some councils were ""too ready to reject appeals"" and called for greater consistency. The data shows that in some areas, drivers are more likely to have their appeals rejected than others. For example, in London, only 18% of appeals were successful, compared to 49% in the West Midlands. The RAC Foundation said this could be due to a number of factors, including the way that councils interpret the rules and the amount of evidence that drivers provide in their appeals. The group is calling for councils to be more transparent about their appeals process and to provide drivers with clear guidance on how to appeal a fine. The Department for Transport said it was ""concerned"" about the variation in success rates and was working with councils to improve the appeals process. A spokesperson said: ""We have introduced a new statutory code of practice for councils to follow when handling parking appeals and will work with councils to ensure they comply with it."" The RAC Foundation's research is based on data from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, which is responsible for adjudicating parking appeals. The tribunal's data shows that the number of appeals has increased in recent years. In 2017, there were 415,000 appeals, compared to 360,000 in 2016. The RAC Foundation said this increase could be due to a number of factors, including the growing number of parking fines being issued and the increasing complexity of the appeals process. The group is calling for the government to simplify the appeals process and to make it easier for drivers to challenge unfair fines.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death,"Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death Megan Lee, 15, suffered irreversible brain damage after having an allergic reaction to food from Royal Spice in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, in 2016. She died two years later. The takeaway's owners, Mohammed Abdul Kuddus, 40, and Harun Rashid, 38, were found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence at Manchester Crown Court on Monday. The court heard that Megan had ordered a chicken tikka masala from the takeaway, which contained peanuts. She was allergic to peanuts and had made it clear to the restaurant staff when she placed her order. However, the food she received contained traces of peanuts, which triggered a severe allergic reaction. Megan's parents, Martin and Gemma, said they were ""relieved"" that the takeaway owners had been found guilty. They said: ""We can now start to try to move on with our lives, knowing that justice has been done."" The court heard that the takeaway had a history of food safety violations. In 2015, it was given a zero rating by the Food Standards Agency after inspectors found mouse droppings in the kitchen. The takeaway was also fined £5,000 for failing to properly label allergens on its menu. In a statement, the Food Standards Agency said: ""This case is a tragic reminder of the importance of food businesses taking their responsibilities seriously. Food businesses must ensure that the food they serve is safe and that they have robust systems in place to manage allergens."" The takeaway's owners have been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. They have also been banned from working in the food industry for life. Megan's death has led to calls for tougher laws on food safety. Her parents have launched a campaign called ""Megan's Law"", which calls for mandatory prison sentences for food businesses that cause death or serious injury through negligence.

EasyJet half-year loss widens on weaker pound,"The airline recorded a loss of £212m in the six months to March. That compares with a loss of £21m for the same period last year. EasyJet said the weaker pound had ""a significant impact"" on its results, as it increased the cost of buying fuel and other expenses. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: ""The first half of the year has been challenging, with the weaker pound having a significant impact on our results. We have taken action to mitigate these headwinds, including hedging our fuel costs and increasing our focus on cost control. ""We remain confident in our long-term strategy and believe that we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future."" Despite the loss, EasyJet's revenue rose by 5.6% to £2.5bn. The airline said this was driven by a 4.1% increase in passenger numbers. EasyJet also announced that it is to increase its capacity by 8% this summer. The airline said this will ""help to meet the growing demand for air travel in Europe"". The news of EasyJet's loss comes as the airline industry faces a number of challenges, including rising fuel costs, increased competition and the impact of Brexit.

Everest: Top Sherpas slam Nepal's plan to clean rubbish from mountain,"By Surendra Phuyal BBC Nepali The government says the army will be used for the task, which will cost 860 million Nepali rupees ($7.5m; £5.7m). Last year, they managed to clear about 10,000kg of waste from the region. But Kami Rita, who holds the record for the most successful Everest summits, said the plan was yet another ""publicity stunt"". ""There is no guarantee that rubbish thrown in the icefall area will not slide down again,"" he said. ""The only sustainable solution is a ban on trekkers taking oxygen cylinders above base camp."" Most climbers use bottled oxygen to help them breathe at high altitudes, and many discard their empty cylinders on the mountainside. Another veteran Sherpa guide, Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, agreed. ""This plan is impractical and a waste of taxpayers' money,"" he said. ""The army should be used for more important tasks."" The Sherpas have a long history of helping climbers on Everest, and their expertise is essential for the success of expeditions. They have been critical of the government's handling of the mountain in the past, accusing it of putting profit before safety. In 2019, they called for a limit on the number of climbers on Everest after 11 people died in a single week. The government has defended its plan, saying it is committed to cleaning up the mountain. ""We are determined to make Everest clean and safe for climbers,"" said Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai. ""We believe this plan is the best way to achieve that.""

Concern raised over changes to probation service,"Concern raised over changes to probation service By the beginning of next year, 70% of its work in England and Wales will be run by private companies. The government says the move will improve efficiency and reduce reoffending, but critics say it will lead to job losses and a drop in standards. The National Probation Service (NPS) is responsible for supervising offenders who have been released from prison or given community sentences. The government has announced plans to split the NPS into two parts. One part will be responsible for high-risk offenders, and the other will supervise low-risk offenders. The high-risk part will remain in the public sector, but the low-risk part will be outsourced to private companies. The government says the move will save money and improve efficiency. It also says that private companies will be able to offer more innovative and effective ways of supervising offenders. However, critics of the plans say they will lead to job losses and a drop in standards. They also say that private companies will be more interested in making a profit than in rehabilitating offenders. Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""This is a disaster for probation and for public safety. ""Private companies have no experience of running probation services and they will be more interested in making a profit than in rehabilitating offenders. ""This will lead to a drop in standards and an increase in reoffending."" The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents probation officers, has also criticized the plans. Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said: ""These plans are a disgrace. ""They will lead to job losses, a drop in standards and an increase in reoffending.

Coronavirus: Survey suggests business confidence at record low,"The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) survey suggests retail and construction have been among the worst hit sectors during the Covid-19 crisis. But 95% of tourism firms also reported falling confidence as the pandemic took hold. The report found that confidence levels in Scotland's business community fell to a record low during the first quarter of 2021. The SCC's Quarterly Economic Indicator (QEI) survey, which measures business confidence, fell to -42.5%, down from -19.1% in the previous quarter. This is the lowest level of confidence recorded since the survey began in 1994. The survey found that pessimism was widespread across all sectors, with particularly sharp declines in the retail, hospitality, and construction sectors. Retail confidence fell to -65.8%, down from -45.7% in the previous quarter. Hospitality confidence fell to -64.2%, down from -44.2% in the previous quarter. And construction confidence fell to -56.3%, down from -35.9% in the previous quarter. The survey also found that businesses are facing a number of challenges, including a lack of demand, rising costs, and supply chain disruptions. A net balance of -62.3% of businesses reported a decrease in demand during the first quarter of 2021, up from -45.7% in the previous quarter. A net balance of -45.7% of businesses reported an increase in costs during the first quarter of 2021, up from -35.9% in the previous quarter. And a net balance of -35.9% of businesses reported supply chain disruptions during the first quarter of 2021, up from -26.6% in the previous quarter. The SCC report concludes that the Scottish economy is facing a ""significant challenge"" as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report calls on the Scottish Government to provide further support to businesses during this difficult time. In response to the survey findings, the Scottish Government said that it was ""doing everything we can to support businesses during this challenging time."" The government pointed to a number of measures it has introduced to help businesses, including the £2 billion Scottish Business Loan Fund and the £2.2 billion Strategic Framework Business Fund.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty,"David Martin, the MEP responsible for its report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (Acta), said the treaty threatened civil liberties. His comments came less than three months after the previous rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned from the European Parliament due to concerns about the agreement. Martin's report is critical of Acta, saying that it would create a ""new era of Internet surveillance"" and could lead to ""unjustified and disproportionate"" restrictions on online activity. He also said that the treaty would be ineffective in combating counterfeiting, and could actually make the problem worse. The European Parliament is set to vote on Acta in July, and Martin's report is likely to be a key factor in the outcome. If the Parliament votes against the treaty, it will be referred back to the European Commission for further negotiations. The European Commission has defended Acta, saying that it is necessary to protect intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting. However, critics say that the treaty goes too far, and could have a negative impact on fundamental freedoms. The debate over Acta has been highly divisive, with strong arguments on both sides. It remains to be seen whether the European Parliament will approve the treaty, or whether it will be sent back to the Commission for further negotiations. In the meantime, the controversy over Acta is likely to continue. Critics of the treaty have vowed to fight against it, and there is a growing movement of support for their cause. It is possible that the debate over Acta could even lead to a wider discussion about the future of intellectual property rights in the digital age.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Nuisance calls out of control, says taskforce","It also wants company directors to be held responsible for unwanted phone calls from their businesses. The taskforce has recommended that the threshold at which regulators are able to take action against nuisance calls should be lowered, and that the maximum fine for making such calls should be increased to £500,000. The government has welcomed the taskforce's recommendations, and has said that it will consider them carefully. The taskforce was set up in 2021 to tackle the issue of nuisance calls, which have become a major problem in the UK. In 2020, there were an estimated 4.5 billion nuisance calls made in the UK, with each person receiving an average of 10 calls per month. Nuisance calls can have a significant impact on people's lives. They can be disruptive, annoying, and even distressing. In some cases, they can also lead to financial loss. The taskforce's recommendations are aimed at tackling the problem of nuisance calls in a number of ways. First, the taskforce recommends that the threshold at which regulators are able to take action against nuisance calls should be lowered. This would mean that regulators would be able to take action against companies that make even a small number of nuisance calls. Second, the taskforce recommends that the maximum fine for making nuisance calls should be increased to £500,000. This would send a strong message to companies that making nuisance calls is not acceptable. Third, the taskforce recommends that company directors should be held responsible for nuisance calls made by their businesses. This would mean that directors could be held personally liable for the fines imposed on their companies. The government has welcomed the taskforce's recommendations, and has said that it will consider them carefully. The government has also said that it is committed to tackling the problem of nuisance calls. If the government implements the taskforce's recommendations, it could have a significant impact on the problem of nuisance calls in the UK. The recommendations would make it easier for regulators to take action against companies that make nuisance calls, and would also send a strong message that such calls are not acceptable.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Intensive care demand surged at peak of crisis,"An official report on Covid cases requiring intensive care shows demand peaked on 29 March, with 29 patients admitted in a single day. Admissions remained close to the this level for the next four days, before falling away steadily to reach a low of four patients on 10 May. The 11-page report, published by Public Health Scotland, found the median age for admissions for Covid-related critical care was 67, and around two thirds of patients were male. In total, 1,002 Covid cases were admitted to intensive care in Scotland between 23 February and 15 June. Of those, 63% were discharged from hospital, and 37% died. The report's authors conclude: ""Critical care admissions peaked on 29th March following which there was a slow but sustained decline in the number of admissions throughout April and May. ""From 1st June, the number has remained low, with only one patient admitted to a critical care bed in the last three weeks. ""These data show that the critical care surge capacity created was not required in Scotland."" However, Prof. Andrew Elder, vice-president of the Scottish Intensive Care Society, warned: ""The report is in effect a post mortem on the first critical phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and shows that the dreadful predictions made by some who even suggested using the car park at Hampden Stadium as an ICU did not come about. ""NHS staff across Scotland should take heart from this, and from the fact that those who do become critically unwell have an extremely good chance of recovering."" The report's findings come a month after the mortality data from the first wave of the pandemic in June were published, which revealed 85% of Covid-19 deaths had occurred in care homes. A separate report by the National Records of Scotland last month showed that at the peak of the crisis in mid-April, 80.5% of all deaths in Scotland were caused by Covid-19. On Wednesday, the Scottish government's daily update showed there had been 147 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the previous 24 hours - the highest UK total since 30 May.

Oxford top of global university rankings,"Oxford top of global university rankings By Sean Coughlan BBC News family and education correspondent The annual Times Higher Education world rankings put Cambridge in third place and Imperial College London in tenth. But there is a warning from the compilers of the rankings that other UK universities may struggle to keep up with their international rivals as government spending cuts begin to bite. Oxford's top position is a return to its pre-pandemic ranking, after falling to second place last year. The rankings are based on a range of factors, including teaching quality, research output, industry links and international outlook. Oxford was praised for its strong record in research, with 98% of its research being judged to be ""world-leading"" or ""internationally excellent"". The university also has a high proportion of international staff and students, which helped to boost its score for ""international outlook"". Cambridge remains in the top three, with its strong performance in teaching quality, research and industry links. Imperial College London moves up one place to tenth, with its strengths in engineering and technology. However, there are concerns that other UK universities may struggle to keep up with their international rivals in the future. The government has cut funding for higher education in recent years, and universities are facing increasing competition from international institutions. The Times Higher Education rankings editor, Phil Baty, said that UK universities need to ""adapt and innovate"" to remain competitive. ""UK universities have been hit hard by the pandemic and government spending cuts,"" he said. ""They need to find ways to become more efficient and to generate more income from other sources."" Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said that the rankings are a ""testament to the continued strength of the UK higher education sector"". However, it warned that the government's funding cuts are ""putting our global competitiveness at risk"". ""We need the government to invest in higher education so that we can continue to deliver world-class teaching and research,"" said a Universities UK spokesperson.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Israeli 'Freedom is basic' niqab advert criticised,"By George Pierpoint, BBC Newsand Osob Elmi, BBC News The ad, for clothing brand Hoodies, opens with a caption reading ""Is Iran here?"" and depicts a young woman wearing a black niqab looking over her shoulder with the eyes cut out. It continues with a series of images of women with varying skin colours and body shapes wearing the same garment. Chief executive of the Muslim Council of Britain Zara Mohammed said the advert was ""deeply offensive"" and ""plays on the worst stereotypes of Muslim women"". ""Ultimately, determining what women can and cannot wear is dangerous territory because it can quickly lead to restricting women's choices and autonomy,"" she added. ""This is about so much more than a garment of clothing; it's about respecting women's choices and upholding their rights to live free from discrimination and prejudice."" The company behind the advert, Hoodies, is owned by Israeli street artists known as Broken Fingaz Crew. In a statement, the artists said that they created the advert to ""provoke thought"" about the issue of freedom of expression. ""Hoodies is not about fashion,"" they said. ""It's about freedom of expression. We believe that everyone has the right to wear what they want, regardless of their religion or cultural background."" The advert has been met with mixed reactions online. Some have praised the artists for their creativity and for highlighting the issue of freedom of expression. Others have condemned the advert as offensive and islamophobic. The debate over the niqab is a complex one. In some countries, such as France and Belgium, it is banned in public places. In other countries, such as the UK and the US, it is legal to wear the niqab, but it is often met with public hostility. The niqab is a garment that covers the face and body, leaving only the eyes exposed. It is worn by some Muslim women as a symbol of modesty and religious devotion. However, it has also been associated with extremism and oppression. The issue of whether or not to ban the niqab in public places is a contentious one. There are strong arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to ban the niqab is a political one.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
SNP conference: Sturgeon pledges childcare 'revolution',"The new SNP leader unveiled the ambitious plans at the party's conference in Perth. It would see the number of free hours increase from 16 to 30 every week. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to give every child in Scotland ""the best possible start in life"" and said that the policy would help to close the poverty-related attainment gap. The policy is expected to cost £1.4 billion a year and would be funded by increasing taxes on high earners. It is a key part of the SNP's manifesto for the upcoming Scottish Parliament election in May 2021. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Childcare is a vital part of our economy and our society. It allows parents to work and contribute to the economy, and it gives children the best possible start in life. ""But for too many families, childcare is simply too expensive. That's why I'm announcing today that the SNP will introduce a childcare revolution in Scotland. ""We will increase the number of free childcare hours from 16 to 30 every week. This will make a real difference to families across the country. It will help parents to get back to work, and it will give children the best possible start in life."" The policy has been welcomed by childcare providers and parents alike. The Scottish Childminding Association said that it would be a ""game-changer"" for families. One parent, Sarah Smith, said: ""This is fantastic news. It will make a huge difference to our family. I'm a single parent and I work full-time. I've been struggling to pay for childcare, and I've had to reduce my hours at work. ""This policy will give me the flexibility to work full-time and still be able to afford to look after my child. It's a huge relief."" The policy is expected to be a key battleground in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.

At what age do you feel you have reached adulthood?,"Nationwide's study of 2,000 over-18s found more than one in 10 did not think of themselves as fully fledged grown-ups until they reached the age of 27. This suggests that the traditional view of adulthood being reached at 18 is outdated, and that people are taking longer to feel like they have fully matured. There are a number of factors that may have contributed to this change. One is the increasing complexity of modern life. Young people today face a more challenging job market, higher levels of debt, and a more complex social landscape than their parents did. This can make it difficult for them to feel like they have their lives together, even if they have reached the age of 18. Another factor is the rise of social media. Social media can create a sense of comparison and competition, which can make young people feel like they are not measuring up. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, which can make it difficult to feel like an adult. Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of when adulthood is reached. Some people may feel like adults at 18, while others may not feel like they have fully matured until they are in their 30s or even 40s. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide when they feel like they have reached adulthood. However, the Nationwide study suggests that the traditional view of adulthood being reached at 18 is outdated. Young people today are taking longer to feel like they have fully matured, and this is likely due to a number of factors, including the increasing complexity of modern life and the rise of social media. It is important to remember that there is no right or wrong answer to the question of when adulthood is reached. Everyone develops at their own pace, and there is no need to compare yourself to others. If you are not feeling like an adult yet, don't worry. You will get there eventually.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Shoreham air crash pilot 'flew too low' at Southport airshow,"Southport Airshow said the Jet Provost T5 the BBC has established was piloted by Mr Hill was seen too close to the ground during its display at the event on 28 August. It said that Mr Hill had flown the aircraft below the minimum safe height at the time of the crash. A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) report into the accident found that Mr Hill had flown the aircraft ""below the published minimum safe altitude during the manoeuvre, contrary to the display authorisation issued by Southport Airshow"". The report also found that Mr Hill had not been properly briefed on the risks of flying the aircraft below the minimum safe height. The CAA said that Mr Hill had ""failed to maintain a safe height above the ground"" and that this was ""a contributory factor to the accident"". The report also found that the air traffic control (ATC) service provided by Southport Airshow was ""inadequate"" and that the ATC staff had not been properly trained. The CAA said that the ATC staff had ""failed to provide the pilot with adequate information and guidance about the minimum safe height"" and that this was ""a contributory factor to the accident"". The CAA has made a number of recommendations to Southport Airshow and the ATC service provider in order to prevent a similar accident from happening again. These recommendations include: Revising the display authorisation to ensure that it clearly states the minimum safe height for the display Providing the pilot with a more detailed briefing on the risks of flying the aircraft below the minimum safe height Improving the training of the ATC staff Providing the ATC staff with better information about the minimum safe height Southport Airshow said that it had accepted the CAA's recommendations and that it would be implementing them.

Arterton, who has starred in films such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Quantum of Solace, said she was ""thrilled"" to be taking on the role. ""Nell Gwynn is a fascinating character,"" she said. ""She was a woman of her time, but she was also ahead of her time. She was a successful actress, a mistress to the king, and a woman who spoke her mind."" Arterton said she was particularly drawn to Gwynn's ""wit and intelligence."" ""She was a very clever woman who used her intelligence to get ahead in life,"" she said. ""She was also a very funny woman, and I think that comes across in the play.""

Italy's Giuseppe Conte tells populist leaders: 'Stop fighting or I'll quit',"Mr Conte said the parties must ""honour the government's obligations"" or he would ""simply end my mandate"". The fractious year-old coalition of the League, the far-right party of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, and the populist Five Star Movement, headed by former Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, has been on the verge of collapse for weeks. On Tuesday, Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, repeated his call for fresh elections, saying the coalition was ""finished... beyond repair"". His comments came after the League failed in an attempt to pass a motion of no confidence in Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli from the Five Star Movement. Di Maio has accused Salvini of seeking to ""destroy"" the government and has said that Five Star will not be ""blackmailed"". He has also said that the government should be allowed to continue until its term expires in 2023. The coalition has been riven by disagreements over a range of issues, including immigration, the economy and Europe. Salvini has been a vocal critic of the EU and wants to renegotiate Italy's membership. Five Star, on the other hand, has a more pro-European stance. The crisis in the coalition has raised concerns about Italy's political stability and the future of its membership of the eurozone. The country is already struggling with a high level of public debt and a weak economy. If the coalition collapses, it could lead to fresh elections and a period of political instability. This could damage Italy's economy and its relationship with the EU. Conte has said that he is ""determined"" to keep the government together, but it is unclear whether he will be able to do so. The parties have until 20 August to reach an agreement or the government will collapse. The Italian President, Sergio Mattarella, has said that he will not allow Italy to become ungovernable and has warned that he will not hesitate to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections if necessary.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales,"Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales By Matt Lloyd BBC Wales More than 50% of snake, newt and toad species are under threat globally, conservationists have said. In Wales, common lizards are the only reptiles that are not considered a priority for conservation action. But adders, slow-worms, and grass snakes are all ""of conservation concern"", while the natterjack toad has undergone severe population decline. Efforts are underway to help these species. The Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales is appealing for volunteers to help survey reptiles and amphibians. The survey is part of a larger project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, which aims to create a network of homes for wildlife across south and west Wales. The trust's conservation officer, Katie-jo Luxton, said: ""Reptiles and amphibians are an important part of our ecosystem. ""For example, adders help to control rodent populations, while grass snakes eat small mammals and birds. ""They are also a food source for other animals, such as foxes and buzzards."" The trust's survey will help to identify where reptiles and amphibians are found, and to assess the threats they face. This information will then be used to develop conservation plans to help these species. Ms Luxton said: ""We need volunteers to help us with this survey. It's a great opportunity to learn more about these fascinating creatures and to help us to protect them."" Volunteers will be trained to identify reptiles and amphibians, and to record their sightings. They will also be asked to collect data on the habitat where they see these animals. The survey will run from April to September. Anyone who is interested in volunteering can contact the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales. In addition to the survey, the trust is also working to create new homes for reptiles and amphibians. This includes creating ponds for toads and newts, and creating log piles and stone walls for snakes and lizards. Ms Luxton said: ""We hope that by creating new homes for these animals, we can help to increase their populations and to ensure their long-term survival.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Honour of Kings: China's most vilified online game,"By Timothy McDonald Business Reporter, BBC News Access to Honour of Kings is now restricted to one hour a day for children aged under 12 and two hours for children between 12 and 18. The limits were announced by Tencent, the Chinese gaming giant behind the title, in response to growing concerns about gaming addiction among young people. Honour of Kings is one of the most popular mobile games in the world, with over 100 million daily active users. However, it has also been the subject of much controversy, with critics arguing that it is addictive and harmful to children. Tencent has defended the game, saying that it has taken steps to address the issue of addiction. In addition to the new time limits, the company has also introduced a number of other measures, such as limiting the amount of money that children can spend on in-game purchases. However, some experts believe that the new measures do not go far enough. They argue that the time limits are too lenient and that the game should be banned for children altogether. The debate over Honour of Kings is part of a wider discussion about the impact of gaming on children. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the amount of time that children spend playing video games, and the potential effects of this on their physical and mental health. Some studies have suggested that excessive gaming can lead to a number of problems, including addiction, obesity, and sleep deprivation. However, other studies have found that gaming can also have positive benefits, such as improving cognitive skills and social development. The debate over the impact of gaming on children is likely to continue for some time. In the meantime, parents should be aware of the potential risks and benefits of gaming, and should set limits on their children's gaming time. Tencent's new time limits on Honour of Kings are a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. The company should consider banning the game for children altogether, or at least reducing the time limits further.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Cambridge homeless man Raymond Boyle's killer, 18, jailed","Jack Robinson stamped on 53-year-old Raymond Boyle's head and back, in Jesus Green last June. He dragged him unconscious to the River Cam, where his body was found the following day. On Friday, Robinson, 18, was convicted of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years. The court was told that Boyle, who was originally from County Down, had been sleeping rough in Cambridge for a number of months at the time of his death. Witnesses described how Robinson had been drinking all day and was ""in a rage"" before launching his brutal attack on Boyle, who was unarmed and had done nothing to provoke him. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Boyle's sister said: ""My brother was a gentleman. He always had time for others and never had a bad word to say about anyone. He did not deserve what happened to him."" Detective Inspector Emma Whitting, who led the investigation, said: ""This was a senseless and brutal act of violence that has robbed a family of a loved one. Our thoughts are with Raymond's family and friends at this difficult time."" Robinson had denied murder, claiming that he had acted in self-defense. However, the jury rejected his account and convicted him by a majority of 11 to one. In sentencing Robinson, Judge David Farrell said: ""This was a sustained and violent attack on a defenseless man who was sleeping on the streets. You have shown no remorse for your actions and I am satisfied that you are a dangerous offender."" Robinson's conviction is a reminder of the dangers faced by homeless people in the UK. According to the charity Crisis, there are over 4,000 people sleeping rough on the streets of England on any given night. Many of these people are vulnerable to violence and abuse.

MP Yeo cleared by standards watchdog,"The Tory MP was secretly filmed by Sunday Times investigators posing as representatives of a fictional energy company seeking to hire his services. The paper said he had suggested charging up to £7,000 for a day's work, and had offered to use his parliamentary status to ""bang the drum"" for the company. In a statement, Mr Yeo said he had ""fully co-operated"" with the investigation and had ""nothing to hide"". He said he was ""completely confident"" that he had not broken any rules. The Standards Commissioner is an independent watchdog that investigates allegations of breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. It can recommend sanctions, including suspension from Parliament. In its report, the Commissioner said that there was ""no evidence"" that Mr Yeo had breached the MPs' code of conduct. It said that he had not used his parliamentary status to lobby for the company, and that he had not charged for any work that he had not carried out. The Commissioner did, however, find that Mr Yeo had ""failed to declare"" his meeting with the Sunday Times investigators. He said that this was a ""minor breach"" of the MPs' code of conduct, but that it did not warrant any further action. Mr Yeo welcomed the Commissioner's findings, saying that they ""vindicated"" his position. He said he was ""pleased"" that the investigation had been ""thorough and impartial"". The Sunday Times said it stood by its story, and that it believed Mr Yeo had ""abused his position"" as an MP. The case is a reminder of the importance of MPs following the MPs' code of conduct. The code is designed to ensure that MPs act in the public interest, and that they do not use their position for personal gain. The Commissioner's findings will be seen as a blow to the Sunday Times, which has been campaigning for tougher action against MPs who are alleged to have broken the MPs' code of conduct. The case is also likely to raise questions about the role of the Standards Commissioner. Some critics have argued that the Commissioner is too lenient on MPs, and that it is not doing enough to uphold the MPs' code of conduct.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Actors, artists and the Canadian armed forces are among those who have shared supportive pictures. American singer-songwriter John Legend was one of the high-profile figures who showcased his support for the LGBT community by sharing an image of himself wearing a shirt emblazoned with the rebranded logo. Canadian Armed Forces also tweeted an image of a photomontage, featuring images of rainbow-clad military personnel emblazoned with the term ""Proud Boys"". They tweeted: ""There is no place for hate in the @CanadianForces. We stand with the #LGBT community."" Social media users are being urged to get involved and change their display pictures and to use the hashtags #ProudBoys and #ProudBoysUSA to prevent hate groups from promoting their messages. The group's name has been hijacked by LGBT groups and others online after a recent incident between members of the far-right group and protesters in Portland, Oregon. The group gained notoriety after its participation in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Proud Boys is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group has denied being white supremacist, but it has ties to white nationalists and has frequently engaged in violence. The group originated from the street brawls of Portland, Oregon, with members providing security for white supremacist speakers such as Gavin McInnes.

Birmingham bin strike: Council 'backtracking on deal',"Unite said the council was sending out refuse trucks without ""leading hands"", who operate at the back of vehicles.

""The council is backtracking on the deal that was agreed,"" said John Richards, Unite's regional officer. ""We're not going to accept that.""

It said it had been ""engaging constructively"" with the union and had offered a ""fair and reasonable"" pay deal. ""We are committed to finding a resolution to this dispute and we urge Unite to reconsider its position,"" said a council spokesperson. The strike is causing disruption across Birmingham, with rubbish piling up in the streets. The council has said it is doing everything it can to minimise the impact on residents, but it has warned that the strike could continue for some time. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial disputes in the UK. Workers in a number of sectors, including rail, transport, and education, have gone on strike in recent months in protest at pay and conditions. The government has said it is ""disappointed"" by the strike action and has urged unions to work with employers to find a resolution. However, unions have said that they are not prepared to accept below-inflation pay offers. The strikes are a sign of growing discontent among workers in the UK. The cost of living crisis has put a strain on household budgets, and many workers are feeling that their wages are not keeping pace with inflation.

Council demanded payment card details via email,"Islington Council had required residents to share the security code from the rear of their cards, as well as their card number and expiry date, before being able to access services including paying council tax or reporting repairs. The council said these details were required to provide an extra layer of security as residents were able to set up accounts to view and pay their bills without registering a password. ""This is an optional process and residents can still make payments via our website, phone or in person without providing these details,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. However, once shared, the information could potentially have been used by fraudsters to make purchases online. ""Sharing the three-digit CVV number, which is used to verify card payments online and over the phone, is never a good idea,"" said David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky. ""Even if your council asks for it, it should raise an alarm bell. There are far more secure ways to provide additional authorisation.""

A freedom of information request by the BBC revealed that Islington Council had received 162 complaints from residents about data security since 2019. However, the council insisted that no payment card details had been compromised as a result of the email demand. ""Protecting residents' personal data and money is of paramount importance to us and we would never knowingly put residents' data at risk,"" the spokesperson said. The council also said it was ""committed to transparency"" and had been ""open and honest"" about the process used to verify residents' identities.

But on Tuesday, the accolade went to a little lane in the Welsh town of Harlech. The new steepest street, Ffordd Pen Llech, has a gradient of 37.45%, compared to Baldwin Street's 34.8%. Dunedin Mayor Aaron Hawkins took the news with good humor, joking that he would be sending a ""wee bit of coal"" to Harlech to help them ""keep their fires burning"". ""We're not going to begrudge them the title,"" Hawkins said. ""We've had a good run, and it's time for someone else to have a turn."" Baldwin Street has been a popular tourist attraction for years, with people flocking from all over the world to see the ""steepest street in the world."" But locals say they're not too worried about losing the title. ""It's still a pretty steep street,"" said one resident. ""And it's still a lot of fun to walk up and down."" Others agreed, saying that the title didn't really matter. ""It's still a beautiful street, and it's still a part of our community,"" said another resident. ""We're not going to let a little thing like this change that."" In fact, some people say that losing the title could actually be a good thing for Dunedin. ""It might make us more unique,"" said one resident. ""We're not just the steepest street in the world anymore. We're the second steepest."" Whatever happens, Dunedin residents are determined to make the most of their city's unique feature. ""We're proud of Baldwin Street,"" said Mayor Hawkins. ""And we're going to keep celebrating it, no matter what."" In the meantime, Harlech residents are enjoying their newfound fame. ""It's great to be the new home of the steepest street in the world,"" said one resident. ""We're hoping it will bring more tourists to our town."" Only time will tell whether Harlech can keep its title. But for now, the Welsh town is enjoying its moment in the spotlight.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Tate Britain hits £45m renovation target,"Nine of the building's gallery rooms are being refurbished, as are the entrance area and other public spaces. The target was reached with a £5m donation from the Dorset Foundation, set up by the late philanthropist Sir John Paul Getty Jr. Tate's director Maria Balshaw said: ""This £45m fundraising success is a magnificent achievement and I am enormously grateful to all of our donors for their incredible support. ""This major refurbishment will transform the visitor experience and enable us to share more of the national collection of British art with our audiences. We can't wait to welcome visitors back to Tate Britain in 2023."" The redevelopment will include new artworks and displays, as well as improved accessibility and facilities. It is the first major refurbishment of the building since it opened in 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. The gallery is home to works by some of the UK's most famous artists, including JMW Turner, John Constable and Francis Bacon. The renovation project is expected to be completed in 2023. The Dorset Foundation is a charitable trust that supports a wide range of causes, including the arts, education and healthcare. Its donation to Tate Britain is the largest single donation the gallery has ever received. Sir John Paul Getty Jr was an American billionaire who lived in the UK for many years. He was a passionate collector of art and donated many works to Tate Britain. He died in 2003 and left a large bequest to the Dorset Foundation. The foundation's donation to Tate Britain will help to ensure that the gallery can continue to share its world-class collection with the public for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tropical forests 'better managed',"By Richard Black Environment correspondent, BBC News The area under some form of sustainable management plan increased by about 50% over the period; but about 90% of tropical forest is still managed under no plan at all. In addition, the researchers highlight three main areas of concern: - Deforestation: Primary forest loss increased by 40%, with the vast majority of it in the tropics. - Fragmentation: Forests are increasingly being broken up into ever-smaller blocks, which can damage their ecological function. - Species on the move: Major tree species are moving towards the poles at faster rates than ever - about 4.2km per decade on average since the early 2000s. This could have major implications for the functioning of forest ecosystems. The study used a range of publicly available data, including high-resolution satellite images. Some of this is available for free, which enabled the researchers to repeat previous assessments and see how the situation was changing. ""We're trying to track the state of the world's forests on the basis of the best available information,"" Prof Hansen told BBC News. ""It's not perfect and there are gaps, but it's the first consistent global picture,"" he said. The paper's lead author, Prof Nate McDowell of the University of Virginia, told BBC News: ""One of the striking things, particularly in the tropics, is the fragmentation of the forest. ""We are seeing this pretty substantial increase over time. And this is related to deforestation, and it's also related to the development of infrastructure - roads and agriculture. ""These fragmentation effects can lead to a suite of negative impacts on the forest, affecting things like biodiversity, carbon storage and hydrological function,"" he explained. The research team say their findings show that there has been limited progress towards implementing sustainable forest management in the tropics - but they are hopeful that the information they have provided could strengthen global efforts to protect the world's forests. ""Our results suggest the international community still has a long way to go in reaching its goal of sustainable forest management,"" said Prof McDowell. ""But they also highlight the fact that there have been some positive changes, and they provide evidence that could be used to further improve tropical forest management.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Artist's designs for Alabama church bombing window on display,"The bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan was a new low in the fight for civil rights. As news spread around the world, the international community was horrified, and the FBI launched a massive investigation. In the aftermath of the bombing, the congregation of the 16th Street Baptist Church was determined to rebuild. They commissioned a new stained-glass window to replace the one that had been destroyed. The window, designed by artist John T. Riddle, Jr., was unveiled in 1964. Riddle's window is a powerful and moving work of art. It depicts the events of the bombing, as well as the aftermath of the tragedy. The window is a reminder of the senseless violence that occurred that day, and it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing remains one of the most heinous crimes of the civil rights era. Riddle's window serves as a reminder of that day, and it is a powerful symbol of hope and renewal. In addition to the window, the church also commissioned a new set of bells, which were cast from the metal of the original bells that had been destroyed in the bombing. The new bells were dedicated in 1965, and they have been ringing ever since. The 16th Street Baptist Church has become a national historic landmark, and it is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. The church is a reminder of the civil rights movement, and it is a symbol of hope and reconciliation. The church bombing is still a painful memory for many people in Birmingham, but the city has made great strides in race relations since that day. The city has elected its first black mayor, and it has a diverse population that is working together to build a better future. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing was a tragedy, but it also helped to galvanize the civil rights movement. The church is a reminder of the progress that has been made, and it is a symbol of hope for the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Deepfake queen prompts 200-plus complaints to Ofcom,"The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. But commentators said the jokes went too far and trivialised the issue. Ofcom said the complaints were about the use of the technology to portray Her Majesty as a ""puppet"", making offensive remarks, and performing sexual acts. The regulator said it was assessing the complaints against its broadcasting rules before deciding whether to launch a formal investigation. The programme was part of a two-part series called The Age of the Algorithm, which examined the impact of artificial intelligence on society. In the programme, a deepfake of the Queen was used to deliver a speech at the opening of Parliament, in which she made a number of outrageous claims, including that she had abolished the monarchy and nationalised all the banks. The BBC said the programme was intended to be a ""thought-provoking and entertaining"" look at the potential dangers of deepfake technology. ""The programme was not intended to be a factual account of events, and we believe that the use of a deepfake of the Queen was a legitimate way to explore the issue of fake news,"" a BBC spokesperson said. ""We understand that some viewers found the programme to be offensive, and we apologise for any offence caused."" However, the programme was met with widespread criticism, with many commentators accusing the BBC of trivialising the issue of fake news. ""This was a crass and irresponsible stunt by the BBC,"" said James Ball, a technology reporter for The Guardian. ""It's one thing to use deepfake technology to make a point about the dangers of fake news, but it's quite another to use it to mock the Queen."" ""The BBC should be ashamed of itself for this,"" said Richard Eden, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph. ""This was a gratuitous attack on the monarchy and a betrayal of public trust."" The Ofcom complaints are the latest in a series of controversies over the use of deepfake technology. In 2018, a deepfake of former US President Barack Obama was used to create a video in which he appeared to make racist and sexist remarks. The video was widely shared on social media, and it raised concerns about the potential for deepfake technology to be used to spread misinformation and propaganda. Ofcom has previously warned broadcasters about the need to be responsible when using deepfake technology. In 2019, the regulator published a report on the use of deepfakes in the media, which said that broadcasters should take steps to ensure that audiences are aware that they are watching a deepfake, and that the content is not presented as being real.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Islamic State claims Kabul's latest deadly attacks,"On Wednesday, 48 people were killed in the bombing of an education centre. Most of them were students studying for university entrance exams. The attack, the deadliest in Kabul since the US withdrawal a year ago, has been claimed by Islamic State. The group said in a statement that it had targeted ""a gathering of apostates"". The attack was the latest in a series of bombings targeting civilians in Afghanistan. In May, a bomb attack on a mosque in Kunduz killed at least 33 people. In April, a bomb attack on a hospital in Kabul killed at least 25 people. The Taliban have condemned the latest attack, calling it a ""heinous crime"". However, the group has been accused of failing to provide adequate security for civilians. The US has also condemned the attack, calling it a ""horrific act of violence"". The attack has raised concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan. The Taliban have been unable to stamp out the threat from Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks in recent months. The attack has also highlighted the plight of Afghan civilians, who have been bearing the brunt of the violence in the country. According to the United Nations, more than 24,000 civilians have been killed or injured in Afghanistan since 2015. The attack has also raised questions about the international community's role in Afghanistan. The US and its allies withdrew from the country a year ago, after 20 years of war. The withdrawal has left the Taliban in control of the country, and has raised concerns about the future of Afghanistan. The attack is a reminder of the challenges facing Afghanistan. The country is still struggling to recover from decades of war, and the Taliban are struggling to provide security for civilians. The international community has a role to play in helping Afghanistan to overcome these challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Couple who met on Bardsey Island to be its new wardens,"Mari Huws, 27, and Emyr Glyn Owen, 33, will be looking after Bardsey Island off the Llŷn Peninsula from September. The couple replace Chris and Beca Williams, who were the island's wardens for over a decade. Mari, a former primary school teacher from Gaerwen, on Anglesey, and Emyr, a freelance forestry worker from Beddgelert in Gwynedd, met on Bardsey in 2018 while they were both volunteering for the island's conservation charity, The Bardsey Island Trust. They were drawn to the island's unique atmosphere and natural beauty and have been returning regularly ever since. Now, they are excited to take on the role of wardens and play their part in looking after this special place. ""We're both passionate about the island and its wildlife, and we believe it's important to protect and conserve this unique environment,"" said Mari. ""We're also looking forward to meeting and working with the many visitors who come to Bardsey each year."" Emyr added: ""We're grateful to Chris and Beca for all the hard work they've done over the years. They've been amazing wardens and we're looking forward to building on their legacy."" As wardens of Bardsey Island, Mari and Emyr will be responsible for a range of duties, including: Welcoming and informing visitors Maintaining the island's infrastructure Carrying out conservation work Monitoring the island's wildlife Acting as ambassadors for the island They will also be working closely with the Bardsey Island Trust to help protect and manage the island and its wildlife. Bardsey, also known as Ynys Enlli, is a small tidal island situated two miles off the tip of the Llŷn Peninsula. It is home to a variety of wildlife and is a popular destination for birdwatchers and nature lovers. Visitors to the island can also explore the ruins of a medieval monastery and a Victorian lighthouse. The island has a long and rich history, and has been inhabited for centuries. It is said that 20,000 saints are buried on the island, and it was once a place of pilgrimage. Bardsey is also a popular destination for day-trippers and campers. There is a small campsite on the island, and visitors can also stay in the former lighthouse keepers' cottages. The island is accessible by boat from Aberdaron. There are regular ferry services during the summer months, and private charters can be arranged at other times of the year.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

UK interest rates remain at record low of 0.5%,"It has also decided not to extend its quantitative easing programme, designed to stimulate lending in the economy, beyond the £375bn already spent. Rates have been at this record low since March 2009 and the Bank said it would keep them there until the end of 2016. The decision to keep rates on hold comes despite the UK economy growing at its fastest rate for a decade and inflation rising to 2.9%, above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Bank said that while the economy was growing, it was still too early to raise rates. The decision was made by a 7-2 majority, with two members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voting to raise rates by 0.25%. The Bank also said that it would continue to monitor the economy closely and would raise rates when it judged that the time was right. The decision to keep rates on hold is likely to be welcomed by businesses and consumers, as it will help to keep borrowing costs low. However, it is also likely to disappoint savers, who have seen the value of their savings eroded by low interest rates. The Bank of England's decision to keep rates on hold is a sign that it is still cautious about the UK economy. The Bank is worried that raising rates too quickly could damage the recovery. However, the Bank is also aware that keeping rates too low for too long could lead to inflation getting out of control. The Bank's decision is a balancing act between supporting the economy and keeping inflation under control. The Bank will need to continue to monitor the economy closely and make further decisions on interest rates in the months and years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

BBC World Service to lose 73 jobs,"25 jobs will go on the English-language service with news coverage reduced from 18 hours to 14 each weekday. Arts show The Strand will be axed from April next year, while World Briefing will end in the spring. The corporation said the move was necessary to make savings in the wake of a £285m funding cut recently imposed by the government. In a statement, the BBC said it was committed to continuing to provide ""high-quality, impartial and independent journalism"" to audiences around the world. ""These changes are essential to ensure that the BBC World Service remains sustainable and relevant for the future,"" the statement said. The job cuts are part of a wider restructuring of the BBC World Service, which will see the corporation focus on its digital and mobile platforms. The BBC said it was investing in new technology to improve the user experience and make its content more accessible to audiences around the world. The cuts to the English-language service will be phased in over the next year. The Strand, which has been broadcast for over 20 years, will end in April next year. World Briefing will also end in the spring. The BBC said it would continue to produce other arts and culture programming, such as The Documentary and Witness. The corporation said it was committed to ""exploring new ways to inform, educate and entertain audiences"" around the world. The cuts to the BBC World Service have been met with criticism from some quarters. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the job cuts were ""devastating"" and would ""damage the BBC's reputation for providing independent and impartial journalism"".

GP concern over Betsi Cadwaladr board's hospital plan,"But Dr Phillip Banfield said the proposals were the harsh reality of Wales' ""health care rationing debate"". Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) is the first in Wales to set out plans that would see two full-time consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology units, and a neonatal unit, at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The proposals are part of a wider plan for the future of health and care in North Wales, and were put out for public consultation on Thursday. The plans would mean four general hospitals in North Wales - Ysbyty Gwynedd, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Wrexham Maelor Hospital, and Ysbyty Maelor Wrecsam - receiving specific services in a bid to create specialist centres that provide the best possible care for patients. Under the plans, Ysbyty Gwynedd would become a planned surgical centre for heart surgery - at present the hospital only carries out emergency heart surgery - and would also specialise in cancer care and a range of other services. Ysbyty Glan Clwyd would become the region's emergency medical centre, providing acute stroke care, trauma services, and respiratory care, among other things. Wrexham Maelor Hospital would become the planned surgical centre for non-heart surgery, and would also provide renal dialysis, some of the region's breast cancer services, and would be the main centre for musculoskeletal services. Dr Phillip Banfield, chair of the BCUHB, said the new model of care would involve ""rethinking the way we deliver services"" but said the board believes it would deliver ""high quality and safe care"" for patients in North Wales. ""The plans represent the culmination of 18 months of work and listening to our staff, our patients, and our communities,"" he said. ""The plans will see us create specialist centres in North Wales that will provide the best care for patients locally and reduce the need for patients to travel outside of the region for treatment."" He added: ""The plans are designed to ensure all of our hospitals are providing the right care in the right place, and that our patients receive the best possible treatment by highly-skilled teams that specialise in a particular area."" The board said it has invested heavily in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital to provide the ""appropriate infrastructure and equipment"" necessary to deliver this new model of service provision. The plans are currently out for public consultation, and BCUHB said it will ""carefully consider"" all of the feedback it receives before making any final decisions.

Charity's 'concern' at number of beavers culled in Scotland,"The Scottish Wildlife Trust said the impact of the cull, estimated at about a fifth of the beaver population, could be ""quite significant"". But Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which authorised the cull, said it was necessary to manage the beaver population and prevent damage to the environment and infrastructure. The beavers were introduced to Scotland in the 1990s as part of a conservation project. They have since spread to other parts of the country, and their numbers have increased rapidly. Beavers are known to dam rivers, which can cause flooding and damage to property. They can also damage trees and crops. SNH said the cull was carried out in response to concerns from landowners and other stakeholders about the impact of beavers on their property and livelihoods. The cull was carried out by licensed trappers, and the beavers were killed humanely. The Scottish Wildlife Trust said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the cull. The trust said the cull could have a negative impact on the beaver population in Scotland, and could also damage the wider ecosystem. The trust said it was calling on SNH to review its beaver management strategy and to consider alternative methods of managing the beaver population, such as relocation or contraception. SNH said it would continue to monitor the beaver population in Scotland and would carry out further culls if necessary. The agency said it was committed to managing the beaver population in a way that balances the needs of conservation with the needs of landowners and other stakeholders. The debate over how to manage the beaver population in Scotland is likely to continue. The cull has highlighted the need for a long-term strategy for managing beavers in Scotland, and for a balance to be struck between the needs of conservation and the needs of landowners and other stakeholders.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scottish government funding for youth unemployment priority areas,"The Scottish government has announced the priority areas set to benefit from its youth employment strategy fund. Glasgow, Renfrewshire, North and South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde will receive a share of £9 million to tackle youth unemployment. The fund is part of the government's £100 million Youth Guarantee scheme, which aims to provide all young people in Scotland with the opportunity to access education, training or employment. The priority areas were selected based on a range of factors, including the number of young people unemployed, the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET), and the local economy. The funding will be used to support a range of projects, including: Providing pre-employment training and work experience opportunities for young people Creating new apprenticeships and other job opportunities Supporting young people to start their own businesses The Scottish government hopes that the fund will help to reduce youth unemployment and give young people the skills and experience they need to succeed in the workplace. In addition to the priority areas, the fund will also be used to support a range of national projects, such as: A new national youth employment agency A website providing information and advice on youth employment A social media campaign to promote youth employment The Scottish government is committed to tackling youth unemployment and giving young people the best possible start in life. The Youth Employment Strategy Fund is a key part of this commitment. The fund is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs for young people and help to reduce youth unemployment by up to 5%.

Read all about it: The online newspaper archive,"The British Library's newspaper archive at Colindale in north London has long been a place of pilgrimage for writers. They've come to search for historical nuggets that can illuminate the present. But now, it's all accessible online, and the first 40 million pages are available free of charge. The digitisation project began 15 years ago and has been gathering momentum ever since, thanks to technology which makes it possible to scan the fragile newsprint without causing any damage. Over 400 UK newspapers are represented, covering more than 300 years of history. In 1900, there were more than 2,500 papers published in the UK - many of them local titles that reported on events of only passing interest. But there are also the big hitters - national titles like The Times and the Daily Telegraph. And of course, the regional papers that are so essential for local historians. The library hopes to digitise every last page, and so far, they've covered 178 regional titles. They include the Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), which published the first reports of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. There's also the Liverpool Mercury, which reported on the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. And the Western Daily Press, which carried the first reports of the Bristol Bus Boycott in 1963. The digitisation project has revealed some surprising facts. In 1812, for example, there was an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Spencer Perceval. The Times reported the story, but only as a paragraph on page 3. The bigger story of the day was the execution of a group of Luddites in Yorkshire. The online archive is now a treasure trove for researchers and anyone with an interest in the past. I started my own search by looking for stories about my home town, Cardiff. I found reports of the opening of the new Cardiff Arms Park in 1921. There's a detailed account of a rugby match between Wales and New Zealand in 1935. And I found a fascinating story about the theft of a tram in 1945. I also used the archive to track down the reports of my own birth in 1952. My mother had told me that it was a difficult birth and I was lucky to survive. The Western Mail reported that I was born ""after a long and anxious confinement"". It was a relief to read that I was ""doing well"". The online archive is a remarkable resource and it's free to use.

Apostrophe ban on Devon council's new street names,"Apostrophe Ban on Devon Council's New Street Names Mid Devon District Council said its new streets had not contained apostrophes for many years, but the policy was now being formalised to ensure consistency and clarity. The decision was taken at a full council meeting on Wednesday, 25 January. The council's street naming and numbering policy states that apostrophes should not be used in street names, except in cases where the name is a direct quote or is an established historical name. The policy also states that street names should be concise, easy to spell and pronounce, and should not be offensive or confusing. The council said the removal of apostrophes from new street names would make them easier to read, understand, and navigate. The council also said it would help to avoid confusion and ambiguity, particularly in the case of streets that are named after people or places. The ban on apostrophes in Devon's new street names has been welcomed by some residents and businesses in the area. Peter Smith, a resident of Tiverton, said he supported the council's decision to remove apostrophes from street names. ""I think it's a good idea,"" Smith said. ""Apostrophes can be confusing and unnecessary. It's easier to read and understand street names without them."" Sarah Jones, a business owner in Crediton, said she also supported the council's decision. ""I think it's a good move,"" Jones said. ""It will make it easier for customers to find my business, and it will also help to create a more consistent and professional look for the area."" While some residents and businesses have welcomed the council's decision to ban apostrophes from new street names, others have expressed concerns. John Brown, a historian from Exeter, said he was concerned that the ban could lead to the loss of important historical information. ""Apostrophes can be used to indicate possession or ownership,"" Brown said. ""By removing them from street names, we could be losing valuable information about the history of our towns and villages."" The council said it understood the concerns of those who opposed the ban on apostrophes, but it believed that the benefits of the new policy outweighed the risks. ""We believe that the removal of apostrophes from new street names will make them easier to read, understand, and navigate,"" a council spokesperson said. ""We also believe it will help to avoid confusion and ambiguity, particularly in the case of streets that are named after people or places.""

Bill Clinton regrets 'three strikes' bill,"Speaking to a civil rights group, he said: ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it."" It put 100,000 more people in prison, and for longer. Clinton backed a crime bill in 1994 that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences, including drug-related crimes. ""We had a huge crime problem, more kids were being killed… crack cocaine was ravaging poor communities,"" he said. ""But it wasn't just that bad judgment, we had this idea that the way to do it is just lock 'em all up. And we did, 100,000 more people – mostly African-Americans."" The 1994 crime bill was designed to tackle a surge in violent crime in the US. The law expanded federal funding for prisons and created new mandatory minimum sentences for certain offenses. Critics argue that the law led to mass incarceration, particularly among African-Americans. Clinton's comments come as the US grapples with a renewed debate on criminal justice reform. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to reduce mass incarceration and address racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Clinton's admission of regret over the 1994 crime bill is a significant moment in the debate. It is a sign that the political consensus on mass incarceration is shifting. Clinton's comments are also a reminder that the criminal justice system is a complex issue with no easy solutions. While there is a need to address the problem of mass incarceration, it is also important to find ways to keep communities safe from crime. Clinton's comments suggest that he believes that it is possible to find a balance between these two goals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Former US intelligence analyst charged with leaks to media,"Daniel Everette Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tennessee, was arrested after allegedly providing at least 17 top secret documents to an unnamed journalist. According to the indictment, the files related to counterterrorism and intelligence gathering in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen. Hale, a former US Air Force intelligence analyst, worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) from 2013 to 2016. He is accused of accessing the classified documents on a secure computer system and then transmitting them to the journalist via an encrypted email account. The indictment alleges that Hale knew the documents were classified and that their unauthorized disclosure could cause ""grave damage"" to the United States. It also claims that he had a ""pattern of unauthorized access to classified information"" while working at the NSA. Hale's arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile prosecutions of government employees accused of leaking classified information to the media. In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about the agency's surveillance programs, prompting a global debate about privacy and security. Hale's case is different from Snowden's in that he is not accused of leaking documents to a foreign government or of directly harming national security. However, the charges against him are still serious and could result in a lengthy prison sentence. Hale's arrest has drawn criticism from some who argue that he is being prosecuted for whistleblowing. They say that the documents he leaked revealed important information about the US government's counterterrorism operations and that he was acting in the public interest. However, the government maintains that Hale violated the law by leaking classified information and that his actions put the country at risk. The trial is expected to begin in the spring of 2023. Hale's case is a reminder of the tension between the public's right to know and the government's need to protect sensitive information. It is a complex issue with no easy answers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Army morale declining, Ministry of Defence survey shows","Thirty per cent of army personnel described their morale as low - up from 26% last year - the report showed. And the proportion of personnel who said they would recommend the army as a career had also decreased, from 68% last year to 64%. The annual survey of 12,000 serving personnel, carried out by researchers at King's College London, found that morale had declined across all ranks and services. The army's chief of the general staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""We know that morale is a key factor in operational effectiveness, and we are committed to addressing the issues that are driving down morale,"" he said. The survey found that the most common factors driving down morale were: Pay and allowances Career progression Training and development Workload Leadership Sanders said the army was taking a number of steps to address these issues, including: Increasing pay and allowances Investing in career progression Improving training and development Reducing workload Strengthening leadership He said the army was also working to improve the welfare support available to personnel and their families. ""We are committed to creating an army that is attractive to serve in, and we will continue to work hard to address the issues that are affecting morale,"" he said. However, the report also found that there were some areas where morale had improved. For example, the proportion of personnel who said they were satisfied with their accommodation had increased from 72% last year to 76%. The report also found that morale was higher among personnel who had been deployed on operations. This suggests that the army's focus on operational effectiveness is having a positive impact on morale. Overall, the report provides a mixed picture of morale in the army. While there are some areas where morale has improved, there are also some areas where morale is declining. The army is taking a number of steps to address the issues that are driving down morale, but it is clear that more needs to be done.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fishing boat discards 'hard to comply with',"Boats having to land unwanted fish caught in their nets started being phased in at the start of the year, under European laws. Throwing dead fish back into the sea had previously been widespread, in part because it was easier and cheaper than bringing it ashore. But environmentalists have long argued that discarding large quantities of fish at sea damages the marine ecosystem, removing food from other creatures and making the seabed a less hospitable environment. The new rules, which have been controversial, say that discarding fish likely to survive if returned to the sea is forbidden, as well as fish that are below a set size. In the case of herring, for example, any fish below 8cm long cannot be thrown away. But the industry says it is very difficult to measure and check every catch at sea, and that the new rules could lead to extra costs and bureaucracy. ""There have been boats coming into land with [under-sized] fish but not discarding them, which used to be the legal way to do it,"" said Dr Paul Trebilco, the Marine Conservation Society's (MCS) head of policy. ""Now they're under an obligation to land and sell it."" But he acknowledged that the new rules could also lead to some fishermen disregarding them and discarding anyway. ""This regulation is a pragmatic measure to help stop the dumping of dead fish at sea and to tackle overfishing,"" he said. ""The fact is we simply cannot afford to waste fish."" Richard Benyon, the environment minister, sagte, the government was aware of the industry's concerns, and that it was ""working with the industry to help them comply with the new regulations"". He told the BBC: ""We want to make sure we have a sustainable fishing industry, and we want to make sure that the fish that come out of our seas are used in the best possible way."" The rules were first announced in 2013, and have been phased in over the course of this year. The full ban comes into force on 1 January 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ed Sheeran stops sell-out Cardiff concert for the toilet - twice,"The Grammy award winning singer halted his Saturday night set in Cardiff because he ""needed a pee"" after performing his smash hit Galway Girl. Then three songs later Sheeran stopped in the middle of singing Photograph, telling the packed Principality Stadium crowd: ""I'm going for another wee."" Sheeran, 30, has previously spoken of his embarrassing bladder problems and in his 2017 track Castle On The Hill, he sings about ""having to pee"" during a date. After he left the stage for the second time on Saturday, his backing singers began playing a cover of Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger. But Sheeran returned after about three minutes to finish his set, jokingly telling the crowd: ""I'm not leaving you again. You're stuck with me now."" He added: ""Whoever thought of putting portable toilets so far away? How do you have a site this big with a stage this big and the toilets are a 15-minute walk away? ""I'm going to have to have a word. This is a health and safety issue."" But Sheeran's toilet breaks did not appear to dampen the spirits of the 74,000 fans inside Cardiff's Principality Stadium. ""It's our Ed, isn't it?"" said one fan. ""He's real, isn't he?"" Sheeran's concert was part of his Mathematics world tour and it was his first in the UK since 2018. He ended Saturday's set with his hit Perfect while fireworks filled the night sky. ""Absolutely unreal,"" said fan Kirstie Hopkins. ""He was amazing and so so funny with it. ""I'm glad he told us why he had to go - I'd hate to think he'd just left. He's such a down to earth performer."" Sheeran had also been due to play at the Principality Stadium on Friday night but that concert was postponed because of bad weather. He told the crowd: ""I'm sorry again about last night.

Libya civil war: UN envoy Salamé says foreign intervention must end,"On the eve of peace talks in Berlin, Mr Salamé said foreign support of proxy groups in the conflict had created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence. But Mr Haftar, who is based in eastern Libya and is backed by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, rejected the ceasefire. The escalation of foreign involvement in Libya has raised fears that the conflict could become a wider proxy war. The UN has warned that the fighting could lead to a ""catastrophic"" humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced and shortages of food, water and medicine. The Berlin talks are seen as a last-ditch effort to find a political solution to the conflict. But it is unclear whether the warring parties are willing to compromise. Mr Salamé said that he hoped the talks would produce a ""road map"" for a ceasefire and a political settlement. ""We are at a critical moment in Libya's history,"" he said. ""The future of the country is at stake. We cannot afford to fail."" The conflict in Libya began in 2011 with the overthrow of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. Since then, the country has been plagued by violence and political instability. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has struggled to assert its authority over the whole country. The GNA is headquartered in the capital, Tripoli, and is supported by Turkey and Qatar. It is opposed by the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is led by Mr Haftar and is based in eastern Libya. The LNA has made significant gains in recent months, and now controls much of eastern and southern Libya. The GNA has been weakened by defections and internal divisions. The international community has been divided on how to respond to the conflict in Libya. Some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have called for a ceasefire and a political settlement. Others, such as Russia and the United Arab Emirates, have supported Mr Haftar's military campaign. The UN has called for an end to foreign intervention in Libya and for the warring parties to negotiate a political settlement. But it is unclear whether the parties are willing to compromise. The Berlin talks are seen as a last-ditch effort to find a solution to the conflict, but it is unclear whether they will be successful.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sri Lanka met Ban ki Moon panel,"The meeting in New York was not announced to the media by either the UNSG or the Sri Lankan government. ""The panel members took part in a discussion along with an officer named Lynn Pascoe (United States as the Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs) and met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the UN who now holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council,"" the source explained. This source, who wished to remain anonymous, said that during the meeting the panel members expressed their wish to visit Sri Lanka and requested the government's consent to travel to the island. The panel members requested to meet President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, as well as representatives of the opposition parties and civil society groups. The Sri Lankan government has not yet responded to the panel's request to visit the country. However, a government spokesman said that ""the government is committed to cooperating with the UN and will consider the panel's request in due course."" The panel is expected to visit Sri Lanka in the coming months to conduct its investigation. The panel is tasked with investigating allegations of human rights violations and war crimes committed during the final stages of the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war in Sri Lanka ended in May 2009 with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The war was a brutal conflict that claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 people. There have been allegations that both sides in the conflict committed human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and sexual violence. The UN panel is expected to investigate these allegations and report its findings to the UN Secretary-General. The Sri Lankan government has denied the allegations of human rights violations. However, the UN has said that it has received credible reports of such violations. The visit by the UN panel to Sri Lanka is expected to be a significant development in the ongoing debate about human rights violations in the country. The panel's findings could have a major impact on the international community's view of Sri Lanka and could lead to further pressure on the government to address the allegations of human rights violations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Halton Transport: Bus company with huge losses goes into liquidation,"Halton Transport, which runs more than a third of services across the Cheshire borough, lost almost £620,000 in 2019, up from £50,500 in 2017. Halton Borough Council said it had agreed to provide up to £3m to keep the company, which was founded in 1988, operating until the end of the month. But the council and its private sector partners said they were unable to support the business beyond March 29. About 120 jobs are now at risk. The council said it was working with Merseytravel, Transport for Greater Manchester and other bus operators to ensure the majority of Halton Transport services continue to be provided. It added that a review will be carried out of the council's public transport needs in the light of the company's collapse. Halton Transport, which is based in Runcorn, operates 50 buses on 26 routes across Halton, St Helens, Widnes and Warrington. The move represents the latest in a string of bus companies going into administration, following the collapse of several firms including Bordaline, Central Buses and Yourbus. In a statement, Halton Council said: ""Halton Transport has been operating at a financial loss for some time and despite the huge efforts made by staff and management, the company has reached a point where it can no longer continue to trade. ""The council has been working closely with the company and its private sector partners to explore all options to keep the business viable, including a request for more external funding. ""However, following a thorough review of the company's position and its prospects for the future, the council and its partners have reluctantly reached the conclusion that they are unable to support the business beyond March 29."" Council leader Rob Polhill said: ""This is a very difficult day for all the staff, customers and partners of Halton Transport. ""The council has done everything within its power to support the business, but sadly it has not been possible to secure a viable future for the company."" He added: ""The priority now is to ensure the continuation of bus services across Halton. We are working closely with other operators to put in place arrangements to cover as many of Halton Transport's routes as possible.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Will you be lonely this Christmas?,"Will you be lonely this Christmas? Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Nights spent at parties and catching up with friends, culminating with a Christmas surrounded by family. But the festive period is not like that for everyone. Age UK estimates about 450,000 will be spending this Christmas on their own, while others will have minimal contact with loved ones over the festive period. How many people are affected by loneliness? A survey for the charity found 1.4 million older people said they felt lonely some or all of the time. It warned that half of all older people have unmet social needs and more than 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or family member in more than a month. One of the groups most at risk at Christmas is widowers. They may be used to celebrating Christmas with their other half, so being alone can be particularly poignant. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said: ""The holiday season can be a very difficult time for older people. ""We know that loneliness is a huge issue for older people all year round, but Christmas and the winter months can be particularly hard. ""Loneliness can have a very negative impact on people's health and wellbeing. It can increase your risk of developing a wide range of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, depression and dementia. ""It can also make it harder to cope with the challenges of daily life, such as getting out and about or managing your finances. ""That's why it's so important that we all do what we can to help older people feel less lonely. This could involve simply reaching out to an older neighbour or relative, or volunteering with a local charity."" What can be done to help? There are a number of things that can be done to help older people feel less lonely. Reach out to them. Simply calling someone up or popping round for a cup of tea can make a big difference. Listen to them. Sometimes, all people need is someone to talk to. Offer them practical help. This could involve anything from running errands to helping them with their shopping. Encourage them to get involved in activities. This could involve anything from joining a club to volunteering. Be patient and understanding. It may take time for someone to open up about how they're feeling. Christmas can be a lonely time for many people. If you are struggling with loneliness, there are organizations that can help.

Government sets out £1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK government has set out a £1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions by nearly half by 2033. It wants firms to waste less energy, develop low-carbon technologies and invest in equipment that can store captured CO2 under the North Sea. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan was a ""triple win"". It would reduce carbon emissions, cut company costs and create jobs in the UK's industrial heartlands, he said. Industrial sites account for 15% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The announcement is part of the government's strategy to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Next month, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is expected to publish a contract to find and licence a storage site under the North Sea. It will then run a competition to find the best technology to capture and store CO2 from nearby industrial sites. The new funding is likely to be measured against the government's climate commitments in the run-up to crucial UN climate talks this November in Glasgow. At the last major UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, the UK promised to reduce carbon emissions 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. The Climate Change Committee - the UK's independent climate advisory body - has said the UK needs to cut emissions faster in this decade so it can make deeper cuts later. It has called on the government to do more to cut emissions in sectors including industry and transport. The government says the new funding is part of its commitment to decarbonise the whole of the UK economy. It says the money will pay for things such as more efficient equipment, staff training and investment in low-carbon technologies. The Green Alliance think tank said the funding was a good start, but there was far more to do, especially in industries such as steel and chemicals. ""We need a strong policy framework with clear targets and deadlines to ensure that industry decarbonises quickly enough,"" said the group's deputy director Dustin Benton. The head of the Energy Systems Catapult, Pavan Sukhdev, said it was to be applauded for setting out the scale of support required for the transition. ""However, this just covers up to 2025,"" he said. The government must now develop a plan for the next phase of this journey."" Unions welcomed the funding and jobs but said the government must do more to address energy efficiency in homes and businesses. The Prospect union said: ""We believe that the government can make greater use of existing financing tools, such as the Green Homes Grant, with energy efficiency and heat decarbonisation measures as part of the broader national infrastructure plan.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Are we stuck with plastic drinking straws?,"By Louise Greenwood Business reporter John Sidanta, chief executive of Primaplast, said he was aware of rising global concern over levels of plastic pollution. ""We are looking to be ahead of the curve,"" he said, adding that research into alternatives such as paper and biodegradable straws was at an ""exploratory"" stage. ""That's the route we are aiming to go down,"" he added. But environmentalists say that this journey is taking too long. ""Single-use plastic straws are one of the most avoidable plastics,"" said Sam Chetan-Welsh, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK. ""Most people don't need them and it's so easy to find alternatives."" The UK government has pledged to ban all avoidable single-use plastics by 2042. While many restaurants and bars have stopped giving out straws unless they are requested, campaigners say this is not enough. ""The best way forward is a total ban,"" said Ms Chetan-Welsh. ""It's all very well businesses and individuals choosing to reduce their use or replace plastic, but it's really tricky on a large scale and at the end of the day it's up to the government to lead."" However, Mr Sidanta argues that a total ban would only force businesses to import single-use straws from overseas, which could have a greater environmental impact. ""It's not as simple as just banning them,"" he said. ""We need to look at the entire life cycle of a product and make sure that the alternatives are better."" Ultimately, he believes that the key lies in changing consumer behavior. ""People need to challenge their own use of products and make a conscious decision,"" he said. ""It's a combination of government, businesses and individuals working together to reduce plastic consumption."" So, are we stuck with plastic drinking straws? Not necessarily, but it may take a while to find a truly sustainable alternative. In the meantime, campaigners are urging people to refuse straws when they don't need them and to choose reusable alternatives where possible.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Labour MP quits party review group over leadership disagreement,"By Ellie Price BBC News Alison McGovern told the BBC the shadow chancellor had suggested the group she chairs, Progress, co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers. John McDonnell also accused Progress of ""trying to undermine the leadership"". In a statement, McGovern said McDonnell's accusations were ""completely untrue"" and that she was ""proud of the work that Progress has done to represent the views of Labour members and supporters"". She added: ""I have therefore taken the decision to step down as chair of Progress with immediate effect."" McGovern's resignation comes at a time of growing tension within the Labour Party over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Three shadow ministers - Ian Murray, Lucy Powell and Chris Bryant - resigned their positions earlier this week, citing concerns about Corbyn's leadership. McDonnell is a close ally of Corbyn's, and his comments about Progress suggest that he believes the group is part of a wider plot to oust the Labour leader. However, McGovern denied these claims, saying that Progress was ""not a faction"" and that it was ""committed to working for the unity of the Labour Party"". She added: ""I hope that John McDonnell will withdraw his unfounded allegations and work with Progress to build a strong and united Labour Party that can win the next election."" McDonnell has not yet responded to McGovern's resignation. The Labour Party is currently in the midst of a leadership contest, with Corbyn facing a challenge from Owen Smith. The result of the contest is due to be announced on 24 September. If Corbyn loses the contest, it is likely that there will be further resignations from the shadow cabinet. However, if he wins, it is hoped that the party will be able to unite behind him and move forward with a clear strategy for the next election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zhao Ziyang: Purged Chinese Communist reformer is buried,"The remains of Mr Zhao, who died in 2005, were interred along with those of his wife in a quiet ceremony. Mr Zhao was ousted as general secretary of the Communist Party in 1989 after opposing the use of force against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. He was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. Mr Zhao's death was met with widespread mourning in China, with many people seeing him as a symbol of hope and reform. His burial is seen as a sign of the government's willingness to rehabilitate his reputation, which had been tarnished by his association with the Tiananmen Square protests. The ceremony was attended by Mr Zhao's family and friends, as well as a number of senior government officials. The government has not released any details of the ceremony, but it is believed to have been a private affair. Mr Zhao's burial is a significant moment in Chinese history. It is a sign that the government is willing to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and to rehabilitate the reputation of those who have been unjustly persecuted. It is also a sign of the government's confidence in its own stability and its ability to manage dissent. Mr Zhao's death and burial have also sparked a renewed debate about the Tiananmen Square protests. Many people in China believe that the government was wrong to use force against the protesters, and that Mr Zhao was right to oppose it. The government has maintained that the use of force was necessary to restore order, but many people believe that the government's actions were excessive. The Tiananmen Square protests remain a sensitive issue in China, and the government continues to suppress any discussion of them. However, the burial of Mr Zhao is a sign that the government is willing to tolerate a limited amount of dissent. It is also a sign that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests is still alive in China, and that the government cannot completely erase it from history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool,"A third of GP surgeries have been told to contact people who may have been given an inaccurate assessment of their future risk of heart disease. The alert follows the discovery of a problem with a computer algorithm used to calculate risk scores. The tool, called QRISK3, is used by GPs in England to assess the risk of heart disease and stroke in people aged 20 to 84 who are not already receiving treatment. The algorithm takes into account factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family history of heart disease. The problem with the algorithm means that some people have been given an inaccurate risk score, which may have led to them being given the wrong treatment or advice. The NHS has said that it is working to fix the problem and has asked GPs to contact people who may have been affected. The glitch was discovered by researchers at the University of Oxford, who found that the algorithm was underestimating the risk of heart disease in some people, particularly those from South Asian backgrounds. The researchers said that the glitch could have affected up to 3 million people in England. The NHS has said that the glitch is being fixed and that people who have been affected will be contacted by their GP. In the meantime, people who are concerned about their risk of heart disease should speak to their GP. Dr Charmaine Griffiths, NHS England's national clinical director for heart disease, said: ""We are working to fix the problem with the QRISK3 algorithm as quickly as possible. ""We have asked GP surgeries to contact people who may have been affected and to offer them a further assessment of their risk of heart disease.

Arizona wildfire: Battling the blaze,"The interagency ""hotshot"" team - of which there are a number across the US - are highly trained and equipped to work in remote locations, tackling the most challenging wildfires. They are often the first responders in the most dangerous areas, where terrain and fire conditions are most extreme. With the Tunnel fire in northern Arizona threatening the remote community of Munds Park, one team of 20 hotshots from New Mexico was deployed to help bring the fire under control. They were joined by a second 20-member team from Arizona. On 20 April, the hotshots were airlifted into a clearing close to the fire and spent the day hiking through thick vegetation, digging fire lines and removing flammable material. The aim was to starve the blaze of fuel and stop it from spreading towards the community and popular tourist destination of Flagstaff. As well as battling the fire on the ground, aircraft were also deployed to drop retardant and water on the flames. Helicopters filled their tanks from a nearby lake, flying low over the fire to dump their loads with pinpoint accuracy. Working alongside the hotshots on the ground were bulldozers and other heavy machinery, clearing vegetation to create fire breaks and widening existing roads to allow fire engines to reach the blaze. As night fell, the hotshots camped out at their remote base, ready to resume their work at daybreak. Weather conditions were mostly favourable, with light winds and no rain, but the fire was continuing to burn and they knew there was still a long way to go. The following day, the hotshots continued to dig fire lines and remove vegetation, working in shifts to ensure there was always a fresh team ready to take over. The fire had spread to around 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) but firefighters were slowly managing to bring it under control, with containment lines established around 20% of its perimeter. As the sun set on the second day of the operation, the hotshots were finally able to return to their base camp, exhausted but satisfied that they were making progress in containing the blaze. They knew there was still much work to be done, but they were confident that they would eventually succeed in bringing the fire under control.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Deadly earthquake rocks India, Nepal and Tibet","The epicentre of the earthquake was in India's mountainous Sikkim state, where at least 18 people were killed. Rain and landslides are hindering search and rescue operations there and officials in the state say more deaths are likely. The earthquake shook the Sikkim state, which borders Nepal and Tibet, at around midday local time. It measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and was felt across the region, including in the Indian capital, New Delhi. In Nepal, at least 12 people were killed and dozens injured. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse in the capital, Kathmandu, and there are fears that the death toll could rise as rescue workers reach remote areas. In Tibet, at least one person was killed and several others injured. The earthquake caused damage to buildings and infrastructure in the region, and there are fears that the death toll could rise as rescue workers reach remote areas. The earthquake has caused widespread damage across the region, and relief workers are struggling to reach remote areas. The Indian government has deployed disaster response teams to Sikkim and Nepal, and international aid agencies are also sending assistance. The earthquake is a reminder of the seismic risks facing the region. The Himalayas are a seismically active area, and there have been several major earthquakes in the region in recent years. In 2015, a major earthquake struck Nepal, killing more than 8,000 people. In 2019, a major earthquake struck Sikkim, killing more than 100 people. Scientists say that the region is at risk of further major earthquakes, and they are urging governments and communities to prepare for such events.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study,"Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study Air pollution contributes to 40,000 early deaths each year in the UK and we gulp in more of it when we exercise. On the other hand, regular exercise reduces the risk of diabetes, heart and lung disease, and early death. So what are the risks and benefits of cycling and walking in polluted cities? A new study published in the journal Environment International has found that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution, even in cities with high levels of pollution. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study, which included over 500,000 adults. They looked at the participants' levels of physical activity, air pollution exposure, and health outcomes. They found that people who cycled or walked regularly had a lower risk of death from all causes, including death from heart disease, stroke, cancer, and respiratory disease. The researchers also found that the benefits of cycling and walking were greater than the risks from air pollution, even in cities with high levels of pollution. In fact, the benefits were greatest in cities with the highest levels of pollution. The study provides strong evidence that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution. This is important news, as it means that people can still enjoy the benefits of exercise, even in polluted cities. However, the study also found that air pollution can have a negative impact on lung function. The researchers found that people who were exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower lung function than people who were exposed to low levels of air pollution. This suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development of respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. The study's findings are consistent with other research that has found that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution. However, the study's findings are particularly important because they are based on a large sample size and because they looked at the effects of air pollution on a wide range of health outcomes. The study's findings have important implications for public health policy. The findings suggest that policymakers should encourage people to cycle and walk more, even in polluted cities. The findings also suggest that policymakers should take steps to reduce air pollution levels in cities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nora Ephron remembered at star-packed memorial,"Ephron, whose hit films include When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, died last month aged 71. 800 friends and family were invited to the Lincoln Center, including heavyweights from the worlds of film, television, music and politics.

""Her writing had that rare ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time,"" said Streep, who starred in many of Ephron's films. Another close friend, Meg Ryan, said: ""She taught me more about life, men and shoes than any other woman alive."" Ryan, who starred in Ephron's romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle, recalled how the writer had once told her: ""Life is never what you expect and people will disappoint you over and over again, but pancakes never disappoint."" Ephron's wit and wisdom was also remembered by her son, Max Handelman, who said: ""My mother taught me that you should always get your heartbroken because it makes you a better writer."" He added: ""She also taught me that you should always wear sunscreen and never trust a man who doesn't like dogs."" Other speakers at the memorial included Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Diane Keaton and Oprah Winfrey. Spielberg said Ephron was ""one of the most brilliant and original voices of our time."" ""Her films were not just about love and relationships, they were about the human condition,"" he said. Hanks, who starred in Ephron's romantic comedy You've Got Mail, said: ""Nora was a master at capturing the complexities of human relationships."" ""She could make you laugh and cry in the same breath,"" he said. Keaton, who starred in Ephron's comedy-drama Hanging Up, said: ""Nora was a true friend and a brilliant writer."" ""She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,"" she said. Winfrey, who was a close friend of Ephron's, said: ""Nora was a one-of-a-kind talent."" ""She was a brilliant writer, a gifted director and a wonderful friend,"" she said. ""She will be remembered for her wit, her wisdom and her love of life.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"European elections 2019: Remainers are angry too, says Vince Cable","The Lib Dem leader told the BBC that young people felt their future had been ""taken away from them by a generation that were born in the war"" through Brexit. ""They're the ones that will suffer in the long term. Their wages won't go up, their life chances won't be as good,"" he said. Cable also said that former Labour voters were angry at the party for not giving them a second referendum. ""They feel betrayed by Labour,"" he said. ""They feel that Labour has abandoned them."" The Lib Dems are targeting Remain-voting Labour supporters in seats across the country. The party is hoping to win back some of the seats it lost to Labour in the 2017 general election. The European elections are taking place on 23 May. The Lib Dems are hoping to do well in the elections, and they are hoping to use the results to push for a second referendum on Brexit. The European elections are the first nationwide poll since the 2017 general election. The results of the elections will be seen as a test of public opinion on Brexit. The Lib Dems are not the only party targeting Remain-voting Labour supporters. The Green Party is also hoping to win over these voters. The Greens are hoping to build on their success in the local elections in May, when they won control of Brighton and Hove City Council. The European elections are likely to be closely fought. The Lib Dems, the Greens, and the Brexit Party are all hoping to do well in the elections. The results of the elections could have a significant impact on the future of Brexit. If the Lib Dems and the Greens do well in the elections, it could increase pressure on the government to hold a second referendum. However, if the Brexit Party does well, it could strengthen the government's position and make it less likely that there will be a second referendum. The European elections are an important opportunity for voters to have their say on Brexit. The results of the elections will be closely watched by politicians and commentators alike.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tony Nicklinson's 'courage' will lead to law change,"Mr Nicklinson, a man with locked-in syndrome who fought to legally end his life, died on Wednesday. Lord Joffe, a right-to-die campaigner, said the law needs to be changed and ""MPs should reflect the views of the nation"". Nicklinson was diagnosed with the condition in 2005 after suffering a stroke. He was unable to move or speak, and communicated through a computer using eye-tracking technology. In 2012, he launched a legal challenge against the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), arguing that the ban on assisted suicide was a breach of his human rights. The High Court ruled against him, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision in 2014. However, the Supreme Court ruled against Nicklinson in 2015. Lord Joffe said Nicklinson's ""courage"" would lead to a change in the law. ""The public is overwhelmingly in favor of a change in the law,"" he said. ""MPs should reflect the views of the nation."" A YouGov poll in 2015 found that 82% of Britons support a change in the law on assisted suicide. The government has said it will not change the law, but it is under pressure from campaigners to do so. In 2019, the House of Commons voted in favor of a bill that would have legalized assisted suicide for terminally ill adults. However, the bill was defeated in the House of Lords. Nicklinson's death is likely to reignite the debate about assisted suicide. His courage in fighting for his right to die has inspired many people, and his legacy is likely to be a change in the law. In addition to Lord Joffe's comments, other prominent figures have also called for a change in the law. Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: ""Tony Nicklinson's death is a reminder of the urgent need to change the law on assisted dying. ""The current law is cruel and unjust, and it denies people the right to a peaceful and dignified death. ""We urge the government to listen to the public and to introduce legislation that would allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives with medical assistance.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Golden hello' offered to some new GPs in Scotland,"One hundred new GP training places are being advertised, with a £20,000 incentive for some who choose to take up hard to fill posts. Some medical bodies are concerned Scotland is becoming increasingly reliant on overseas doctors, to fill the growing number of vacancies. In some areas in Scotland, almost a third of GPs are from overseas. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the new incentives would help make general practice a more attractive career option and boost recruitment and retention. The new £20,000 ""golden hello"" is being offered to doctors who sign up to work in areas experiencing a shortage of GPs. The funding for the new package has come from the Scottish government's £500m NHS recovery plan. The new GP recruitment drive was launched at Scone Palace in Perth on Thursday. It aims to make general practice a ""more attractive career option"" and boost recruitment and retention. Mr Yousaf said: ""These 100 new GP training places and £20,000 'golden hellos' will help to make general practice a more attractive career option and boost recruitment and retention. ""We know that general practice is the cornerstone of our NHS and these new measures will help to ensure that people across Scotland continue to have access to high quality healthcare, delivered in their communities."" The new GP training places will be available from August 2023. The £20,000 ""golden hello"" will be paid in two instalments - £10,000 after the first year of training and £10,000 after the second year. The total cost of the package is £2m. The Scottish government said it is committed to increasing the number of GPs in Scotland to 5,000 by 2027. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) welcomed the new measures but said more needs to be done to address the underlying problems facing general practice. RCGP Scotland chair Dr Miles Mack said: ""The £20,000 'golden hello' is a welcome step in the right direction, but it is only one part of the solution. We need to see long-term investment in general practice and a commitment to reducing the workload of GPs. Otherwise, we will continue to see GPs leaving the profession and the number of vacancies increasing."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also welcomed the new measures but said they must be part of a wider strategy to address the workforce crisis in the NHS. BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison said: ""The new GP training places and £20,000 'golden hellos' are a positive step, but they must be part of a wider strategy to address the workforce crisis in the NHS. We need to see long-term investment in training and recruitment, and we need to make sure that GPs are supported to deliver high quality care to their patients.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"House prices see biggest monthly fall since 2010, Halifax says","The lender said prices fell by 3.1% between March and April, the biggest decline since September 2010. The bank said that housing demand had softened in the early months of this year, as the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates started to put off potential buyers. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: ""The housing market has started the year with a significant monthly price fall, the first since June 2021 and the largest since the depths of the initial Covid lockdown in 2020. ""While there are signs that buyer demand is moderating, there is still a chronic shortage of available stock on the market. This is likely to continue supporting house prices in the short-term, although the headwinds are growing."" The average house price in the UK is now £278,123, which is £8,691 lower than in March. The annual rate of house price growth has also slowed, from 11.5% in March to 8.4% in April. This is the lowest annual rate of growth since June 2021. The slowdown in house price growth is likely to continue in the coming months, as the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates put off potential buyers. Some experts have predicted that house prices could fall by as much as 10% over the next year. However, others believe that the fall in prices will be more modest, as the lack of supply of homes for sale will continue to support the market. The housing market is a complex one, and there are a number of factors that can affect house prices. These include the economy, interest rates, government policy, and the availability of housing. It is difficult to predict what will happen to house prices in the future, but it is likely that the market will continue to be volatile in the short-term.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scottish women return after stem cell transplants in Russia,"By David Cowan BBC Scotland Jill McLaren and Michele Murray have been living with multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years. They travelled to Moscow for stem cell transplants after initial treatment failed to ease their symptoms. The trips have left both women feeling much better, although it is too early to tell if the stem cells have reversed any of the damage to their immune systems. MS is a neurological condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, difficulty with movement, and problems with vision and speech. There is no cure for MS, but treatments can help to manage the symptoms. In some cases, stem cell transplants can be used to repair the damage to the immune system that causes MS. Jill, 46, from Perth, was diagnosed with MS in 2002. She began experiencing symptoms in 1999, including fatigue, blurred vision, and numbness in her hands and feet. Over the years, her symptoms worsened, and she began to experience problems with her mobility. She was eventually forced to give up her job as a nurse. In 2017, Jill heard about a stem cell transplant clinic in Moscow that was offering treatment for MS. She decided to travel to Russia for the procedure. The transplant involved harvesting stem cells from Jill's own blood and then re-infusing them into her body. The stem cells were then able to travel to the damaged areas of her immune system and repair them. Jill underwent the transplant in 2018, and she has noticed a significant improvement in her symptoms since then. She is now able to walk and move more easily, and she has less pain and fatigue. Michele, 50, from Dundee, was diagnosed with MS in 2003. She began experiencing symptoms in 2000, including fatigue, loss of balance, and problems with her speech. Over the years, her symptoms worsened, and she eventually had to give up her job as a social worker. In 2019, Michele travelled to Moscow for a stem cell transplant. She has also noticed a significant improvement in her symptoms since then. She is now able to walk and move more easily, and she has less pain and fatigue. Both Jill and Michele are hopeful that the stem cell transplants will continue to improve their symptoms and that they will eventually be able to live full and active lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Gunman's parents 'raced to stop him',"They raced to Isla Vista but heard radio reports on the shootings as they drove, friend Simon Astaire told US media. Elliot Rodger, 22, warned of his intentions in his emailed manifesto and a YouTube video posted the day before. Arriving in town, they found streets cordoned off and police on every corner. ""We didn't know where he was or what state he might be in,"" Peter Rodger said. ""We were desperately phoning him, texting him - trying to help him work through it."" Reports suggest he then went on a spree, killing six people and injuring 13. He was finally cornered by police outside an apartment block and shot dead during a car chase. Hours before the attack, Elliot Rodger sent an email to friends and relatives containing a 141-page ""manifesto"" and a link to a video uploaded on YouTube. The document was full of misogynistic rants and detailed plans to murder women and others he saw as enemies. The video showed the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) psychology major sitting in his car, driving around Isla Vista. ""I will punish all of you for it,"" he said in the video, describing how he planned to ""slaughter"" sorority girls and other women who had rejected him. ""I'm angry at all of you,"" he added. ""You have never accepted me, and you have taken away my purpose in life."" In the manifesto, Rodger said he had been planning the attack for the past two years and had acquired three handguns legally. He also detailed how he had been rejected by women and was angry at being treated as an ""inferior"" because he was Asian. ""I have been laughed at, mocked, humiliated, and scorned,"" he wrote. ""I have been treated like a subhuman by the beautiful popular girls that I have desired all my life."" Rodger's classmates described him as a quiet, loner who was often seen around campus. One student, David Wang, told CNN that Rodger had been a member of the school's tennis team but had been kicked off after making threats to the coach. Another student, Eric Chen, said Rodger had been ""kind of weird"" but had never seemed violent. ""He was just a quiet guy,"" Chen said.

The psychological secrets to successful resolutions,"Unfortunately, quite a few fail. But there are some psychological tactics which can be employed to increase the chances of success. 1. Persistence Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, author of 59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot, says: ""Successful people are persistent. They don't give up if they don't see results immediately."" So, if you don't achieve your goal straight away, don't despair. Just keep at it and you'll eventually get there. 2. Small steps Don't try to do too much at once. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will make it seem less daunting and more achievable. ""If your goal is to lose weight, don't try to lose 20kg in a month,"" says Wiseman. ""Start with a more realistic goal, like losing 2kg in a month. Once you've achieved that, you can set a new goal."" 3. Positive self-talk The way you talk to yourself can have a big impact on your success. If you keep telling yourself that you can't do something, you're more likely to give up. Instead, try to be positive and encouraging. Tell yourself that you can do it, and that you're going to achieve your goal. ""Self-talk can be a powerful tool for motivation,"" says Wiseman. ""Positive self-talk can help you to stay focused and determined, even when things get tough."" 4. Accountability Tell someone else about your goal. This could be a friend, family member, or colleague. Having someone to hold you accountable can help you to stay on track. ""When you're accountable to someone else, you're more likely to follow through on your commitment,"" says Wiseman. 5. Reward yourself When you achieve a milestone, reward yourself. This will help you to stay motivated and make the process more enjoyable. ""Rewards can be anything that you enjoy, such as buying yourself something nice, going out for a meal, or spending time with friends,"" says Wiseman. ""Just make sure that the reward is something that you'll really enjoy, so that you're motivated to work towards it."" By following these psychological tactics, you can increase your chances of success and achieve your goals. So what are you waiting for? Get started today!",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid:19: Robin Swann hopes for memorial in NI,"Mr Swann said the situation was ""better than expected"" at the start of the pandemic but that ""nobody could have comprehended the suffering that lay ahead"". ""A year on from when this awful virus reached our shores, my thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one or who continues to battle the effects of long Covid,"" he said. ""Having a memorial would provide a permanent space to remember the lives that have been lost to this virus and would also provide a place of reflection for those left behind."" Stormont's health committee chair Colm Gildernew said he would support the idea of a memorial. ""The Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on our communities, taking lives and leaving many others with life-changing long Covid symptoms,"" he said. ""It is important that we have a permanent memorial to remember those who have lost their lives and to honour the sacrifices that have been made by our health and social care workers."" Last week, the UK government announced plans for a national memorial for Covid victims, with a consultation due to be launched. The Northern Ireland government said it would work with the UK government on its plans. In other developments: The number of people in Northern Ireland who have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine has passed 800,000.

"Somerset badger cull fails to meet target, Defra admits","The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone – 1,177 badgers, according to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But it failed to meet its target of at least a 70% reduction. Between 2013 and 2017, government-led badger culls took place across four areas of England with the aim of reducing the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Since the culling licenses were last renewed in 2018, the cull areas have been reduced and the Gloucestershire cull zone was closed in 2021. Two cull zones remain in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire, despite ongoing legal challenges and opposition from animal welfare groups. Defra said it was ""disappointed"" the target was not met, but said the 65% reduction did represent ""good progress"". The department said: ""Badger numbers are estimated to be significantly higher than in 2013, so although the 70% cull target was not achieved, the number of badgers removed in the last five years represents a substantial reduction in the badger population in both cull areas."" The Badger Trust, which has long campaigned against the cull, said the results showed it was ""inhumane, ineffective and unscientific"". Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: ""After five years and six weeks of badger killing, Defra has failed even to achieve its own arbitrary cull target. ""Defra have blamed 'bad weather' for the fact they killed fewer badgers than they set out to do. What a pathetic excuse. If cold and wet weather can scupper a multi-million-pound cull of badgers, what a terrible indictment of the operation."" The RSPCA also condemned the cull, saying it was ""cruel and unnecessary"". David Bowles, the RSPCA's head of public affairs, said: ""We continue to believe that the badger cull is a cruel and unnecessary way of managing the spread of TB in cattle. ""There is no scientific evidence to prove that badger culling is effective in reducing TB in cattle, and there are more humane and effective ways of controlling the disease."" The government has said it will review the results of the cull before making a decision on whether to continue with it. A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are considering the results of the badger cull and will make a decision on future policy in due course.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
David Cameron backs Maria Miller as expenses inquiry launched,"The prime minister said his culture secretary had ""excellent answers"" to questions about her expenses claims. Labour MP John Mann submitted a complaint about her claims on Tuesday. It follows reports she had allowed a taxpayer-funded nanny to work on her party political activities. Downing Street said Cameron remained ""fully supportive"" of Miller (pictured) after receiving a letter from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) on Wednesday. Ipsa has launched an inquiry into Miller's expenses and requested documents from her office. The complaint centre on the employment of a full-time nanny. The BBC understands the nanny cared for Miller's young child while her husband was living at the family home. Miller's expenses claims have caused controversy since they were first reported by the Daily Telegraph in 2012. The newspaper alleged Miller claimed for mortgage interest payments on a buy-to-let property she owned despite not living in it. Miller was accused of abusing the ""second homes"" allowance, which was intended to help MPs with the cost of maintaining a second home in London. The MP for Basingstoke claimed £90,000 over a five-year period through the arrangement. In 2013, the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ordered Miller to repay £45,000 of the £90,000 she had claimed. A spokesman for Miller said she had ""always followed the rules and acted in the best interests of taxpayers"". The spokesman added: ""She welcomes the Ipsa inquiry and will co-operate fully."" The inquiry is likely to take several months. The report will conclude whether Miller broke the rules and, if so, what sanction she should face. The expenses scandal has damaged public trust in politicians. It has also led to the creation of new rules governing MPs' expenses. The Ipsa inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into MPs' expenses. In 2010, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up to oversee MPs' expenses. Ipsa has since introduced new rules governing MPs' expenses. The new rules are designed to make the system more transparent and accountable.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Kincora should be part of UK inquiry into child abuse says Amnesty,"The announcement of a new inquiry into the governmental handling of historic child abuse claims brings the issue of Kincora boys' home back into the spotlight. Amnesty International has called for the notorious institution to be included in the probe, citing concerns that it formed part of a wider pattern of abuse that was allegedly covered up by authorities. The Kincora scandal erupted in the 1980s when it was revealed that boys at the Belfast home had been subjected to horrific sexual abuse by staff members. The case sent shockwaves through Northern Ireland and beyond, leading to the resignation of several government ministers and the establishment of a public inquiry. However, Amnesty International has raised concerns that the public inquiry, known as the Historic Abuse Inquiry, did not fully examine the systemic failures that allowed the abuse to take place. The group is particularly interested in exploring the potential links between Kincora and other institutions where child abuse was allegedly covered up. ""There are serious concerns that Kincora was not an isolated case, but part of a wider pattern of abuse that was facilitated by a culture of secrecy and impunity,"" said Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland programme director. ""This new inquiry must leave no stone unturned in examining the full extent of these allegations."" The Home Secretary's announcement of a new inquiry has been welcomed by victims' groups and campaigners. However, there are concerns that the inquiry may be too narrow in scope. The terms of reference for the inquiry are yet to be published, but it is understood that it will focus on how the government handled allegations of child abuse within its own institutions. Amnesty International is calling for the inquiry to be expanded to include wider institutional failures, such as those that occurred at Kincora. The group also wants the inquiry to examine the role of the security services in the alleged cover-up of child abuse. ""It is essential that this inquiry is independent, thorough, and transparent,"" said Corrigan. ""The victims of child abuse deserve nothing less."" The Kincora scandal is a dark chapter in Northern Ireland's history. The new inquiry provides an opportunity to shine a light on the full extent of the abuse that took place and to ensure that those responsible are held to account.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scrap metal laws to be tightened to tackle theft,"Home Secretary Theresa May announced the proposed new laws in a written statement to MPs. The measures will end the current ""low-risk transactions"" for scrap metal dealers, as they will now be required to get a licence to trade. They will also have to carry out checks on customers' identities and record details of all transactions. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to £5,000 or a prison sentence of up to two years. The new laws are part of a wider crackdown on metal theft, which has seen a sharp increase in recent years. In 2013, there were an estimated 56,000 incidents of metal theft in England and Wales, with a total value of £77m. Much of the stolen metal is sold to scrap dealers, who often pay cash and ask no questions about where it came from. The new laws are designed to make it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen metal, and to encourage scrap dealers to be more vigilant about the sources of the metal they purchase. They will also make it easier for the police to track down stolen metal and prosecute those responsible for its theft. The new laws have been welcomed by the scrap metal industry, which has long argued for tougher action to tackle metal theft. The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) said that the new laws ""will help to create a level playing field for all scrap metal dealers and will make it more difficult for criminals to operate."" However, some concerns have been raised about the impact of the new laws on legitimate scrap metal dealers. The BMRA has warned that the new regulations could increase the cost of doing business for scrap metal dealers, and could lead to some legitimate businesses closing down. The government has said that it will work with the scrap metal industry to ensure that the new laws do not have a negative impact on legitimate businesses. It has also said that it will provide funding to help scrap metal dealers comply with the new regulations. The new laws are due to come into force in 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

It sold 2.72 million units globally in the nine months to 31 December, short of its target of three million. In a statement, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said: ""As sales of the Wii U have fallen short of our expectations, our overall financial results have also fallen short."" He added: ""We are currently working to increase the sales of our Wii U hardware and software as soon as possible."" Nintendo has already cut the price of the Wii U twice since its launch and has also announced plans to release a range of new games for the console. However, analysts have said that it will be difficult for Nintendo to turn around the fortunes of the Wii U, which has been outsold by rival consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Wii U is Nintendo's first console to use a tablet-style controller. It has been praised for its innovative design, but has struggled to attract a wide audience. Some analysts believe that Nintendo has failed to market the console effectively, while others have said that the Wii U's games library is too small. Despite the Wii U's disappointing sales, Nintendo remains one of the most successful video game companies in the world. Its other products, such as the Nintendo 3DS handheld console and the Wii, have been huge hits. Nintendo's financial results will be a blow to the company and its investors. However, it is still too early to say whether the Wii U will be a commercial failure. Nintendo has a history of bouncing back from setbacks, and it will be hoping that it can do the same with the Wii U.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sabarimala temple: Indian women form '620km human chain' for equality,"The Sabarimala shrine was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. India's top court overturned the ban in September, but conservative groups have protested the decision. As a mark of resistance, hundreds of women participated in a 620km human chain on January 1, 2019. The chain extended from the northern city of Kasaragod to the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, passing through several towns and villages. Women of all ages and backgrounds joined the chain, which was organised by the Kerala Women's Wall collective. Many of the women carried placards demanding equality and respect for women. The event was largely peaceful, but there were some reports of violence. In one incident, a group of men attacked a woman who was participating in the chain. Despite the challenges, the women's wall was seen as a major success. It sent a strong message of unity and solidarity, and it demonstrated the growing demand for gender equality in India. The Sabarimala temple issue has been a flashpoint for debate about gender equality in India. Conservative groups have argued that the ban on women is necessary to protect the ""purity"" of the temple. However, many women's rights activists have condemned the ban as discriminatory and unjust. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the ban was a significant victory for women's rights in India. However, the ongoing protests by conservative groups show that the fight for gender equality is far from over. In the wake of the women's wall, the Kerala government has announced that it will provide security for women who want to visit the Sabarimala temple. The government has also said that it will not tolerate any violence against women who are trying to enter the temple. These are positive steps, but it is important to remember that the fight for gender equality in India is an ongoing one. There are still many laws and practices that discriminate against women in India. The women's wall was a powerful symbol of resistance against these discriminatory practices. It showed that women in India are increasingly determined to fight for their rights.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dumfries and Galloway Council made £6.9m waste deal payment,"The figure emerged after a BBC Freedom of Information request about the financial impact of ending the contract on the Dumfries and Galloway authority. Company accounts of Shanks show that in the year to the end of March 2018, it billed the council £2.6m for the disposal of municipal waste and £2m for landfill tax - a total of £4.6m. In addition, the council paid the firm £1m in ""early termination payments"" after the two-year contract ended in May 2018 and a further £1.3m in ""residual waste treatment costs"" over the next six months. The £6.9m package paid to Shanks led to opposition councillors claiming the authority was ""paying over the odds"" to terminate the contract. And it has also emerged that when the council ended the contract it was still contractually obliged to pay Shanks the £2m annual landfill tax until 2023. The authority secured a loan from the Scottish Government in order to settle the £6.9m bill, which will be paid back over a number of years. A spokesman for the council said: ""The early termination payment was to cover the costs that Shanks had incurred in setting up the contract, and the residual waste treatment costs represented the cost of having waste treated at other facilities."" He added that the council had ""no option"" but to end the waste contract as it was ""not sustainable"". ""The council is now working with other local authorities to explore options for waste disposal in the region,"" he said. Shanks declined to comment. The council's waste bill has been the subject of much debate and scrutiny in recent years. In 2017, it emerged that the authority had paid out £1.4m in compensation to Shanks after a dispute over the quality of recycled materials. And last year, it was revealed that the council was paying £3.7m a year to store waste on a site near Gretna. The Scottish Conservatives have accused the Scottish Government of ""failing"" the people of Dumfries and Galloway by allowing waste costs to spiral out of control.

'Slow progress' on child abuse claims in Pembrokeshire,"A follow-up report says improvements have been made in child safeguarding. But management of allegations against Pembrokeshire council professionals remains ""inconsistent"". The council is one of 20 in the UK subject to extra scrutiny over how they handle child abuse claims. Inspectors found ""significant and sustained"" improvements have been made since a previous visit in 2019. But, they said: ""Progress in progressing and resolving individual allegations remains slow."" Inspectors said this was partly caused by the council's managers having ""inconsistent"" approaches to dealing with complaints. However, they praised the council's staff for their ""strong commitment"" to protecting children. Inspectors found a ""significant increase"" in the number of child protection cases investigated by the council's social workers. There were 803 investigations in the year to March 2022, compared with 486 in 2018-19. The number of cases where children were subject to a child protection plan has also increased, from 173 in 2018-19 to 203 in 2021-22. Inspectors welcomed the increase, saying it showed the council was taking a ""more proactive approach"" to child protection. However, they said the council needed to improve the quality of its assessments and plans. Inspectors said the council had made ""significant progress"" in improving its record-keeping. However, they said the council still needed to do more to ensure all records were kept up to date and easily accessible. Overall, inspectors said the council was making ""progress"" in improving its child protection services. However, they said there was still room for improvement, particularly in relation to the management of allegations against council professionals. A Pembrokeshire Council spokesperson said: ""We welcome the recognition of the significant progress that our social care workforce has made in safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and their families. ""We are committed to providing a comprehensive and robust child protection service that places children at the heart of everything we do.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Luton Borough Council proposes cuts to plug £22m shortfall,"Luton Borough Council said its income from Luton Airport ""has all but dried up"". It faced a £50m shortfall and needed to save nearly £22m. Without ""adequate emergency funding"" the authority ""will be forced to implement extreme savings"", it said. The airport, which is owned by the council and operated by London Luton Airport Operations, has been closed since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The council said it was working with the airport to ""explore options"", but warned that ""significant redundancies"" could be necessary. The council's leader, Kevin Chapman, said: ""The impact of the pandemic on Luton Airport has been catastrophic. We are facing a £50m shortfall in our income and we have to save nearly £22m. ""We have been working with the airport to explore options, but we are now at the point where we have to consider implementing extreme savings. ""This could include significant redundancies, which would be a devastating blow to our staff and the local economy."" The council is also facing a £20m shortfall in its council tax collection. Chapman said: ""We are doing everything we can to support our residents and businesses during this difficult time, but we need the government to provide us with adequate emergency funding. ""Without this funding, we will be forced to implement extreme savings, which will have a devastating impact on our services and the lives of our residents."" The government has provided local authorities with £3.2bn to help them cope with the financial impact of the pandemic, but Luton Borough Council says this is not enough. Chapman said: ""The government needs to do more to help local authorities.

Ken Watson, managing director of Sydney Seaplanes, the company that operated the flight, said the turn was ""inexplicable"". ""We don't know why the pilot made such a sharp turn at low altitude,"" he told the BBC. ""It's something that we're trying to understand."" The aircraft was carrying seven people - the pilot and six passengers, including five members of a British family who were on holiday in Australia. The passengers have been named as Richard Cousins, his wife Emma, their two children, William and Isabella, and Emma's sister, Heather. The pilot has been named as Gareth Morgan. The Cousins family were from Hampshire, in southern England. Richard Cousins was the former chief executive of the catering company Compass Group. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the crash. A final report is expected to be released in the coming months. In the meantime, Sydney Seaplanes has suspended all flights. The company has also offered its condolences to the victims' families. ""Our thoughts are with the families of the victims,"" said Mr Watson. ""We are doing everything we can to support them during this difficult time."" The crash has raised questions about the safety of seaplanes.

Demi Lovato fans organise 'get well soon' singalong,"But rather than getting angry, the fans who'd arrived at the venue got together to send a message to the singer, who'd taken ill earlier in the day. Gathering at the O2's Blueroom Cafe, they began singing a rendition of Lovato's song Warrior. Videos on social media show dozens of fans standing arm-in-arm, arms aloft, singing the lyrics directly into their camera phones. ""Now I'm a warrior/Now I got thicker skin/I'm a warrior/I'm stronger than I've ever been,"" they sang. The song has long been a favourite among Lovato's fans, who identify with its message of overcoming adversity. Lovato herself tweeted that she was ""blown away"" by the fan support. ""I am so grateful for all of your love and support,"" she wrote. ""Thank you for making me feel so loved."" The singalong wasn't the only way Lovato's fans showed their support. Many took to social media to share messages of love and encouragement. One fan wrote: ""Demi, you are a warrior and you will get through this. We are all here for you."" Another wrote: ""Demi, your music has helped me through so much. Thank you for sharing your story with the world."" Lovato's illness is the latest in a series of health struggles she has faced in recent years. In 2018, she was hospitalised for an apparent drug overdose. She has since spoken openly about her struggles with addiction and mental health. Lovato's fans are hoping that this latest setback will not derail her progress.

Coastguard rescues suspected migrants off Kent coast,"The BBC has been told some of the passengers phoned relatives in Calais to say they were in trouble after their boat started taking in water. HM Coastguard said it started receiving multiple 999 calls at about 18:30 BST on Thursday. Two RNLI lifeboats, Dover lifeboat and two French patrol vessels were sent to the scene. One person was airlifted to hospital but their condition is not yet known. The remaining 30 on board the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) were described as ""cold and wet"" when they were brought back to Dover. Dover RNLI coxswain Mark Jackson said: ""It was a very rough night with a large swell and Force 6 winds so the sea conditions were challenging for both the passengers and the rescue teams. ""It's believed the vessel had been at sea for some considerable time before we reached it. ""All of the people were quickly moved to the shelter of the lifeboat and given blankets and hot drinks to warm them up."" French officials say they are stepping up efforts to tackle Channel crossings, which they blame on organised crime gangs. The government has been criticised by opposition politicians for its handling of the numbers of migrants arriving in the UK from France. More than 4,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year, a figure that is already higher than the total for the whole of last year. In April, the government announced a plan to send migrants who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda. The policy has been condemned by refugee charities and human rights groups, and is currently being challenged in the courts.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Warning of challenges for UK oil sector from Wood Group,"Bob Keiller warned that the second half of the North Sea story is going to be different from the first. He was speaking ahead of the Offshore Europe exhibition and conference in Aberdeen. Mr Keiller said the industry was at a ""critical juncture"" as the world transitioned to net zero and countries looked to reduce their reliance on hydrocarbons. ""We're going to have to find ways to do things which we haven't done before,"" he said. ""We're going to have to work more collaboratively, more efficiently, and we're going to have to be more innovative."" Mr Keiller said the industry needed to focus on three key areas: Improving recovery rates: The UK currently recovers around 40% of the oil and gas from its North Sea fields. Mr Keiller said this could be increased to 50% or even 60% by using new technologies. Developing new technologies: The industry needs to invest in new technologies that can help to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This includes technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation. Collaboration: The industry needs to work more closely together to share ideas and expertise. This includes working with companies in other sectors, such as the renewable energy sector. Mr Keiller said the industry needed to ""change the narrative"" around the North Sea. ""We need to show that the North Sea is still a vital part of the UK's energy mix,"" he said. ""And we need to show that the industry is committed to investing in the future."" The Offshore Europe exhibition and conference is one of the world's leading events for the offshore energy industry. It takes place in Aberdeen every two years and attracts over 35,000 visitors. The event is a showcase for the latest technologies and innovations in the offshore energy sector. It also provides a platform for industry leaders to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry.

The government has said that academies are more autonomous than council-run schools and are therefore able to ""innovate and improve more quickly."" However, critics have argued that academies can be less accountable to parents and the local community. The letter from Michael Gove comes after the council rejected a proposal to turn Bexhill High School into an academy. The school is currently run by the council.

The consequences of a busy day,"Nick Triggle Health correspondent The day before Liverpool had won the Carling Cup football final, while the Sun on Sunday had just been launched. For the NHS, it was just another manic Monday. The emergency department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital was packed. It was the busiest day of the year so far, with more than 400 patients passing through its doors. Dr Rebecca Jones, the department's clinical director, said it was a ""perfect storm"" of factors that had led to the surge in demand. ""We had a lot of people coming in with injuries from the football match, as well as people who had been drinking too much and had fallen over,"" she said. ""We also had a lot of patients with respiratory problems, which is common at this time of year. It all added up to a very busy day."" The Royal Liverpool Hospital is not alone. Emergency departments across the country are reporting similar levels of demand. A recent survey by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that more than half of emergency departments are seeing more patients than they can safely accommodate. The college's president, Dr Taj Hassan, said the NHS was facing a ""crisis"" and called for urgent action to address the problem. ""We are seeing more and more patients coming through our doors, but we are not getting the resources we need to meet demand,"" he said. ""This is putting patients at risk and it is also putting staff under a lot of pressure."" The government has said it is committed to investing in the NHS, but the college says more needs to be done. It is calling for an increase in funding for emergency departments, as well as more staff and more beds. The college is also calling for a review of the way emergency services are provided. It says the current system is too fragmented and does not provide patients with the best possible care. The government has said it is considering the college's proposals, but it is not clear when any changes will be made. In the meantime, emergency departments across the country are continuing to struggle to cope with demand. Dr Jones said the staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital were doing their best to provide the best possible care for their patients, but they were under a lot of pressure. ""We are all working very hard, but it is a challenge,"" she said. ""We need more resources and we need a better way of providing emergency care.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle,"UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle By Laurence Peter BBC News The UK's ruling Conservatives clashed with European judges over a UK ban on prisoners voting. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in 2005 that a blanket ban on prisoners voting was a breach of human rights. However, the UK government has refused to implement the ruling, arguing that it is a matter of national security. In recent months, there have been signs that the government is softening its stance. In March, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""open-minded"" about the possibility of allowing some prisoners to vote. And in June, the government published a consultation paper on the issue. The consultation paper set out two options for reform. The first option would allow prisoners serving sentences of less than four years to vote. The second option would allow all prisoners to vote, except those convicted of serious violent or sexual offences. The consultation closed in September, and the government is now considering the responses. It is expected to announce its decision in the coming months. Some Conservative MPs have expressed concerns about the government's plans. They argue that allowing prisoners to vote would be a betrayal of victims of crime. However, other Conservatives have welcomed the government's move. They argue that it is important to uphold the rule of law and that prisoners should not be denied their basic rights. The issue of prisoner voting is a complex and controversial one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate. Ultimately, it will be up to the government to decide whether or not to change the law. Update: 12 October 2022 The government has now announced its decision on prisoner voting. It has decided to adopt the first option set out in the consultation paper, which will allow prisoners serving sentences of less than four years to vote. The decision has been welcomed by some Conservative MPs, who argue that it is a sensible compromise that will uphold the rule of law while also respecting the rights of prisoners. However, other Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment, arguing that it is a betrayal of victims of crime. The decision is likely to be challenged in the courts. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the government's blanket ban on prisoners voting was unlawful. However, the government argues that the new law is compliant with the Supreme Court's ruling. The issue of prisoner voting is likely to continue to be a source of debate and controversy for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of wife's murder,"Mitesh Patel, 37, denied killing Jessica, 34, and staging a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough. Teesside Crown Court heard he had planned the murder for months, buying chloroform, tape, gloves, and a stun gun. He also created a fake Grindr profile to lure men to the house while Jessica was out. On May 14, 2020, Patel lured victim Anthony Armstrong to the house and attacked him with the stun gun. He then strangled Jessica and staged a burglary to cover up the crime. Armstrong survived the attack and later identified Patel as his attacker. The court heard that Patel was in financial trouble and had been having an affair with a man he met on Grindr. He had also been taking steroids and had a history of domestic violence. The jury heard that Patel had sent a series of text messages to his lover in the weeks leading up to the murder, discussing his plans to kill his wife. In one message, he said: ""I'm going to do it. I'm going to kill her."" Patel was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. The judge said that he had shown ""no remorse"" for his crime and that he was a ""dangerous and manipulative"" individual. The case has shocked the community of Middlesbrough. Jessica's family said they were ""devastated"" by her death and that they could not believe that Patel had killed her. The case has also raised concerns about the safety of Grindr users. The app has been criticized for not doing enough to protect users from predators.

The Lochaber Mountain Rescue team raised the alarm after receiving a call from a member of the public at 8pm on Saturday, sparking a major operation involving several mountain rescue teams, the RAF and coastguard helicopter crews. The team said: ""The group had intended on completing the Ben Nevis Horseshoe but soon lost their way after bad weather closed in. They then tried to descend via Carn Mor Dearg but became disoriented in the worsening conditions. The onset of darkness further complicated matters and the group found themselves stranded on steep ground, having become separated. ""It was apparent the group had no ice axes, no crampons and as far as we are aware, no maps. Three of the group, two men and a woman, sustained serious injuries after falling on the icy slopes."" The injured hikers were airlifted from the mountain to Fort William's Belford Hospital by RAF helicopter, where they were treated for multiple injuries.

Lochaber MRT said: ""This was a protracted and complex rescue involving multiple teams, aircraft and partner agencies. We wish the injured walkers a speedy recovery and commend the actions of the teams involved."" The incident is a reminder of the importance of being well-prepared when heading out into the mountains. The Mountaineering Scotland website advises hikers to plan their route carefully, check the weather forecast and take appropriate clothing and equipment, including an ice axe, crampons and a map.

Stormont deadlock: Sinn Féin to meet Leo Varadkar,"Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said she will tell the British and Irish governments this week that ""direct rule from London is not an option"". McDonald will meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on Wednesday in a bid to break the Stormont deadlock. The meeting comes after the UK government announced plans to introduce legislation that would allow it to unilaterally set a budget for Northern Ireland in the absence of a functioning devolved government. The move has been met with anger by Sinn Féin, which has accused the UK government of ""bullying"" and ""bad faith"". McDonald said she would use her meetings with Varadkar and Heaton-Harris to set out Sinn Féin's position and to ""explore any and all possibilities"" for restoring power-sharing. ""I will be making it very clear to both governments that we will not accept any attempt to impose Tory cuts and austerity on the people of the north by the back door,"" she said. ""Direct rule from London is not an option, and we will not allow it to happen. ""The people of the north have a right to have their say in how they are governed, and that right must be respected."" The Stormont Assembly has been in deadlock since May 2022 after the DUP withdrew from the power-sharing Executive in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK government has said it is prepared to call fresh elections for the Assembly if a new Executive is not formed by the end of October. However, Sinn Féin has said it will not participate in any elections until the UK government agrees to implement the Protocol in full. The Protocol is a part of the Brexit deal that was designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, the DUP has argued that the Protocol has created a trade barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and has damaged the region's economy. The UK government has said it is willing to make changes to the Protocol, but only if the EU agrees. The EU has said it is willing to discuss changes to the Protocol, but only if they do not undermine the integrity of the single market. The Stormont deadlock has left Northern Ireland without a functioning government for over a year. This has led to a number of problems, including a lack of progress on key issues such as health, education, and infrastructure. The deadlock has also damaged Northern Ireland's reputation as a place to do business.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Rower, 72, set to become oldest to cross Atlantic","Graham Walters, from Thurmaston in Leicestershire, is raising money for Help for Heroes by rowing from Gran Canaria to Antigua. This is his fifth and arguably most challenging ocean rowing attempt. If successful, at 72 years old, he will become the oldest person to row solo, unsupported, across the Atlantic Ocean. Graham retired from his job as a financial adviser in 2016 and within a year he was attempting a record-breaking row across the Atlantic Ocean. However, due to a series of injuries and adverse weather conditions, he had to abandon his attempt. Undeterred, in 2018, he set a new Guinness World Record by becoming the oldest person to row solo, unsupported, across the Indian Ocean from Australia to Mauritius. In March 2020, just days before he was due to set off on his second attempt to row the Atlantic, the Covid-19 pandemic forced him to postpone. But on 12 December 2022, Graham finally set off on his Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, a 3,000-mile solo row from Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, to Antigua in the Caribbean. Graham's boat is a Rannoch R45 ocean rowing boat, which is just 23ft long and weighs just 450kg. He will be carrying all of his food, water, and equipment, weighing an additional 200kg. He will be rowing non-stop 24 hours a day. He will be getting food and sleep in short naps, typically in 20-minute bursts. Graham is aiming to raise £100,000 for Help for Heroes, a charity that supports members of the armed forces who have been wounded or injured in the line of duty. He said: ""I'm doing this to raise money for Help for Heroes, a charity that is very close to my heart. I have been supporting them for many years, and I know what a difference they make to the lives of our wounded servicemen and women.

Seychelles protects an area 'as big as Britain' in Indian Ocean,"In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off, the island nation has agreed to protect 210,000 sq km (81,000 sq miles) of ocean. The reserves will ban commercial fishing, oil and gas exploration, and mining. The Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, with a total land area of just 455 sq km (176 sq miles). The new marine protected areas (MPAs) will be more than 400 times larger than the country's landmass. The Seychelles is home to a rich diversity of marine life, including coral reefs, sea turtles, sharks, and rays. The new MPAs will help to protect these species and their habitats from overfishing and other threats. The debt-for-nature swap was arranged by The Nature Conservancy, a US-based environmental organization. The Seychelles government will receive $21 million to pay off its debt, and The Nature Conservancy will provide technical assistance to help the government manage the new MPAs. The debt-for-nature swap is a win-win for the Seychelles and for the environment. The Seychelles will get some of its debt paid off, and the new MPAs will help to protect the country's marine resources. The Seychelles is not the first country to use a debt-for-nature swap to protect its environment. In 2016, Belize agreed to protect 30% of its territorial waters in exchange for getting $586 million of its debt paid off. Debt-for-nature swaps are a creative way to finance conservation efforts. They can help countries to protect their environment while also reducing their debt burden. The Seychelles' new MPAs are a significant step forward in the fight to protect the world's oceans. They will help to ensure that future generations can enjoy the beauty and bounty of the Seychelles' marine environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Rise in ambulance delays at South East hospitals,"South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) figures show ambulances had 36,000 hours ""handover time"" in 2011/12, 50% more than three years ago. The service says it's ""very concerned"" by the trend. Ambulances waiting to handover patients to A&E staff have more than doubled in some areas of Kent over the period, analysts found. In November 2012, SECAmb reported delays of more than an hour at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford on 115 occasions, compared to just five the same month in 2011. Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham reported 104 hour-long delays, and Maidstone Hospital had 23. SECAmb boss Paul Sutton said it was a ""national problem"". He told BBC South East Today: ""It's not just about putting more ambulances on the road. It's about the whole system."" SECAmb said delays occur when ambulances are stuck outside A&E departments waiting to hand over patients to hospital staff. The handover process can take several hours, and during that time the ambulance crew is unavailable to respond to other calls. SECAmb said the increase in handover time was putting a strain on its resources. The service said it was working with hospitals to find ways to reduce handover delays but admitted it was a ""complex"" issue with no easy solutions. The BBC understands that delays are being caused by a number of factors, including the increasing number of elderly and frail patients who need more time to be assessed and admitted to hospital. Another factor is the number of patients who are staying in hospital for longer periods of time, which means there are fewer beds available for new admissions. The delays are also being caused by a shortage of nurses in A&E departments, which means that patients are waiting longer to be seen by a doctor.

Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina resigns,"Prosecutors accuse Mr Perez Molina of masterminding a scheme to defraud the customs service of millions of dollars. He denies the allegations. On Tuesday, Congress stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, paving the way for him to be arrested and charged. Mr Perez Molina, a retired general, becomes the latest in a string of Latin American presidents to be embroiled in corruption scandals. His resignation comes amid growing public anger over corruption and impunity in Guatemala. The scandal, known as ""La Linea"" (The Line), is alleged to have involved a network of officials and businesspeople who charged importers bribes in exchange for reducing their customs duties. The scheme is said to have operated for several years, netting millions of dollars. Mr Perez Molina has denied any involvement in the scandal, but several of his close associates have been arrested, including his former vice-president, Roxana Baldetti. The resignation of Mr Perez Molina is a major victory for the anti-corruption movement in Guatemala. It is also a sign that the region's leaders are becoming increasingly vulnerable to prosecution for corruption. In recent years, several other Latin American presidents have been accused of corruption, including Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina, and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela. Some of these leaders have been impeached or removed from office, while others are still facing charges. The corruption scandals in Latin America have led to widespread public anger and protests. Citizens are demanding greater transparency and accountability from their governments. The resignation of Mr Perez Molina is a sign that these demands are being heard. It is too early to say whether Mr Perez Molina's resignation will lead to lasting change in Guatemala. However, it is a clear sign that the country's citizens are no longer willing to tolerate corruption and impunity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore',"Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: ""I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing."" Boeing is fighting for its reputation and survival after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max jet. The company has been accused of putting profits before safety, and its relationship with the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has come under scrutiny. In the wake of the crashes, Boeing has made changes to the design of the 737 Max and its safety protocols. However, some experts believe that the company's problems go beyond the technical issues with the aircraft. ""Boeing has a culture problem,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group. ""They have been focused on cost-cutting and shareholder returns, and they have lost sight of their core mission of safety."" Boeing has admitted that it made mistakes in the design and certification of the 737 Max. The company has also agreed to pay billions of dollars in compensation to the families of the victims of the crashes. However, some experts believe that Boeing's problems are more deep-rooted. They argue that the company has lost its way and that it needs to undergo a fundamental change in its culture. ""Boeing needs to go back to its roots,"" said Aboulafia. ""They need to focus on building safe, reliable aircraft, and they need to put the interests of their customers first."" Boeing's future is uncertain. The company is facing a number of legal challenges, and its reputation has been badly damaged. However, Boeing is a resilient company with a long history of innovation. It remains to be seen whether Boeing can overcome its current challenges and regain the trust of its customers. In the meantime, Ms Kuria's comments are a reminder of the importance of trust in the aviation industry. Passengers need to be able to trust that the aircraft they are flying on are safe. Boeing has a lot of work to do to rebuild that trust.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Peter Sutcliffe victim highlights 'imbalance of justice' for women,"Mo Lea, 61, from Bedford, was an art student in Leeds in 1980 when she was attacked by a man with a hammer. She has been named as one of the likely victims of Sutcliffe, but despite suffering life-changing injuries including a fractured skull, permanent sight loss in one eye and severe brain damage, Sutcliffe was never charged with her attempted murder. ""I think about him every day,"" Mo told the BBC. ""The fact he is dead doesn't make life any easier. I don't feel any closure. I am still living with the consequences of what he did to me."" Mo's story is one of many that highlights the historical imbalance of justice for women who were victims of serious sexual and violent crime. In Sutcliffe's case, his victims were predominantly women from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were often sex workers or runaways. This meant that their cases were often treated with less seriousness by police and the justice system, and they were less likely to be believed or taken seriously. ""When you are seen as being of less value by society, you are less likely to get justice,"" said Diane Taylor, chief executive of Leeds Women's Aid. ""It's a sad indictment of our society that women like Mo have to fight for recognition and justice."" In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the historical injustice faced by women victims of violence. This has been partly driven by campaigns by women's rights groups and the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. As a result, there have been some changes in the way that police and the justice system deal with cases of violence against women. For example, there is now a greater focus on victim support and the need to believe and take seriously the experiences of women who report crimes. However, Mo believes that there is still more to be done to address the historical imbalance of justice for women. ""I think it's really important that we don't forget the women who were victims of Peter Sutcliffe and other serial killers,"" she said. ""They deserve to be remembered and their stories need to be told."" Mo also believes that more needs to be done to support women who have been victims of violence and to help them access justice. ""There needs to be more support for women who have suffered serious sexual and violent crime,"" she said. ""They need to be able to access specialist services that can help them to cope with the trauma they have experienced and to get the justice they deserve.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid-19: Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry move into tier 2,"Restrictions came into force at 00:01 BST on Saturday. Slough has also moved into the tier two ""high"" category. The restrictions in tier two mean households can no longer mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants, unless those venues are serving substantial meals. People are also advised against travelling in and out of the affected areas. Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Abi Brown said: ""These restrictions may not be what we wanted to hear, but they are absolutely necessary to protect our residents and communities. We know that the vast majority of people in Stoke-on-Trent have been following the guidance and doing everything they can to stop the spread of the virus."" She added: ""But we cannot be complacent. This is not the time to let our guard down. We must all continue to follow the guidance and do everything we can to protect ourselves and others."" Coventry City Council leader George Duggins said: ""We are very disappointed that Coventry has been placed in tier two. We have been working hard to keep the number of cases down in our city, and we believe that we have been successful in doing so."" He added: ""However, we understand the government's decision and we will be working with them to ensure that the restrictions are implemented effectively. We urge all Coventry residents to follow the guidance and do everything they can to stop the spread of the virus."" The move to tier two comes as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in the UK. On Friday, the government announced that there had been 17,234 new cases of the virus in the UK, the highest daily total since May. The government has said that it will review the tier system on a weekly basis, and that areas could be moved up or down the tiers depending on the number of cases and the rate of transmission.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Budget 2020: The chancellor's very large cheque book,"Rishi Sunak has barely been in one of the biggest jobs in the country for a month, but he has already pulled out his biggest weapon - the cheque book. Wednesday's Budget was never going to be a normal one. The new chancellor arrived in Parliament with the weight of Brexit uncertainty lifting, but the looming threat of the coronavirus hanging over everything. So, he used his set-piece speech to set out how he wants the UK to look in the years to come, with big investment in infrastructure, changes to taxation for businesses and a boost to the NHS. It was a budget based on the idea that the government could spend its way out of trouble, without worrying too much about what it might mean for the long-term. But this was also a Budget that was trying to do too much. It wanted to fix the nation's creaky infrastructure, simultaneously invest in the NHS, and then slash taxes for businesses. The result is a plan that looks like it has been cobbled together from the ideas of three or four different chancellors. The green bits - the money for new infrastructure, the support for electric cars - are very much in keeping with the direction of travel of Boris Johnson's government. The bits that focus on public services - the extra doctors, the nurses, the schools - are what you would expect from a Conservative government. And then there are the tax cuts - a classic Thatcherite policy that seemed to catch some of the chancellor's cabinet colleagues off guard. Ultimately, this was a Budget that lacked a coherent narrative. It was an attempt to do too much, and in doing so, risked losing focus. The chancellor used the language of investment and growth, but at the heart of the Budget was an old-fashioned Conservative philosophy - let's give businesses a tax break and they'll pass it on to their workers. That's a gamble. It's also the opposite of the approach taken by the chancellor's predecessor, Sajid Javid, who wanted to use the tax system to create a fairer society. It's a big gamble and it's one that could backfire spectacularly. But then again, Rishi Sunak is a politician who likes to rewrite the rules.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Astronaut Scott Kelly attacked for quoting Winston Churchill,"American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. Kelly, who spent a year on the International Space Station in 2015 and 2016, is a big fan of Churchill and often quotes him on social media. But his recent tweet about Churchill's quote on democracy sparked a backlash, with many accusing him of supporting Churchill's views on race and empire. ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time,"" Kelly tweeted, quoting Churchill. The tweet was quickly met with criticism from people who pointed out that Churchill also believed in the superiority of the white race and supported the British Empire. ""I'm sorry, but I can't support someone who quotes Winston Churchill,"" tweeted one person. ""His views on race and empire were abhorrent."" ""Churchill was a racist and an imperialist,"" tweeted another. ""He has no place in modern society."" Kelly has since deleted the tweet and apologized for any offense he caused. ""I apologize if my tweet caused any offense,"" he tweeted. ""I am a big fan of Churchill's leadership during World War II, but I do not endorse his views on race and empire."" However, some people believe that Kelly should not have apologized for quoting Churchill. ""I think it's important to remember that Churchill was a complex figure,"" said historian Andrew Roberts. ""He was a great leader who also had some very flawed views. We should not judge him by today's standards."" The debate over Churchill's legacy is likely to continue for many years to come. He was a complex figure who made both great and terrible decisions. It is up to each individual to decide how they view him.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Shrewsbury 24': MPs vote for release of government papers,"Campaigners want to quash convictions against 24 men who were accused of violent picketing and intimidating workers in Shropshire, in 1972. The men, known as the ""Shrewsbury 24"", were convicted following a 15-week trial and have spent decades campaigning to clear their names. MPs voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to release papers relating to the case, which campaigners say could prove the men's innocence. The motion was passed by 270 votes to 0, with 23 Conservative MPs abstaining. It called on the government to release all ""relevant papers"" relating to the case, including those that are currently withheld on national security grounds. The government has said it is ""carefully considering"" the motion, but has not yet committed to releasing the papers. The Shrewsbury 24 were convicted of conspiracy to intimidate, unlawful assembly, and affray. They were accused of attacking non-striking workers and damaging property during a strike at the Shrewsbury plant of the construction company, GKN Sankey. The men have always maintained their innocence, and their supporters say that the convictions were based on fabricated evidence. In 2018, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. The CCRC said there was ""a real possibility"" that the men's convictions would be quashed. The Court of Appeal is currently considering the case. The release of the government papers could provide crucial evidence in the appeal. The campaigners say that the papers could show that the police and security services fabricated evidence against the men. They also say that the papers could show that the government was involved in a cover-up. The government has said that it is ""committed to transparency"" and that it will release the papers if it is ""appropriate to do so"". However, the government has not yet said when it will make a decision on the matter. The campaigners have welcomed the vote in Parliament, but they say that the government must now act quickly to release the papers. A spokesperson for the Shrewsbury 24 Campaign said: ""This is a historic moment. The vote in Parliament shows that there is overwhelming support for the release of the government papers. ""We now call on the government to act quickly and release the papers in full. The men have waited decades for justice, and they deserve to have their names cleared.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail,"Maplin, which has more than 200 stores and 2,300 staff, will continue to trade through the process. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence, and a withdrawal of credit. Jeremy Fry, restructuring partner at PwC, which has been appointed administrator to the firm, said: ""We will be working closely with management to help preserve value for all stakeholders. Our immediate priority is to assess the financial position of the business and consider all options available."" Maplin has been hit by the downturn in the consumer electronics market, as well as the rising cost of importing goods from overseas. The company has also been struggling to compete with online retailers, such as Amazon. The collapse of Maplin is the latest in a series of high-profile retail failures in recent months. Toys R Us, House of Fraser, and Poundworld have all gone into administration in the past year. The retail sector is facing a number of challenges, including the rise of online shopping, the increasing cost of business rates, and a squeeze on consumer spending. Experts warn that more retailers could collapse in the coming months, as the sector continues to grapple with these challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Colchester Hospital: Police launch formal inquiry,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said earlier this month Colchester Hospital staff were ""pressured or bullied"" to change data. Essex Police announced on Tuesday it would be investigating. NHS England also revealed details of a review. The inquiry will consider whether staff were pressured to change patient data, the impact this has had on patient care, the extent of the issue within the hospital, and the actions taken to address it. The CQC's report, published on 4 July, found that staff at the hospital had been altering data to meet targets. This included changing the time patients were admitted and discharged, and the length of time they spent in hospital. The report also found that staff were ""pressured or bullied"" to change data by their managers. This was done in order to make the hospital look better in performance tables. The CQC said that the data manipulation had ""a negative impact on patient care"". This was because it meant that patients were not always receiving the correct treatment. The police investigation will now consider whether any criminal offences have been committed. NHS England has also announced that it will be conducting a review of the hospital. This review will look at the extent of the data manipulation and the actions taken to address it. The review will also make recommendations on how to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The hospital has said that it is ""fully cooperating"" with the police and NHS England investigations. It has also said that it is ""committed to providing high-quality care to its patients"". The hospital has been under increasing pressure in recent months. In March, it was placed in special measures by the CQC. This means that it is subject to additional monitoring and support from the CQC. The hospital is also facing financial difficulties. It has a deficit of £11 million and is planning to make cuts to its services. The CQC's report and the police investigation are likely to add to the pressure on the hospital. It is now facing the prospect of criminal charges and further sanctions from the CQC. The hospital is now at a crossroads. It needs to address the serious issues that have been raised by the CQC and the police. It also needs to find a way to improve its financial position. If the hospital can do this, it has the potential to become a good hospital. However, if it fails to address these issues, it is likely to face further decline.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tidal energy project proposed off Bardsey Island,"Local community enterprise YnNi Llyn has teamed up with Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation to explore the possibility of deploying a 3MW tidal energy array off Bardsey Island, north Wales. The project, which would be the first of its kind in Wales, could generate enough electricity to power around 2,000 homes. It would also create jobs and boost the local economy. Tidal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that can be generated from the movement of the tides. Nova Innovation is a world-leading developer of tidal energy technology. The company's turbines are designed to be low-impact and fish-friendly. The proposed tidal energy array would be located in the Bardsey Sound, between Bardsey Island and the Llŷn Peninsula. The site has strong tidal currents and is well-suited for tidal energy generation. YnNi Llyn is a community-owned enterprise that is working to develop renewable energy projects in the Llŷn Peninsula. The company is committed to working with local communities to ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are shared by all. The tidal energy project is still in the early stages of development. However, YnNi Llyn and Nova Innovation are confident that it has the potential to be a major success. ""This project has the potential to transform the way we generate energy in Wales,"" said YnNi Llyn project manager Geraint Jones. ""Tidal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that can help us to reduce our carbon emissions and create jobs."" ""We are delighted to be working with YnNi Llyn on this exciting project,"" said Nova Innovation CEO Simon Forrest. ""We believe that our tidal energy technology can make a significant contribution to the UK's renewable energy targets."" The project has been welcomed by local politicians and environmental groups. ""This project is a great example of how communities can work together to develop renewable energy projects,"" said local MS Sian Gwenlli. ""It has the potential to create jobs, boost the local economy, and reduce our carbon emissions."" ""We are very supportive of this project,"" said Friends of the Earth Cymru campaigner Dewi Williams. ""Tidal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that can help us to tackle the climate crisis."" The project is expected to be submitted for planning permission in the coming months.

Why India’s mobile users go offline for video,"By Prasanto K Roy Technology writer It sells odds and ends, and DVD discs, each with up to 10 movies of doubtful quality. Asim Mandal, 26, a checkout clerk at a local retailer, is a regular. He pops out his phone's memory card and hands it over to the shop owner. In return, he is handed back a fresh card featuring the latest - and equally dubious - Bollywood blockbusters. ""I have five, six cards at home, Each one has different films on it,"" he says. ""I watch them on my phone when I'm at work, or when I'm travelling."" Mandal is not alone. Many Indians who have low-quality or unreliable internet access prefer to download movies and store them on memory cards so that they can be watched offline later. It is a phenomenon that is particularly common in smaller towns and villages, where data connectivity can be patchy or expensive. ""I don't have a Wi-Fi connection at home, and my mobile data is very slow,"" says 19-year-old college student Soniya Gupta. ""So I download movies onto my phone when I'm at college, and then watch them later."" The trend has been boosted by the rise of cheap smartphones and memory cards. Even low-end phones now have enough storage space to hold several movies, and memory cards are widely available for less than $10. This offline viewing trend is not unique to India. In many developing countries, where internet access is limited or expensive, people often download content to watch later. But in India, the practice is particularly widespread. There are several reasons for this. First, India has a large population of low-income earners who cannot afford to pay for high-speed internet. Second, the country's mobile networks are often congested, making it difficult to stream video smoothly. Third, India has a strong tradition of piracy, and many people are willing to download copyrighted content illegally. The offline viewing trend has had a significant impact on the Indian film industry. In the past, people who lived in rural areas had to wait for months or even years to see the latest Bollywood releases. Now, they can download them within days of their release. This has led to a decline in ticket sales at movie theaters in smaller towns and villages. But it has also created new opportunities for filmmakers. Bollywood producers are now making more low-budget films that are specifically targeted at the offline market. These films are often made with smaller casts and crews, and they feature less-known actors. But they are still able to generate significant profits, thanks to the large number of people who watch them offline. The offline viewing trend is likely to continue to grow in India in the coming years. As more and more people gain access to smartphones and memory cards, they will be able to enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows whenever and wherever they want.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hospital funding issues put local MPs on the spot,"The irony is that the private finance initiative was devised by the previous Conservative administration. But it was Labour who adopted it with a will, as a way of replacing crumbling or outdated hospital buildings. The PFI scheme meant that hospitals were built by private companies, which then leased the buildings back to the NHS. The NHS paid a rent for the buildings over a period of many years, often 30 or 40 years. The intention was to provide new hospitals quickly and without having to make the full cost of the building immediately available. But the PFI scheme has been criticised for being expensive and inflexible. Critics argue that the NHS has been paying too much rent for the buildings, and that the leases have prevented the NHS from making changes it would like to make. In recent years, the government has been moving away from PFI as a way of funding new hospitals. Instead, it has been using a system called the Public Sector Comparator, which is designed to be more transparent and flexible. However, the legacy of PFI continues to haunt the NHS. Many hospitals are still paying rent on PFI-funded buildings, and the contracts can be difficult to break. This is putting pressure on NHS budgets and making it difficult for hospitals to invest in new services and equipment. Local MPs are now being put on the spot by angry constituents who are demanding to know why their local hospitals are struggling for funding. In some cases, MPs are being accused of not doing enough to stand up for their local NHS services. One MP who has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the government's handling of the NHS is Labour's David Winnick. Winnick has accused the government of ""underfunding"" the NHS and of failing to address the problems caused by PFI. He has also called for the government to scrap the PFI scheme and to invest more money in the NHS. The government has defended its record on the NHS, arguing that it has increased funding for the health service in recent years. However, the government has also acknowledged that the NHS is facing financial challenges, and it has said that it is working to address these challenges. The debate over NHS funding is likely to continue in the run-up to the next general election. The NHS is a vital part of the UK's public services, and it is essential that it is properly funded.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scotland's economy grows by 0.1%,"The GDP (gross domestic product) figures for the second quarter were down from the 0.6% growth at the start of 2017. Scotland's first quarter figures were above the equivalent rate for the UK as a whole. The GDP figures are compiled by the Scottish government and measure the value of all goods and services produced in Scotland. They are used to track the performance of the Scottish economy and to compare it to the performance of the UK economy as a whole. The second quarter figures, which cover the period from April to June 2017, showed that the Scottish economy grew by 0.1%. This was down from the 0.6% growth recorded in the first quarter of the year. The UK economy as a whole grew by 0.3% in the second quarter. The slowdown in growth in the second quarter was driven by a number of factors, including a decline in oil and gas production and a slowdown in manufacturing. However, the Scottish economy is still performing better than the UK economy as a whole. Over the past year, the Scottish economy has grown by 1.2%, compared to 1.1% for the UK as a whole. The Scottish government welcomed the latest GDP figures, but said that there was still more to be done to improve the performance of the economy. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""These figures show that the Scottish economy is continuing to grow, but we are not complacent. We are determined to create a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Scotland for everyone."" The UK government also welcomed the latest GDP figures, but said that the figures showed that the UK economy was still facing challenges. A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""These figures show that the UK economy is continuing to grow, but we are not complacent. We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few."" The latest GDP figures have been met with mixed reactions from economists. Some economists have praised the Scottish government for its handling of the economy, while others have said that more needs to be done to improve the performance of the economy.

He said the poster was about ""highlighting the problems of uncontrolled immigration"" and that it was ""not about race"". The poster has been widely condemned by anti-racism campaigners, who say it is racist and divisive. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said the poster was ""a new low in British politics"" and that it ""demonstrates a frightening disregard for the feelings of minority communities in this country"". The Stop Hate UK campaign group said the poster was ""a blatant attempt to stir up racial hatred"" and that it ""should be condemned by all decent people"".

India PM Narendra Modi warning about religious attacks,"By Sanjoy Majumder BBC News In one instance, a Catholic church was burned down in a suburb of the capital. The violence has upset India's Christian community, which is a small but visible and influential minority. Church leaders have alleged that some of the attacks have been carried out by Hindu nationalist groups. The government denies that it tolerates violence against religious minorities. However, critics say that it has not done enough to protect Christians and other religious minorities from attack. In a speech to mark Christmas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attacks on Christians and said that violence against any religious group was ""unacceptable"". He also appealed for religious harmony and peace. ""Violence against any religion is unacceptable,"" Modi said. ""We must respect every religion and every faith. There is no place for violence in a civilised society."" Modi's speech was welcomed by some Christian leaders, but others said that it did not go far enough. They called on the government to take more concrete steps to protect Christians and other religious minorities from attack. In recent years, there has been a rise in communal violence in India. According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 282 incidents of communal violence in 2020, up from 230 in 2019. The majority of the victims of communal violence are Muslims, but Christians have also been targeted. In 2020, there were 35 incidents of violence against Christians, up from 26 in 2019. The violence has raised concerns about the safety of religious minorities in India. Some Christian leaders have said that they fear that the country is becoming increasingly intolerant. The Indian government has said that it is committed to protecting religious freedom and that it will not tolerate violence against any religious group. However, critics say that the government needs to do more to address the root causes of communal violence and to ensure that all religious minorities feel safe and secure.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pakistan is hit by dengue fever epidemic,"By M Ilyas Khan BBC News, Islamabad They have warned that it threatens to affect other parts of the country. More than 2,000 cases have been reported so far this year, with nearly half of them in Punjab province. Health officials say they are struggling to contain the outbreak due to a lack of resources and awareness about the disease. ""We are facing a shortage of doctors, nurses, and medicine,"" said Dr. Rana Safdar, a spokesman for the Punjab Health Department. ""We also need to raise awareness about dengue fever so that people can protect themselves."" Dengue fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and nausea. In severe cases, dengue fever can lead to bleeding, organ failure, and death. The outbreak in Pakistan has been blamed on a number of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor sanitation, and a lack of mosquito control measures. ""We have been seeing a lot of rain this year, which has created breeding grounds for mosquitoes,"" said Dr. Safdar. ""We also need to improve our sanitation practices and do a better job of controlling mosquitoes."" The Pakistani government has launched a campaign to raise awareness about dengue fever and to encourage people to take steps to protect themselves. The campaign includes distributing pamphlets, airing public service announcements, and setting up mosquito traps. However, health officials say that more needs to be done to contain the outbreak. They are calling on the government to provide more resources and to do a better job of coordinating efforts between different agencies. ""We need to take this outbreak seriously,"" said Dr. Safdar. ""If we don't, it could spread to other parts of the country and cause a major health crisis.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Condor Ferries bought by investment fund,"Condor currently operates between Portsmouth, Poole, Guernsey, Jersey and St Malo, and carries about a million passengers every year. The company was put up for sale in 2018 by its Australian owner the Macquarie Group, which bought it in 2010. Condor's current fleet consists of three fast ferries: Condor Liberation, Condor Voyager and Condor Rapide, as well as two conventional ferries Condor Express and Commodore Goodwill. The company has been facing financial difficulties in recent years, with losses of £13.3m in 2017 and £10.2m in 2018. Macquarie Group said it had decided to sell Condor as it was ""no longer core to its investment strategy"". The sale to Columbia Threadneedle Investments is expected to be completed in the coming months. Columbia Threadneedle Investments is a global investment management firm with over £450bn of assets under management. The company said it was ""delighted"" to have acquired Condor Ferries. ""Condor Ferries is a well-respected and well-run business with a strong track record and a loyal customer base,"" said Columbia Threadneedle Investments managing director John Godden. ""We are committed to working with the Condor team to continue to provide a high quality service to its customers.""

Ant and Dec 'wanted to quit' Britain's Got Talent,"The presenting duo felt they were being ""sidelined"", as segments they filmed for the audition shows kept ""ending up on the cutting room floor"". ""It felt like it may as well have been anyone hosting the show,"" wrote The Sun on Sunday, quoting a source close to the pair. ""They have been left disheartened by the way they've been treated after all these years. Now they're saying they want out."" Ant and Dec declined to comment on their future involvement with Britain's Got Talent when contacted by the BBC. However, ITV sources say they are ""in talks"" with the duo about their future. The company's new chief executive, Carolyn McCall, is said to be keen to keep the pair on board. Ant and Dec's reported disquiet over their role on Britain's Got Talent comes amid a wider shake-up of the show. Long-serving judge David Walliams announced he was leaving the programme earlier this month, and Simon Cowell has hinted that other changes are in the pipeline. ""I think it's a good time to refresh the panel,"" Cowell told The Sun on Sunday. ""We're getting close to the 15th season of the show and I think it's a good time to do it."" It is not clear whether Ant and Dec's decision to quit Britain's Got Talent is linked to the wider changes being made to the show. However, it is clear that the duo are unhappy with their current role. Ant and Dec are one of the most popular and successful TV presenting duos in the UK. They have hosted Britain's Got Talent since its inception in 2007, and have also fronted other popular shows such as I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and Saturday Night Takeaway. Their departure from Britain's Got Talent would be a major blow to the show. However, it is also possible that the duo could return to the programme in a different capacity in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Over to you, chancellor","Although a cut of a quarter of a percent was not a surprise, a specific message that it would happen was. The Bank welcomed the Budget and claimed it would reduce the risk of a recession. Mr Bailey also reiterated that keeping inflation under control was the Bank's priority. ""There are some signs that global inflation may have peaked, and, of course, there are the energy markets,"" he said. ""It's going to be bumpy, and there are still a lot of risks and uncertainties out there."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) now expects inflation to fall to around 5% by the end of this year, and to the 2% target by 2024. But the committee also revised down its growth forecasts for 2023, from 1.5% to 0.75%. Mr Bailey said the UK economy had ""weakened materially"" since the Bank's last meeting in November, and that the outlook had ""deteriorated materially"". The Bank's decision will have come as a relief to some businesses, which had been calling for a cut in interest rates to help them through the cost of living crisis. But it is likely to be seen as a blow to savers, who have seen the value of their savings eroded by high inflation. The cut in interest rates is the first since March 2020, when the Bank slashed rates to a record low of 0.1% in response to the Covid pandemic. Since then, the Bank has raised rates nine times in a row, as it tries to get inflation under control. The Bank's decision to cut rates now suggests that it believes the economy is slowing down and that the risk of a recession is increasing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions,"Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions By Patrick Cowling & Sadaf Maruf BBC News Home Office figures obtained by the BBC show delays have almost tripled since January 2014, when 484 children had been waiting for more than six months for an asylum decision. Last year, 1,272 under-18s were waiting this long, rising to about 1,300 this year. The situation is so bad, a number of children have received support from specialist trafficking lawyers to argue their asylum cases should be heard more quickly. This is because the government initially refused to screen them for potential risks of harm, such as torture or sexual exploitation. The UK is signed up to the Dublin regulations, which state that asylum applications should be processed in the first safe country an individual enters. But the system does not put a time limit on how long that should take. However, last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the lack of a time limit meant children could be left in legal limbo, and member states have a duty of care. This is why the lawyers have been able to use the court's ruling to challenge the Home Office. They argue that delays, particularly when there has not been an initial screening process, can mean children at risk of serious harm are not identified. The government is now reconsidering its screening policy following a recent judicial review. But Liberty, which brought the case, says there is still no firm commitment from the Home Office to screen all asylum-seeking children. Processing delays in deciding asylum cases are also affecting adults. Home Office data shows it takes around four months on average for a decision to be made about an adult's asylum application. But some foreigners have to wait years to find out if they have the right to remain in the UK. Iraqis are among those who have been experiencing the longest delays and in many cases, have been left destitute, forced into homelessness and barred from work. There are concerns that many have already given up and returned to their home countries. The Home Office says it is processing asylum cases as quickly as possible and that it encourages any asylum seekers who face hardship while their application is being considered to apply for support.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hong Kong: What is China's 'patriot' plan for electoral reform?,"Beijing says the goal is to keep ""unpatriotic"" figures from positions of political power in Hong Kong. But critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, eradicating whatever opposition there is. Under the proposals, a new vetting committee would be set up to screen all candidates for public office. This committee would be composed of members loyal to Beijing, and would have the power to disqualify anyone deemed to be a threat to national security. In addition, the number of directly elected seats in the Legislative Council would be reduced from 35 to 20, while the number of seats appointed by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee would be increased from 30 to 40. These changes would give the pro-Beijing camp an overwhelming majority in the legislature, making it virtually impossible for the opposition to block any government proposals. Critics say these measures would effectively dismantle Hong Kong's democratic system, turning it into a one-party state like mainland China. ""This is a clear attempt to silence dissent and eliminate any form of opposition in Hong Kong,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo. ""It would mark the end of democracy in Hong Kong."" The proposals have also been condemned by the international community. The United States has said that they would ""fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms."" The United Kingdom has said that the proposals ""raise serious concerns about the future of democracy in Hong Kong."" Despite the international outcry, Beijing has remained defiant. It has said that the proposals are necessary to ""safeguard national security"" and ""maintain stability"" in Hong Kong. It is unclear whether Beijing will ultimately go ahead with the proposals. However, the fact that they have been put forward at all is a sign of the increasing pressure that Beijing is putting on Hong Kong. Democracy in Hong Kong has been in decline for several years. In 2014, pro-democracy protesters occupied the streets of Hong Kong for 79 days in a failed attempt to force the government to introduce universal suffrage. Since then, Beijing has cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, arresting pro-democracy activists and closing down independent media outlets. The new electoral reform proposals are the latest in a series of measures designed to tighten Beijing's control over the city. The future of democracy in Hong Kong is uncertain. However, the new electoral reform proposals are a clear indication that Beijing is determined to end it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Iran scientist Shahram Amiri free to leave, US insists","The state department rejected claims by Tehran that Shahram Amiri, who surfaced at a Pakistani embassy building, had been abducted by US agents. Mr Amiri vanished more than a year ago. In June, three videos apparently showing him distressed and allegedly held in the US against his will, were posted on the website of Iranian state media. Later, Iranian state television aired what it said was a phone conversation between Mr Amiri and his mother, in which he said he had been kidnapped by the US, and did not know his whereabouts. On Friday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said the US ""kidnapped"" Mr Amiri in Saudi Arabia in 2009, and the claims he had been working voluntarily for the CIA were untrue. If Mr Amiri's claims are true, it would mean that his account of being forcibly taken from Saudi Arabia to the US contradicts an earlier statement on Iranian state television, which he allegedly made in a phone call to his mother. The phone call to his mother was reported to have taken place on 14 June, while the alleged abduction by US agents is said to have taken place in 2009. However, if Mr Amiri's claims are accurate, it would mean that he was already in US custody at the time of the phone call, which would suggest that the claims made in the phone call are not true. In the videos, Mr Amiri said he was a nuclear scientist working for the Iranian government, and claimed he had been abducted by the US in 2009. The US state department said the videos were ""not credible"", and that Mr Amiri was free to leave the US and return to Iran whenever he wanted. Mr Amiri was a professor at Malek Ashtar University, a military academy in Tehran, and was reportedly involved in Iran's nuclear programme. He disappeared in June 2009 while on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. His wife previously said she believed he was abducted by US agents, but later said she thought he had voluntarily defected to the US.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago,"Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago By Helen Briggs BBC News Scientists found fossilised butterfly scales the size of a speck of dust inside ancient rock from Germany. The find pushes back the date for the origins of the Lepidoptera, the scientific order which includes butterflies and moths, by an extraordinary 25 million years. Previous butterfly fossils had only been found in ancient rocks dating back no more than 175 million years. Now, a team of German researchers has unearthed 12 fossilised butterfly scales trapped in rock around 40m years older than anything seen before. The Lepidoptera evolved from a moth-like ancestor, but the deep fossil record for butterflies is scarce. Studying the microscopic scales under an electron microscope, the researchers noticed finger-like indentations and other features that are characteristic of butterflies, distinguishing them from moth scales. The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest that butterflies emerged earlier than previously thought, perhaps as early as 200 million years ago during the Triassic period. ""This makes our butterflies the oldest modern butterflies ever found,"" said study lead author Dr. André Nel of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. The butterfly scales were found in fine-grained limestone rock that was once mud and silt at the bottom of a shallow ocean. The limestone was deposited in what is now the Saar region in western Germany. Dr. Nel said that the discovery was ""wonderful and very exciting"" and added that the butterflies would have been tiny, about the size of a hummingbird. “We see an incredible diversity of butterflies in the Triassic,” he said, adding: “It means that as soon as butterflies appear, they show a rather large amount of anatomical variation."" The researchers say that the butterfly scales, with their display of fine features that are diagnostic for butterfly scales, are unlikely to be mistaken for those of any other insect group. They conclude that butterflies probably went through an explosive evolutionary episode in the middle of the Triassic. The team now plans to look for butterfly fossils in other ancient rocks. They hope to find preserved adult butterfly fossils, which would give a better idea of how these creatures looked 200 million years ago.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Guildford Four's Gerry Conlon: Funeral takes place in Belfast,"His coffin was carried into St Peter's Cathedral in west Belfast by four members of the Birmingham Six. Mr Conlon, who was wrongly convicted of the IRA pub bombings in 1974, died on 21 June aged 60. Among the mourners at the funeral were Mr Conlon's sisters, Anne and Kate, and his brother, Michael. His wife, Sarah, died in 2008. The service was led by Bishop Noel Treanor, who said Mr Conlon was ""a man of courage, resilience and dignity"". ""He was an innocent man who was never broken by the injustice he suffered,"" the bishop said. ""He never gave up hope that one day he would be free and cleared of the terrible crimes he was falsely accused of."" The service was followed by a private burial at Milltown Cemetery. Mr Conlon's wrongful conviction was one of the most high-profile miscarriages of justice in British legal history. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1975, along with five other men who became known as the Guildford Four. The four were convicted of carrying out the IRA pub bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974, which killed five people and injured many others. However, their convictions were overturned in 1989 after it emerged that police had fabricated evidence against them. Mr Conlon spent 15 years in prison before he was finally released. He went on to campaign for justice for other victims of miscarriages of justice. In 2001, he was awarded £5m in compensation for his wrongful conviction. In a statement released after his death, Mr Conlon's family said he had been ""a loving husband, father, brother and uncle"". ""He was a man of great integrity and courage, who never gave up fighting for justice,"" the statement said. ""He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Boris Johnson seeks spokesperson to front White House-style briefings,"The job, advertised on the Conservative LinkedIn page, is described as a chance to ""communicate with the nation on behalf of the prime minister"". ""Essential skills"" include ""excellent risk management and media handling experience"". The role is the latest in a series of measures designed to enhance Johnson's public image, which has suffered in recent months due to the ongoing Partygate scandal and the cost-of-living crisis. Critics have described the move as a ""PR stunt"" and a ""waste of taxpayers' money"". Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: ""This is yet another desperate attempt by Boris Johnson to cling on to power. He has lost the trust of the public and his own party, and this latest move will do nothing to change that."" However, Johnson's allies have defended the decision, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that the prime minister's message is communicated effectively to the public. Downing Street sources said that the new spokesperson would not be a ""mouthpiece for the prime minister"", but would instead provide ""factual information about the government's work and policies"". The move is also seen as an attempt to emulate the White House press briefings, which are held daily by the US president's press secretary. These briefings have become a key part of the US political landscape, and are closely followed by journalists and the public alike. It is unclear whether the new spokesperson will be as successful as their White House counterparts. However, the move is a clear sign that Johnson is determined to improve his public image and regain the trust of the British people. Only time will tell whether the new spokesperson will be able to achieve this goal.

EU-student funding guarantee extended,"By Katherine Sellgren BBC News education reporter And these students' loans and grants will be available for the duration of their degree. This is because the Department for Education has extended its funding guarantee for EU students, who started courses in England in autumn 2021, until they complete their studies. The guarantee means that these students will continue to be eligible for the same level of support as UK students, including access to student loans, grants and scholarships. This is a significant change from previous years, when EU students were only eligible for student loans for the first year of their studies. The extension of the funding guarantee is a welcome relief for many EU students, who were facing uncertainty about their future funding. One of those students is 22-year-old Eva from Spain, who is studying medicine at the University of Manchester. ""I was so worried about how I was going to afford to continue my studies after the first year,"" she says. ""But now I know that I will be able to complete my degree, thanks to this funding guarantee."" The funding guarantee is also a positive step for the UK higher education sector, which relies on EU students for a significant proportion of its income. In the 2020-21 academic year, there were over 140,000 EU students studying in the UK. These students contributed £2.6bn to the UK economy, according to Universities UK. The extension of the funding guarantee is a sign that the UK government is committed to supporting the higher education sector and ensuring that the UK remains an attractive destination for international students. However, some experts have warned that the funding guarantee could be undermined by the government's plans to introduce a new post-study work visa for international students. The new visa will allow international students to stay in the UK for two years after they graduate, to work or look for work. But it is not clear whether EU students will be eligible for the new visa, which could make it harder for them to remain in the UK after their studies. The government has said that it is still considering the eligibility criteria for the new visa, and that it will make an announcement in due course.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
General Election: Loyalists warn unionists not to vote Alliance,"By Mark Devenport BBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) was launched in 2015. In a statement, it said that ""any unionist who votes for the Alliance Party is driving a stake into the heart of unionism"". The LCC is an umbrella group representing loyalist paramilitary organisations. It said that the Alliance Party ""cannot be trusted"" and that ""they will never stand up for the interests of unionism"". The LCC's statement comes after the Alliance Party made gains in the recent local government elections. The Alliance Party is a centrist party that does not identify as either unionist or nationalist. It is the largest party on Belfast City Council and the second-largest party in Northern Ireland. The LCC's warning to unionists not to vote for the Alliance Party is a sign of the growing tensions between unionists and centrists in Northern Ireland. Unionists believe that the Alliance Party is a threat to their goal of maintaining Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom. Centrists, on the other hand, believe that the Alliance Party is the only party that can build a shared future for everyone in Northern Ireland. The LCC's statement is likely to further alienate centrists from unionism. It is also likely to make it more difficult for the Alliance Party to make further gains in the next Assembly election. The Assembly election is due to be held in May 2022. The LCC's statement is a reminder of the deep divisions that still exist in Northern Ireland. It is also a warning that the peace process is still fragile and that there is still a long way to go before Northern Ireland can truly be at peace.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid-19: Northamptonshire moves to tier 3,"The county, currently in tier two, will face the higher level of restrictions from 00:01 GMT on 26 December, the government has announced. People in tier three can form bubbles with another household on Christmas Day, but not stay overnight. They are also being urged not to travel to other parts of the UK unless it is for essential reasons. The move to tier three in Northamptonshire follows a rise in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks. The seven-day infection rate in the county is now 160.3 cases per 100,000 people, well above the England average of 127.5. The government said the decision to move Northamptonshire to tier three was made after taking into account a number of factors, including the number of cases, the rate of transmission, the number of hospital admissions and the capacity of the local NHS. The new restrictions in Northamptonshire will include: A ban on household mixing indoors, except for Christmas Day when one household can mix with one other household. A ban on meeting anyone outside your household in a private garden. A ban on meeting anyone outside your household in a public place, except for organised sports and exercise. A ban on travel between different parts of the UK, unless for essential reasons. The government said the restrictions would be reviewed every two weeks.

Gamer Hbomberguy hands funding row charity Donkey Kong boost,"YouTuber Hbomberguy made £265,000 by playing Nintendo 64's Donkey Kong live online after a proposed lottery grant for Mermaids was put under review.

Mermaids later accused Linehan of spreading ""anti-trans hate speech"", and Linehan has faced calls to be banned from Twitter. Hbomberguy, a vocal supporter of transgender rights, began livestreaming the Donkey Kong marathon in response to these events. He aimed to raise £1,000 for Mermaids but quickly surpassed that target. ""I usually just play games that I like and stream them. But this is a real situation that's impacting people's lives, and I wanted to do something to help,"" Hbomberguy told the BBC. ""I'm not a charity, but I have a platform, and I can use that to raise awareness and funds for Mermaids."" Hbomberguy's marathon lasted for over 57 hours, during which time he played Donkey Kong and responded to donations from viewers. The stream attracted over 500,000 viewers and raised a total of £265,000 for Mermaids. ""I'm so grateful to Hbomberguy and everyone who donated to this fundraiser,"" said Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids. ""This money will make a huge difference to our work supporting transgender children and their families."" The fundraiser has been praised by many in the gaming community, who have hailed Hbomberguy as a hero. However, some have criticized the fundraiser, arguing that it is unfair to target Linehan for his views.

Olympic Games £500k steam cloud artwork in Wirral delayed,"The £500,000 publicly funded spinning column of cloud was set to rise over the Wirral estuary from 31 December as part of the UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK project. However, strong winds have forced the postponement of the artwork by Liverpool-based artist,  Anthony McCall. The 200m-high column, titled Between the Ear and the Eye, will now take place at an alternative location on Thurstaton Common from 27-30 January. The relocation is due to safety concerns as high winds can affect the stability of the column. The 10-minute artwork is part of the UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK project, which is a government-funded initiative to bring large scale, free public artworks to towns and cities across the UK as part of the 2022 Festival. The artwork is meant to evoke the iconic image of the Olympic rings and will be visible from across the Mersey estuary. It will be made up of a series of spinning clouds of steam, creating a dynamic and ever-changing sculpture in the sky. The artist said: ""This new outdoor artwork is conceived specifically for the Wirral peninsula, Liverpool City Region and its communities. Through the transformative properties of steam, Between the Ear and the Eye, taps into our shared histories of invention, industry and migration in this area, while also looking towards the future. ""As you view the artwork from different vantage points, it presents multiple shifting and dynamic perspectives which both connect and divide the viewer from the work, and from each other."" The cloud column will be visible from the Wirral side of the estuary, as well as from Liverpool and parts of North Wales. It will be accompanied by a soundscape composed by Matthew Herbert.

Not guilty plea in landmark Kodi box trial,"By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter Mr Thompson is accused of selling ""fully loaded"" Kodi boxes, modified with software that allowed users to stream copyrighted content for free. The prosecution claims the boxes are illegal because they bypass copyright protections. But Mr Thompson's lawyer argued that the boxes are not illegal because they do not contain any copyrighted content themselves. He said users are responsible for what they stream on the boxes. The jury has been told that Mr Thompson sold more than 100,000 Kodi boxes. The trial is expected to last two weeks. Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. It allows users to play videos, music, and other digital media on a variety of devices. Kodi can be installed on computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. It is compatible with a wide range of file formats, including AVI, MP4, MKV, and WMV. Kodi can also be used to stream live TV and radio. In 2015, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) filed a lawsuit against the XBMC Foundation, alleging that Kodi was being used to facilitate copyright infringement. The MPAA argued that Kodi was being used to stream pirated movies and TV shows. The XBMC Foundation denies these allegations and argues that Kodi is a legitimate software application that can be used for a variety of purposes. The lawsuit is still pending. The trial of Mr Thompson is the first of its kind in the UK. It is unclear whether the outcome of the trial will have any impact on the use of Kodi in the UK.

Surrey Police investigation over 'misgendering' tweets,"Caroline Farrow said Surrey Police wants to ""conduct a taped interview under caution"" because of tweets posted in October.

In the October tweets, Ms Farrow said she was responding to ""what she believed was a series of tweets by a man"", who had previously been protected by an interim Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). The tweets that prompted the police investigation cannot be published for legal reasons. GRCs were introduced under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and allow transgender people to change their legal gender. However, Ms Farrow has previously argued that the 2004 Act allows ""male-bodied people to self-identify into the female sex and access women-only spaces, resources and opportunities."" Following the complaint about her October tweets, Surrey Police confirmed that the case was being investigated and a file had been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS subsequently decided not to press charges against Ms Farrow. Mark Burns-Williamson, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey, said the decision not to prosecute was ""wholly unsatisfactory"". He said the force had ""tried to do the right thing"" and had acted in ""good faith"". Surrey Police referred questions on its current investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC said it was ""assessing the available information to determine what further action may be required."" Ms Farrow, a former magistrate and journalist, stood unsuccessfully for the Brexit Party in the 2019 General Election. She has previously been a vocal critic of the Gender Recognition Act and has said she believes it ""undermines"" the rights of women. In a statement, she said she was ""appalled"" by the police investigation and accused Surrey Police of ""trying to silence"" her. ""I am a law-abiding citizen and I have done nothing wrong,"" she said. ""The police are wasting their time and resources on this investigation when they should be focusing on real crimes."" The investigation is the latest in a series of cases involving police investigations into alleged ""hate speech"" online. In 2020, a man was arrested for ""inciting hatred"" after he posted a tweet that was critical of transgender people. The case was later dropped, but it raised concerns about the potential for freedom of speech to be curtailed in the name of protecting minority groups.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wife of 39 years fails in divorce refusal appeal,"Tini Owens, 66, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling, which said she could not divorce her husband Hugh Owens, 78. But the appeal judges, led by Sir Geoffrey Vos, unanimously dismissed her challenge. They said the original judge had been right to conclude that the marriage had not irretrievably broken down and that it was possible for the couple to reconcile. Mrs Owens had argued that she could not reasonably be expected to live with her husband after 40 years of marriage, during which time she had been subjected to “coercive and controlling” behavior. She said Mr Owens had isolated her from her friends and family, had stopped her from working, and had made her feel like a “prisoner” in her own home. But the Court of Appeal judges said that Mrs Owens had not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims. They said that she had only made general allegations of controlling behavior and had not provided any specific examples. They also said that Mrs Owens had not shown that she had taken any steps to try to improve the situation, such as seeking help from a therapist or counselor. The judges said that it was clear that the couple had some difficulties in their relationship, but they said that these difficulties were not so serious that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. They said that it was possible for the couple to reconcile if they were willing to work on their relationship and seek help from a therapist or counselor. The judges also said that they were taking into account the fact that the couple had been married for a long time and had built up a life together. They said that it would be wrong to end the marriage without giving the couple a chance to try to reconcile. Mrs Owens said she was “disappointed” with the Court of Appeal's decision. She said she was determined to divorce her husband and would continue to fight for her freedom.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
North Korea: Mike Pompeo rejects 'gangster-like' accusation,"After two days of talks with senior officials, he said efforts to push Pyongyang towards abandoning nuclear weapons had international support. His comments were released in a statement, after Mr Pompeo left North Korea. ""As we work to implement the commitments from the Singapore summit, the US is committed, along with our allies in the region, to a brighter future for the Korean people on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. ""North Korea made clear to us that they understand the need to denuclearize,"" he added. ""We look forward to continuing these discussions in Singapore on 12th June."" However, analysts said that despite the talks, North Korea has not made any concrete commitment to scrap its nuclear arsenal. And some have said that the Trump administration is being too eager to trust Pyongyang's promises. Mr Pompeo's comments also come just two days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to pull out of his planned summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore next month. Mr Kim said he would not attend if the US tried to force him to give up his nuclear weapons. In response, Mr Trump said he was still confident that the summit would go ahead. He has also warned that he is ready to scrap the summit if he doesn't believe North Korea is serious about denuclearisation. The Singapore summit is the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. It is the culmination of months of diplomatic efforts to bring the two sides to the negotiating table. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome, including the issue of nuclear weapons. North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and missiles since the 1990s. It is thought to have up to 60 nuclear warheads, and is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US. The US has long considered North Korea's nuclear programme to be a threat to its security. It has imposed tough sanctions on the country, and has threatened military action if necessary.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UN net meeting 'hit by hackers' causing website disruption,"The World Conference on International Telecommunications (Wcit) is debating changes to a wide-ranging communications treaty. Delegates were unable to access material relating to the meeting after its website was forced offline. Hacker groups had claimed responsibility, organisers said. The UN's secretary general António Guterres addressed the summit on Monday from New York. He hailed the conference as a ""historic opportunity"" to establish a new era of global co-operation. ""We are living in a world awash with new technologies, which are changing our lives in ways we could scarcely have imagined,"" he said. ""But with these new technologies come new challenges, and new responsibilities."" Mr Guterres said the summit was an opportunity to establish a ""new global consensus"" on how to use technology for the benefit of all. The website for the conference was taken offline on Tuesday, the second day of the meeting. A spokesperson for the organisers said the website had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This type of attack involves flooding a website with so much traffic that it becomes inaccessible to users. A hacker group called Anonymous had claimed responsibility for the attack. The group said it was protesting against the proposed changes to the treaty, which it said would give governments too much control over the internet. The treaty in question is known as the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). It has been in place since 1988 and sets out the rules for how telecommunications networks are managed and operated. The proposed changes to the treaty would give governments more power to regulate the internet. This has raised concerns among some human rights groups, who say it could be used to censor online content. The World Conference on International Telecommunications is taking place in Dubai and is due to end on 16 December.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer',"Trial results coming out of a US cancer conference suggest the treatment works better than standard chemotherapy. Nivolumab significantly improved the survival odds of patients with these hard-to-treat tumours. Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and in the UK there are around 12,000 new cases every year. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and, until now, their prognosis has been very poor. Nivolumab is an immunotherapy drug and works by blocking a protein on the surface of immune cells called PD-1. This allows the immune system to recognise and attack the cancer cells. The CheckMate 141 trial involved nearly 400 patients with advanced head and neck cancer and compared nivolumab with standard chemotherapy. After a year, 36% of those treated with nivolumab were still alive, compared with 17% of those who received chemotherapy. Median overall survival improved from 10.7 months to 14.3 months. The treatment was also found to significantly reduce the risk of the disease progressing, or recurring. Dr Ursula Nestle, lead author, said: ""This is a practice-changing study because it is the first to show a significant improvement in overall survival for these hard-to-treat head and neck cancer patients."" Dr Nishant Agrawal, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, said: ""This is a game-changer. It changes the management and the approach to patients with head and neck cancer."" He said the treatment was particularly promising for those who are not able to receive standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. ""These are patients who are in pain, bleeding, and who have difficulty with eating and drinking,"" he said. The results of the study were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago. Nivolumab has not yet been approved by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), but Dr Nestle said she hoped this would change in the light of the new findings. She added: ""I don't think it will take long. The data are very compelling.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Further clashes over work on NI port controls,"In July, the UK government announced that it would delay the introduction of full checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK until October. The EU has said that it is willing to discuss changes to the protocol, but only within the limits of the existing agreement. The latest row comes after the UK government published a command paper setting out its plans for implementing the protocol. The paper said that the UK would introduce a ""grace period"" for checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, and that it would not implement checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. The EU has said that the UK's plans are not compatible with the protocol, and that it will take legal action if the UK does not implement the protocol in full. The UK government has said that it is committed to implementing the protocol, but that it needs to do so in a way that protects the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is a peace agreement that was signed in 1998 and ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The row over the protocol is the latest in a series of disputes between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and the two sides are still negotiating a trade agreement. The dispute over the protocol has raised concerns about the future of the Good Friday Agreement. The agreement is based on the principle of cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and some fear that the protocol could undermine this cooperation. The UK government has said that it is committed to the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will not do anything that could put it at risk. However, the EU has said that the UK's plans for implementing the protocol are not compatible with the agreement. The dispute over the protocol is a complex and difficult issue, and it is unclear how it will be resolved. However, it is clear that the issue has the potential to damage relations between the UK and the EU, and to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zika virus: 'Strongest evidence yet' of effect on babies,"Dr Tom Frieden, head of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), was testifying before politicians in Washington. He said that data from the cases of two infants in Brazil showed ""the strongest evidence yet"" that the Zika virus can cause brain damage in babies. The babies were born in Brazil and had severe brain defects. Their mothers had been infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy. Dr Frieden said that the data ""adds to the growing body of evidence that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of brain defects."" He said that the CDC is now recommending that pregnant women consider not traveling to areas where Zika virus is spreading. The CDC has also issued a travel warning for pregnant women to avoid areas where Zika virus is spreading. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the Zika virus. The virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which is also responsible for transmitting dengue fever and chikungunya. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Pregnant women should take extra precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in air-conditioned areas. If a pregnant woman is infected with the Zika virus, she should see her doctor immediately. The Zika virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Men who have traveled to areas where Zika virus is spreading should use condoms during sex with their pregnant partners. The Zika virus is a serious threat to pregnant women and their unborn babies. It is important to take steps to prevent infection and to seek medical care if you are infected.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

HS2 underground protest: Activists 'being forced out' of tunnel,"HS2 Rebellion, who are camped out at Euston Square Gardens, say the team is burrowing a vertical tunnel causing crumbs of earth to fall onto their camp. They say the noise and dust is making it very difficult to stay and that they are concerned about their safety. HS2 Ltd said it was aware of the concerns and that it was taking steps to minimise the impact of the work on the protesters. It said a ""dialogue"" was ongoing. The protesters have been camped out in the gardens since the end of August, in protest at the HS2 high-speed rail line. They say the line will cause environmental damage and that the government should be investing in public transport instead. In recent weeks, the protesters have been joined by Extinction Rebellion activists, who have been blocking roads and bridges in London in protest at the government's climate change policies. The HS2 project has been beset by delays and cost overruns. It was originally due to open in 2026, but is now not expected to be completed until 2034. The cost of the project has also risen from £56bn to £106bn. The government has said that HS2 is a vital infrastructure project that will boost the economy and create jobs. However, critics say that the project is too expensive and that the money would be better spent on other projects. The protests against HS2 have been ongoing for several years. In 2019, activists staged a series of demonstrations, including blocking the M4 motorway. In 2020, activists occupied a construction site in Buckinghamshire. The protests have led to a number of arrests and convictions. In 2020, nine activists were jailed for contempt of court after they refused to leave the construction site in Buckinghamshire. The government has said that it respects the right to protest, but that it will not tolerate illegal activity. It has also said that it is committed to HS2 and that the project will go ahead. The protests are likely to continue until the HS2 line is completed. The activists say they are determined to stop the project and that they will not give up until they have succeeded.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Bishop Peter Ball victim withdraws from church abuse review,"Peter Ball, 84, was jailed in October for offences against 18 teenagers and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. One of his victims, Rev Graham Sawyer, said he had taken the decision ""with great sadness"" after his requests for a role in shaping the review were rejected. ""I believe in Jesus and I love his church, but I can no longer be part of this particular institution,"" Sawyer said in a statement released by his lawyer. The Church of England announced last month that it would be holding an independent review into safeguarding failures that allowed Ball's abuse to continue undetected for decades. The review, to be led by retired High Court judge Sir David Calvert-Smith, will examine how the church responded to allegations against Ball and whether there were any systemic failings that allowed him to continue in his role. Sawyer said he had been ""deeply disappointed"" by the church's response to his request to be involved in the review. ""I had hoped that my experience and insights as a survivor of abuse within the church would be of value to the review,"" he said. ""However, it has become clear that the church is not willing to listen to the voices of survivors. This is a betrayal of trust and a missed opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past."" The Church of England said it understood Sawyer's decision and that it remained committed to listening to the voices of survivors. ""We deeply regret the pain and suffering that Graham Sawyer has experienced,"" a spokesperson said. ""We understand his decision to withdraw from the review and we will continue to work to ensure that the review is as comprehensive and independent as possible."" Ball was the Bishop of Lewes from 1977 to 1992 and the Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 to 2001. He was convicted of sexually abusing 18 teenagers and young men over a period of 20 years. His victims included young men who had been invited to stay at his home in Chichester and students at the theological college where he taught. Ball was sentenced to 32 months in prison in October 2015. He was released from prison in February 2017 after serving half of his sentence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Gareth Bayliss presents debut exhibition at Ipswich Art School,"Richard Haugh BBC News Bayliss, 35, studied at Ipswich Art School, which is now a gallery, before providing designs for clients including Dizzee Rascal, Mo Wax, Stussy and Habitat. Bayliss, who also teaches at Norwich University's College of Arts and Media, said he was excited to exhibit his artwork in the place where his creative journey began. ""It feels absolutely amazing to be able to showcase my work in this space. Coming back to the place where I studied, which has such a special place in my heart, and being able to share my creations with the people here is an honour,"" he said. The exhibition, titled ""Gareth Bayliss: Deconstructed,"" features a range of Bayliss's signature abstract works, known for their vibrant colours, bold shapes and intricate patterns. Bayliss draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including nature, music and personal experiences, which he then transforms into visually striking compositions. ""My work is all about expressing myself through colour and form. I want to create pieces that are visually stimulating and emotionally engaging for the viewer,"" he said. ""I'm particularly interested in the relationship between colour and shape, and how different combinations can evoke different feelings and sensations."" Bayliss's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications, and he has collaborated with a diverse range of artists and musicians. He is known for his innovative and experimental approach, and his work continues to push the boundaries of abstract art. The exhibition at Ipswich Art School is free to attend and will run until 26th March 2023.

Alstom: GE and French state agree to work on new offer,"France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg said that neither the GE bid, nor a joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer, met the government's demands. But the government had been presented with a new offer from GE and Alstom that he said provided ""real guarantees"". Montebourg said the government would now enter into exclusive negotiations with GE and Alstom, and that he hoped a final deal could be reached by the end of July. GE's initial offer for Alstom was worth €12.35bn (£10bn), while Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had offered €11.6bn. GE has since increased its offer to €12.4bn, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to satisfy the French government. The French government is keen to protect Alstom's independence, and has said it will not approve any deal that would see the company lose its status as a French champion. GE has said it is committed to maintaining Alstom's headquarters in France and its research and development centre in Belfort. However, the government is also concerned about the impact of the deal on employment. GE has said it will cut 6,500 jobs at Alstom, but the government wants to ensure that these cuts are limited to the company's overseas operations. The government is also concerned about the impact of the deal on Alstom's technology. GE has said it will invest €1bn in Alstom's research and development, but the government wants to ensure that this investment is used to develop new technologies in France. The negotiations between GE and the French government are expected to be tough, but both sides are keen to reach an agreement. GE needs Alstom to expand its presence in the global energy market, while the French government needs GE to invest in Alstom's technology and protect its independence. If a deal can be reached, it would be a major coup for GE and a major blow to Siemens. It would also be a significant victory for the French government, which has been determined to protect Alstom's independence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Covid: New lockdown needed, say Yorkshire leaders","Schools in England have shut to most pupils and people have been asked to stay at home under tighter rules. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said: ""We believe that a short, sharp, national lockdown is now necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to save lives."" He said that the current restrictions were not enough to stop the spread of the virus, and that a ""circuit break"" was needed to give the NHS time to recover. ""We know that a lockdown will be difficult for many people, but we believe it is the right thing to do to protect our communities,"" he said. The call for a lockdown has been echoed by other leaders in the region, including the Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin. She said: ""We are facing a very serious situation in Yorkshire and the Humber. The number of cases is rising rapidly and our hospitals are coming under increasing pressure. ""We need to take urgent action to prevent our NHS from being overwhelmed. A short, sharp lockdown is the best way to do this."" The leaders have written to the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, asking him to impose a national lockdown. A spokesperson for the government said that the Prime Minister was ""keeping all options on the table"" but that he was not currently planning to impose a national lockdown. However, the government has announced a number of new measures to try to slow the spread of the virus, including: Closing schools to most pupils Asking people to stay at home Banning gatherings of more than six people Making it compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and on public transport The government has also said that it will provide financial support to businesses that are affected by the new restrictions. The new measures have been welcomed by some, but others have expressed concern about the impact they will have on the economy and on people's mental health. It is not yet clear whether the new measures will be enough to stop the spread of the virus, and it is possible that the government will be forced to impose a national lockdown in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Bloodhound takes first drive across the desert,"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Pilot Andy Green took the jet-powered vehicle on a gentle 100mph (160km/h) shakedown test run on Friday. Bloodhound is in Northern Cape for high-speed trials as it works towards a world land speed record attempt of 1,000mph (1,600km/h) in 2023. Friday's run began with engineers simulating the conditions the car will experience when it's flat out at Mach 1.4. The team fired the rocket that will eventually provide most of the vehicle's thrust, but kept the rocket's throttle low to limit speeds. The vehicle then drove for 5km along a straight section of the 12-mile (19km) Hakskeen Pan track. It will now stay on the surface to have its data systems checked over the next 10 days. The Bloodhound car has been in development since 2008. Originally, the team behind the project hoped to break the 1,000mph barrier in 2015. But the effort has been beset by funding and technical setbacks. Bloodhound's shakedown run on Friday was conducted without driver Andy Green onboard. The aim of the exercise was to test the vehicle's systems, including its rocket and its parachute recovery system. Green will take the wheel for the first time on Monday. He will drive the car at progressively higher speeds, culminating in a 200mph (320km/h) run on Friday of next week. ""This is a fantastic moment for the team and a real milestone in the project,"" said Green. ""We're now one step closer to our goal of setting a new world land speed record."" The Bloodhound project is a privately funded venture that aims to push the boundaries of engineering and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. If successful, Bloodhound will become the first vehicle to break the 1,000mph barrier on land. The current record of 763mph (1,228km/h) was set by ThrustSSC in 1997.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Farm profits may halve after Brexit, says report","The report, by the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), says the ""worst-case scenario"" would cut average farm profits from £38,000 a year to just £18,000. The AHDB says this is because farmers will lose access to the EU's single market, which allows them to sell their products tariff-free. This will make it more expensive for them to export to the EU, which is their biggest market. The report also warns that farmers will face new costs from having to comply with new regulations and tariffs, which will further reduce their profits. The AHDB's report is based on a survey of 1,000 farmers. The survey found that 80% of farmers are concerned about the impact of Brexit on their businesses. The report has been welcomed by farming organisations, who say it highlights the need for the government to support farmers through Brexit. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the report was a ""wake-up call"" for the government. The NFU said the government needs to provide financial support to farmers and help them to prepare for Brexit. The government has said it is committed to supporting farmers through Brexit. The government has announced a £3 billion package of support for farmers, which includes funding for research and development, and grants to help farmers invest in new equipment. However, the NFU said the government's support package was not enough and that more needs to be done. The NFU said the government needs to do more to help farmers prepare for the new regulations and tariffs that will come into force after Brexit. The government has said it is working with farmers to help them prepare for Brexit. The government has set up a task force to help farmers with the new regulations and tariffs. The government has also said it is committed to maintaining the UK's high food safety and environmental standards after Brexit. The government has said it will not lower food standards in order to secure a trade deal with the EU.

Covid: Will Margaret Ferrier remain an MP after breaking rules?,"And the SNP has said if she does not stand down, the party will seek to have her expelled from the House of Commons. Ms Ferrier has said she is ""deeply sorry"" for her actions and has apologised to the people of Rutherglen and Hamilton West. She has also said that she will ""co-operate fully"" with the police investigation. The Metropolitan Police has said that it is investigating a ""potential offence"" under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. The regulations make it an offence for anyone to know that they have the virus and leave their home, or fail to self-isolate if they have been instructed to do so by a public health official. The maximum penalty for breaching the regulations is a £10,000 fine. Ms Ferrier is the first MP to be accused of breaking the coronavirus regulations. The case has raised questions about whether MPs should be subject to the same rules as everyone else. Some people have argued that MPs should be held to a higher standard, as they are public figures. Others have said that MPs should be treated the same as everyone else, and that it is up to the police to decide whether or not to investigate. The case is also likely to put pressure on the government to review the current coronavirus regulations. Some people have argued that the regulations are too strict and that they are having a disproportionate impact on people's lives. Others have said that the regulations are necessary to protect public health. The government has said that it is keeping the regulations under review and that it will make changes if necessary.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UKIP make their mark in Scotland,"Brian Taylor Political editor, Scotland So, quite deliberately, I grabbed the chance today to offer my congratulations to each of Scotland's elected MEPs among the throng gathered in Edinburgh City Chambers for the final declaration. And commiseration. After an election which, in many ways, was a bit of a damp squib, there was a palpable sense of anti-climax as the formal announcement was made of the 6 MEPs elected to represent Scotland in the European Parliament. Only 35% of the electorate voted. That's a record low. And, as a consequence, Nigel Farage's UKIP now has its first MEPs in Scotland. Two of them - David Coburn and David McHugh. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall believes this is the start of something big north of the border. ""This is the thin end of the wedge. We know from our polls, from our membership numbers, this thing is growing and growing. And that's what people need to be aware of."" There was, of course, no formal election night celebration planned by UKIP in Scotland last night. But at a city centre bar, there was a gathering of supporters and elected representatives - including Mr Coburn. In an interview with me, he said the election of two UKIP MEPs to Strasbourg was: ""A kick in the teeth for the establishment."" ""It proves that the status quo is not good enough,"" he said. ""People want change and they want it now."" So what of the other parties? Labour remain Scotland's largest party in the parliament, despite losing one of their previous three seats. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was keen to point out that his party secured nearly twice as many votes as UKIP. ""We topped the poll in Scotland, the Labour Party. And I'm very proud of that."" The SNP also lost one of their previous two seats. They now have two MEPs, including 19-year-old Alyn Smith, the youngest politician ever to be elected to the European Parliament. He said the SNP's ""positive"" and ""optimistic"" message was what attracted voters to their party. ""We showed that, even in this referendum Parliament, that we are the most positive, optimistic party in Scotland."" Ruth Davidson's Conservatives secured one seat and there was also one seat for the Liberal Democrats. Catherine Stihler topped the poll for her party, just as she did 5 years ago. She said the result was ""a difficult night"" for her party across the UK but she was pleased to win a seat for the Lib Dems in Scotland. So, UKIP has made its mark in Scotland, albeit on a relatively low turnout. The challenge for the party now is to build on what they have achieved and become a more significant player on the Scottish political stage. As for the other parties, they will be looking to the future and with the next Scottish parliament election in 2 years, they will need to ensure they are ready to challenge the SNP's dominance of Scottish politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zero waste society plans for Scotland unveiled,"Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said it was time to tackle nearly 20m tonnes of waste currently produced by Scotland every year. The zero waste plan includes: A ban on sending biodegradable waste to landfill by 2021. A 70% recycling target by 2025. A deposit return scheme for drinks containers. A ban on microbeads in cosmetics. The Scottish Government will also invest £70m in new recycling infrastructure. The plans have been welcomed by environmental groups. ""This is a bold and ambitious plan that has the potential to make Scotland a world leader in waste reduction,"" said Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. ""The Scottish Government has listened to the public and is taking action to tackle the growing problem of waste."" The Scottish Conservatives have also welcomed the plans, but have called for the government to go further. ""We need to see more detail on how these plans will be implemented and funded,"" said Murdo Fraser, the party's environment spokesman. ""We also need to see a stronger focus on reducing waste at source."" Zero waste is a term used to describe a society that produces little or no waste. This can be achieved through a combination of measures, such as: Reducing consumption. Reusing items. Recycling materials. Composting organic waste. Zero waste societies are often more sustainable than traditional societies, as they reduce the amount of pollution and greenhouse gases produced. They can also be more resilient, as they are less reliant on finite resources. The Scottish Government's zero waste plan is a significant step towards creating a more sustainable Scotland. If successful, it will help to reduce the country's environmental impact and create a more resilient society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The East Cardiff area covers Splott, Tremorfa and Adamsdown. The proposals here focus on ""enhancing and improving local services"" by delivering new homes, employment and leisure opportunities. The North Cardiff area includes Cathays, Roath and Gabalfa. The council wants to create a ""vibrant health innovation district"" around Cardiff University's new £300m innovation campus at the former Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The West Cardiff area covers Grangetown, Riverside and Cardiff Bay. The proposals include the potential for new homes, a new school and improvements to public spaces. The council said the new ideas would ""build on the momentum"" of recent regeneration projects in the city, including the Central Square development, the redevelopment of Cardiff Market and the opening of the new Cardiff Bus Interchange. It added that the plans would help to ""create a more vibrant, sustainable and inclusive city"" and would ""support the city's economy and create jobs"". The consultation is open until 12 December. Cllr Russell Goodway, Cardiff council's cabinet member for investment and development, said: ""We are committed to making Cardiff a better place to live, work and visit. ""These proposals are ambitious, but they are also achievable. We believe that by working together with our partners and the people of Cardiff, we can create a city that we can all be proud of.""

Kashmir uproar over Afzal Guru clemency plea,"By Mehboob Khan BBC News A resolution had been tabled on the case of Afzal Guru, who was convicted over the 2001 India parliament attack. Sheikh said that ""the real culprits behind the attack are still at large,"" suggesting that the supreme court had ""hastened"" Guru's execution three years ago and that the Afzal Guru family had been ""denied justice."" The government in New Delhi has not commented on the resolution, but the speaker of the state assembly, Kavinder Gupta, adjourned the proceedings until next week. Guru was sentenced to death in 2002 for his role in the attack on India's parliament in 2001. He was hanged in Delhi's Tihar jail in February 2013, aged 43. Guru's family and supporters long maintained that the trial was unfair and that he was made a scapegoat. They argue that Afzal Guru was not present at the time of the attack and that the evidence against him was fabricated . The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly is the latest sign of growing support for Guru's family and campaigners who believe he was wrongly executed. The attack on the Indian parliament on 13 December 2001 left 14 people dead, including five attackers. The attack was blamed on Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. The neighbours have been locked in a bitter territorial dispute over the Himalayan region since then. Pakistan denies any involvement in the parliament attack, but India says it has ""incontrovertible evidence"" of Islamabad's involvement. The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly has been welcomed by the Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of separatist leaders in Kashmir. The conference said that the resolution ""vindicates our stand that Afzal Guru was innocent and his execution was a travesty of justice. The resolution is also likely to raise tensions between India and Pakistan. India has already accused Pakistan of interfering in its internal affairs. The Indian government has said that it will not tolerate any interference in its internal affairs and that it will take all necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and integrity. The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly is a significant development. It is the first time that a state assembly in India has passed a resolution calling for the reopening of the Afzal Guru case.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Robin Gibb: Bee Gees singer's funeral held in Thame,"Hundreds of fans lined the streets of Thame earlier as a lone bagpiper led a procession through the town. Gibb's body was carried in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by two Irish wolfhounds and guests, including his brother Barry and his son Adam. The service was held at St Mary's Church, where Gibb was a regular worshipper. It was a private ceremony, but fans were able to watch the procession and listen to the service on loudspeakers outside the church. Gibb's widow, Dwina, gave a reading during the service, and his son Robin-John performed a song. Gibb's brother Barry also spoke, paying tribute to his brother's ""unique talent"" and ""warm heart."" After the service, Gibb's body was taken to the town cemetery for a private burial. Gibb, who was 62, died on May 20 after a long battle with cancer. He was a member of the Bee Gees, one of the most successful pop groups of all time. The group sold over 200 million records worldwide and had a string of hits, including ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""How Deep Is Your Love,"" and ""Night Fever."" Gibb was born on the Isle of Man in 1949. He moved to Australia with his family when he was a child, and the Bee Gees were formed in 1958. The group moved to England in the early 1960s, and their career took off after they were discovered by Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles. The Bee Gees had their first major hit in 1967 with the song ""Massachusetts."" They went on to have a string of hits in the 1970s, including ""Stayin' Alive,"" which was featured in the film ""Saturday Night Fever."" Gibb was also a successful solo artist. He released a number of albums, including ""Robin's Reign"" (1983) and ""Secret Agent"" (1984). Gibb was diagnosed with cancer in 2010. He underwent treatment, but the cancer returned in 2012. Gibb died on May 20, 2012, at the age of 62. Gibb was a talented singer, songwriter, and musician. He was a member of one of the most successful pop groups of all time.

More than one in 10 providing unpaid care,"Figures from 2011 show that the largest increase was in unpaid carers working for 50 or more hours a week. Their numbers rose by 14% to more than 500,000, accounting for 14% of all unpaid carers. The number of people providing unpaid care for more than 20 hours a week also increased - up by 200,000 since 2001 to 2.1 million. Those providing unpaid care for more than 50 hours a week were more likely to be female (64%), and the majority were aged between 45 and 64. The increase in the number of people providing unpaid care is thought to be due to a number of factors, including the growing number of older people, and the increasing prevalence of long-term conditions such as dementia. The unpaid care provided by these individuals is essential to the UK economy, saving the government billions of pounds each year. However, it can also have a significant impact on the health and well-being of carers. Those providing unpaid care are more likely to experience physical health problems, mental health problems, and financial difficulties. They are also more likely to give up work or reduce their working hours, which can lead to a loss of income and career progression. The government has been criticized for not doing enough to support unpaid carers. There have been calls for increased financial support, more respite care and better access to health and social care services. In 2016, the government announced a new Carers' Allowance of £62.70 a week for those providing unpaid care for at least 35 hours a week. However, this is only available to those who are not in receipt of certain other benefits, and it is not enough to cover the costs of caring for someone full-time. There are a number of organizations that provide support and advice to unpaid carers, including Carers UK, Age UK, and the Alzheimer's Society. These organizations can provide information about benefits, respite care, and other services available to carers. They can also offer emotional support and practical help, such as organizing support groups and providing training for carers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians?,"Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians? By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics Editor Talks aimed at resolving the political deadlock continue at Stormont. The talks are focusing on welfare reform, finance, paramilitary activity, language, and culture. Welfare reform is a major issue for the DUP, which wants to see the introduction of a universal credit system in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, is opposed to welfare reform, arguing that it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society. Finance is another key issue. The DUP wants to see a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see more investment in public services. Paramilitary activity is also a major concern. The DUP wants to see an end to paramilitary activity, while Sinn Féin wants to see a process of demilitarization. Language and culture are also sensitive issues. The DUP wants to see the promotion of British identity in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see the promotion of Irish identity. These are just some of the thorny issues that the Stormont talks will need to address. If a deal can be reached, it will be a major breakthrough. However, if the talks fail, it will be a major setback for the peace process in Northern Ireland. Welfare reform Welfare reform is a major issue for the DUP, which wants to see the introduction of a universal credit system in Northern Ireland. Universal credit is a single payment that replaces six existing benefits. The DUP argues that universal credit will simplify the welfare system and make it fairer. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, is opposed to welfare reform, arguing that it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society. Sinn Féin says that universal credit will lead to cuts in benefits and that it will make it more difficult for people to claim benefits. Finance Finance is another key issue. The DUP wants to see a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland. Corporation tax is a tax on the profits of companies. The DUP argues that a reduction in corporation tax would make Northern Ireland more attractive to businesses and would create jobs. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, wants to see more investment in public services. Sinn Féin says that public services are essential for the well-being of society and that they should be properly funded. Paramilitary activity Paramilitary activity is also a major concern. The DUP wants to see an end to paramilitary activity, while Sinn Féin wants to see a process of demilitarization. The DUP argues that paramilitary activity is a threat to the peace process and that it needs to be stopped. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, argues that paramilitaries are a legitimate part of the republican struggle and that they will only disarm when there is a united Ireland. Language and culture Language and culture are also sensitive issues. The DUP wants to see the promotion of British identity in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see the promotion of Irish identity. The DUP argues that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and that British identity should be promoted. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, argues that Northern Ireland is a distinct entity with its own unique culture and identity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning,"Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning The UK's largest building firm said it expected a shortfall in its UK construction unit, meaning 2014 group pre-tax profits would be ""significantly lower"" than expected. Balfour said group revenue for 2014 was about £8bn - up 12% on the previous year. However, it had been hit by ""unforeseen losses"" at its UK construction business, the group said. Chief executive Andrew McNaughton said: ""Today's results are not acceptable and we have immediately begun a comprehensive review of our UK construction business. ""In the meantime we will continue to focus on our international operations and other strong parts of the group to ensure we deliver on our commitments to clients, employees and shareholders."" Shares in the firm fell by 14% on Monday morning. Balfour Beatty has been in talks with its banks about its financial position. It said it was also considering job cuts as it seeks to cut costs. Analysts said the profit warning was a ""big blow"" to Balfour Beatty. ""The company has been struggling for some time and this is another setback,"" said Liberum analyst Joe Brent. ""The UK construction market is tough and Balfour Beatty is not the only company to be struggling. But this is still a big blow."" Balfour Beatty is one of the UK's largest construction companies. It is best known for building Heathrow Terminal 5, the new Wembley Stadium and Terminal 2 at London's Gatwick Airport. The company has been hit by a number of problems in recent years, including a dispute over a school building project in Edinburgh and delays to a major rail project in the Midlands. In 2013, Balfour Beatty announced plans to cut 500 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive. The company's share price has fallen by more than 50% in the past year.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sea lice and disease behind Marine Harvest bid to save £44m,"By Douglas Fraser Business/economy editor, Scotland In Scotland, the company plunged to a 4.5m euro (£4m) loss in the final three months of 2019. It blamed the outbreak of a parasite and a virus, which led to 4.8 million fish dying last year. The loss was the first for Marine Harvest in Scotland since 2009. The company said it would cut jobs and reduce the amount of antibiotics it uses. The outbreak of sea lice, which are small crustaceans that can attach themselves to fish, was the main factor behind the losses. The company had to transfer fish to other sites to try to control the spread of the parasite. The virus, which causes a disease called infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), was also a major problem. ISA is a highly contagious disease that can kill up to 80% of farmed salmon. The losses have led Marine Harvest to announce a £44m investment plan to try to improve the health of its fish. The plan includes the installation of new equipment to control sea lice and the use of new vaccines to protect fish from ISA. The company also said it would cut the number of fish it farms in Scotland by 10%. This will reduce the pressure on the environment and help to control the spread of disease. Marine Harvest is the world's largest salmon farmer. It has been operating in Scotland for more than 30 years and employs around 1,300 people. The company's losses have raised concerns about the future of the Scottish salmon farming industry. The industry is worth around £2bn a year and employs around 12,000 people. However, the industry has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, including rising costs and competition from other countries. The outbreak of sea lice and ISA has added to these challenges. The Scottish government has said it is committed to supporting the salmon farming industry. The government has provided funding for research into sea lice and ISA and has introduced new regulations to try to control the spread of disease. However, the industry is still facing a number of challenges and it is unclear whether Marine Harvest's investment plan will be enough to save the company from further losses.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Myanmar coup: India asked to return police officers who crossed border,"Indian officials said the officers and their families had crossed the border in recent days. In a letter, Myanmar authorities asked for their return ""in order to uphold friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries"". The development follows last month's coup in Myanmar, which has been widely condemned by the international community. The military has detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other top officials, and has imposed martial law in parts of the country. The Indian government has not yet responded to Myanmar's request, but it is facing pressure from both within India and from the international community to take action. Some Indian lawmakers have called on the government to grant asylum to the police officers and their families, while others have said that they should be returned to Myanmar. The United States and the United Kingdom have both called on India to respect the rule of law and to uphold its international obligations. The situation is a delicate one for India, which has close ties to both Myanmar and the United States. India has been a major supporter of Myanmar's democratic transition, but it is also concerned about the stability of the country, which shares a long border with India. India is also facing pressure from China, which has backed the military coup in Myanmar. China has significant economic and strategic interests in Myanmar, and it is likely to try to influence India's response to the crisis. The Indian government is likely to take its time in deciding how to respond to Myanmar's request. It will need to weigh the various factors involved, including the domestic political situation, its relations with Myanmar and the United States, and the potential for regional instability. Whatever decision India makes, it is likely to have a significant impact on the future of Myanmar and the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Chagos legal status sent to international court by UN,"The UN General Assembly voted by 94 countries to 15 that The Hague should examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands. The former British colony was a naval base and home to 1,500 people before they were forced out in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for an American military base on the main island of Diego Garcia. The UK maintains that the islands have always been part of British territory and that the islanders were not permanent residents. Mauritius argues that the islands were part of its territory when it gained independence from Britain in 1968 and that the islanders were forcibly removed. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will now consider whether the Chagos Islands were legally separated from Mauritius in 1965 and whether the UK has an obligation to return them. The UK government has said that it will not abide by the ICJ's ruling if it goes against the UK's position. The US government has also said that it will not withdraw its military base from Diego Garcia. The Chagossians, who now live in Mauritius, the UK, and the Seychelles, have welcomed the decision to refer the case to the ICJ. They hope that the court will rule in their favor and that they will be able to return home. The Chagos Islands dispute is a complex and long-running issue. The ICJ's ruling could have a significant impact on the future of the islands and their people. In addition to the legal arguments, the case also involves issues of human rights and self-determination. The Chagossians were forcibly removed from their homes and have been living in exile for decades. They have been denied the right to return to their homeland and have been subjected to discrimination and abuse. The ICJ's ruling could help to address these human rights concerns and could contribute to the resolution of the Chagos Islands dispute.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid: Moray moving to level two 'hugely welcome',"The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate. However it has dropped in recent days, to under 40 cases per 100,000 people - below the level two threshold. The move means that pubs and restaurants will be able to serve alcohol indoors until 10pm, and up to eight people from four households can meet in homes and gardens. Moray's MSP, Richard Lochhead, said the move was ""hugely welcome"" news for businesses and residents. He said: ""This is a result of the hard work and sacrifices made by people across Moray in recent weeks. ""It's important to remember that the virus is still here, so we must all continue to follow the guidance and protect each other."" Moray Council's leader, Graham Leadbitter, said the move was a ""significant step forward"" for the region.

""We must not become complacent, however, and we must all continue to play our part in protecting ourselves and others."" The Scottish government's national clinical director, Jason Leitch, said the decision to move Moray to level two was made following a ""careful assessment"" of the data.

Microsoft seeks to clean up Xbox game chat with AI,"It is introducing customisable filters that let gamers choose the vocabulary they see in messages from friends and rival players. The four levels of filtering range from child-friendly through to entirely unfiltered.  The new feature builds on Microsoft’s existing approach to Xbox chat moderation, which saw it remove 2.3 million abusive messages between July and September last year, and take action on more than 4.6 million accounts.  Xbox’s new chat filter arrives at a time when online toxicity is becoming an increasingly prominent issue, with many games suffering from severe levels of harassment and abuse. The problem has become so bad in some titles that players have started to boycott matches if they involve certain maps or game modes, due to the fear of encountering particularly nasty opponents.  In one of the most notorious recent examples, Valve was forced to remove a popular community-created map from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive after it emerged that the map’s creator had left a series of racist easter eggs hidden within it.  Microsoft is at least one of several major players in the games industry attempting to tackle the problem, with Sony and Nintendo also taking steps to reduce toxicity on their own platforms. In November last year, Sony rolled out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that allowed players to mute messages from specific individuals or groups, while Nintendo has been working with researchers at Kyoto University to develop an AI capable of detecting and filtering out abusive messages in real time.  However, despite the efforts of major platform holders, online toxicity remains a significant problem in gaming. There have been particular concerns expressed about its impact on marginalised groups, such as women and players from minority backgrounds.  In theory, customisable chat filters – especially ones that give players the option of completely disabling text communication – could offer an effective way to address these concerns. However, they also raise the potential for players to abuse the system by blocking legitimate criticism or commentary.  Microsoft is hoping to strike a balance between protecting players from abuse and giving them the freedom to have unfiltered discussions with friends. Whether or not it succeeds will likely depend on how well the new chat filters are implemented and enforced.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Merged Isle of Wight prison criticised in report,"An inspection of HMP Isle of Wight found ""degrading"" sanitation provision, high use of force and inmates seeking sanctuary in a segregation unit. Inspectors from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) said there was ""a failure to provide decent, safe living conditions for prisoners"". The report, published on Thursday, said the prison was ""struggling to cope"" with the merger of two institutions in 2013, which created a ""volatile"" environment. The IMB said the prison was ""still finding its feet"" after the merger and that the process had been ""difficult and disruptive"". One of the most concerning findings was the ""degrading"" state of the toilets and showers. Inspectors said that prisoners were often forced to queue for long periods of time to use the facilities, and that the showers were often cold or broken. In some cases, prisoners were forced to share toilets with up to 20 other inmates. The report also found that the use of force by staff was ""unnecessarily high"". Inspectors said that they had witnessed staff using excessive force on prisoners, including punching, kicking and headlocks. In one case, an inmate was left with a broken jaw after being restrained by staff. The IMB said that the high use of force was ""a symptom of the wider problems"" at the prison, including overcrowding, understaffing and a lack of training. The report also found that inmates were increasingly seeking sanctuary in the segregation unit, which is supposed to be used for prisoners who are at risk of harming themselves or others. However, inspectors said that the segregation unit was often being used as a ""dumping ground"" for prisoners who were difficult to manage. The IMB said that the prison needed to ""take urgent action"" to address the problems identified in the report. The board's chairman, Richard Garside, said that the prison was ""failing to provide a decent and safe environment for prisoners"". He said that the problems at the prison were ""a matter of concern"" and that the government needed to take action to address them. In response to the report, the Ministry of Justice said that it was ""committed to improving conditions at HMP Isle of Wight"".

Fears raised 'free NHS' will come to an end,"Nearly half of the 78 health and care leaders surveyed by the Nuffield Trust felt the status quo is collapsing. A third believe it is beyond repair and has already entered a terminal decline. The NHS is one of the UK's most cherished institutions, but it is facing a number of challenges, including a rising population, an aging population, and increasing demand for services. In recent years, there have been growing concerns that the NHS is no longer able to provide the level of care that patients expect. Waiting times for appointments and treatment have increased, and some patients have been forced to wait for months or even years for essential care. The Nuffield Trust survey found that many health and care leaders believe that the NHS is in a state of decline. They cite a number of factors, including the rising cost of care, the shortage of staff, and the increasing complexity of patient needs. The survey also found that many health and care leaders are concerned about the future of the NHS. They believe that the NHS is not sustainable in its current form and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The Nuffield Trust survey is a wake-up call for the government. It is clear that the NHS is facing a number of challenges and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The government has said that it is committed to the NHS and that it will provide the funding and support that it needs. However, it is clear that the NHS is facing a number of challenges and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The government must now work with health and care leaders to develop a plan for the future of the NHS. This plan must be based on the evidence and it must be sustainable in the long term.

Being a couch potato could be genetic say Aberdeen scientists,"Scientists from Aberdeen University, working with colleagues in China, have been looking at why some people are less inclined to exercise and more likely to put on weight. The team said they had found a ""substantial genetic basis"" for a sedentary lifestyle. The research, published in the journal Obesity, analysed genetic data from almost 400,000 people and found 148 regions of the human genome which were linked to physical activity. The study also looked at whether genes were linked to adiposity or fatness. Researchers say they identified approximately 400 genetic areas associated with obesity or adiposity. It was found that physical inactivity and fatness tended to share some genetic causes. Some of the genes associated with physical inactivity were found to be linked to depression and schizophrenia. The Aberdeen team say they believe that when combined with data on other factors, such as diet and environment, the genetic insights could be used to better predict the likelihood of a person being less active. ""In terms of identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of being inactive and obese, then knowing something about their genetic predisposition would allow interventions to be implemented at a younger age,"" said Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, one of the authors of the paper. ""In large-scale population studies, the genetic data gathered from each individual could be used to calculate a risk score for inactivity and obesity. This score could then be used to target resources to those more likely to benefit from an intervention."" The team also believe that learning more about the genetic causes of physical inactivity could help in the development of new drugs designed to overcome the lack of motivation to exercise. ""Physical inactivity remains one of the most pressing public health concerns of the 21st century,"" said Professor Stamatakis. ""Overcoming physical inactivity is a complex issue as it is influenced by a wide range of factors, including genetic, physiological, psychological, environmental, and socio-economic determinants.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Poster wars breaking out across Europe,"In Britain, the UK Independence Party has certainly got the publicity it was hoping for from its new anti-immigration posters. They have been widely condemned, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling them ""divisive and offensive"". But the party's leader, Nigel Farage, has defended them, saying they are ""a wake-up call"" about the dangers of mass immigration. The posters, which feature an image of a long queue of people outside a job centre, with the slogan ""Breaking Point: The EU has failed us"", have been placed on billboards across the country. They have sparked a furious debate about immigration, with some people supporting the message while others have condemned it as racist. The row over the posters has also spread to other European countries. In Germany, the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) has put up posters that show a Muslim woman in a burka with the slogan ""Stop Islamisation"". The posters have been widely condemned by politicians and community leaders, who say they are Islamophobic. In France, the far-right National Front party has put up posters that show a picture of a black man with the slogan ""No to immigration"". The posters have also been widely condemned, with many people saying that they are racist. The rise of anti-immigration rhetoric across Europe is a worrying trend. It is a sign that far-right parties are gaining ground and that they are exploiting people's fears about immigration. This is a dangerous development that could lead to social unrest and even violence. It is important to remember that immigration is a complex issue with no easy answers. It is important to have a balanced debate about immigration, and to focus on the facts rather than on fear and prejudice. One of the most important facts about immigration is that it is not a threat to our way of life. In fact, immigrants often make a positive contribution to our economy and our society. They bring new skills and talents, and they help to create new businesses and jobs. It is also important to remember that immigration is a human issue. Behind every statistic, there is a person with a story to tell. We need to remember that immigrants are people just like us, and that they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The CMA's investigation found that Viagogo had broken the law by: Failing to provide accurate information about the tickets it sells, including the price, the location of the seats, and the availability of tickets. Charging hidden fees that were not clearly disclosed to customers. Making it difficult for customers to get a refund if they could not attend an event. The CMA's order requires Viagogo to: Provide clear and accurate information about the tickets it sells. Disclose all fees and charges to customers upfront. Make it easier for customers to get a refund if they cannot attend an event. The CMA's action against Viagogo is part of a wider crackdown on the secondary ticketing market. In 2018, the government introduced new legislation to regulate the secondary ticketing market. The legislation gives the CMA powers to investigate and take enforcement action against ticket sellers who break the law. The CMA has also been working with other regulators in Europe to tackle the issue of online ticket touts. In 2019, the CMA and the European Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on the enforcement of consumer protection law in the secondary ticketing market. The CMA's action against Viagogo is a significant step towards ensuring that the secondary ticketing market is fair and transparent for consumers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

NHS contaminated blood scandal victims urged to come forward,"Thousands of people were infected with HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood after blood transfusions and other treatments. After 30 years of repeated calls, Parliament will announce the terms of reference for the public inquiry. The inquiry will investigate how the infections happened, why they were not discovered sooner, and what lessons can be learned to prevent similar tragedies in the future. It will also consider the impact on the victims and their families, and whether they have received adequate support. The announcement of the inquiry is a major victory for campaigners who have been fighting for justice for decades. They say that the victims have been let down by the government and the NHS, and that the inquiry is long overdue. Jason Evans, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said: ""This is a historic day for people affected by the contaminated blood scandal. For 30 years, they have been fighting for truth and justice, and today's announcement is a major step forward."" Sue Threakall, co-founder of the Campaign for Contaminated Blood Justice, said: ""This is a day we have been waiting for for a long time. We are delighted that the government has finally agreed to hold a public inquiry, and we will continue to fight for justice for all those affected by this scandal."" The inquiry is expected to take several years to complete. It will be led by a panel of independent experts, and will hear evidence from victims, their families, and healthcare professionals. The government has said that it is committed to learning the lessons from the contaminated blood scandal, and that it will take action to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. In addition to the public inquiry, the government has also announced a compensation scheme for victims of the scandal. The scheme will provide payments to those who were infected with HIV or hepatitis C, and to their families. The compensation scheme is a welcome step forward, but campaigners say that it does not go far enough. They say that the government should also provide long-term support for victims, including access to healthcare and financial assistance. The contaminated blood scandal is one of the biggest medical scandals in British history. It is a tragedy that has caused immeasurable suffering for thousands of people. The public inquiry is a vital step towards ensuring that the victims get the justice they deserve.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Julia Gillard grilled on Rudd ousting 'victory speech',"Ms Gillard, who took office in June 2010, had said she took the decision to challenge Mr Rudd on the day itself. But an ABC news programme suggested that preparations for a leadership challenge had already begun weeks earlier. On 24 June 2010, Gillard called a press conference to announce that she would challenge Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party. In her speech, Gillard said that she had made the decision to challenge Rudd that day, and that she believed that she was the best person to lead the party and the country. However, an ABC news programme on 26 June 2010, reported that Gillard had begun making preparations for a leadership challenge several weeks earlier. The program reported that Gillard had met with several senior Labor figures in the weeks leading up to the challenge, and that she had discussed the possibility of challenging Rudd with them. The report also said that Gillard had sought advice from former Prime Minister Bob Hawke on how to challenge a sitting Prime Minister. Hawke had been successful in challenging Bill Hayden for the leadership of the Labor Party in 1983. The report suggested that Gillard's decision to challenge Rudd had been planned in advance, and that she had been preparing for the challenge for several weeks. Gillard denied the allegations, saying that she had only made the decision to challenge Rudd on the day itself. The ABC report has raised questions about Gillard's version of events. If the report is accurate, it suggests that Gillard was not as spontaneous in her decision to challenge Rudd as she has claimed. It also suggests that Gillard may have been planning the challenge for some time, and that she may have been disloyal to Rudd. The allegations against Gillard have damaged her reputation, and they have raised questions about her leadership. Gillard has denied the allegations, but they have cast a shadow over her time as Prime Minister.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Search under way for monkeys missing from Belfast zoo,"Six lion-tailed macaques managed to get out on Monday - four have since been returned. The other two monkeys have been seen in the grounds or near the zoo. Belfast zoo said it was working with the PSNI and Belfast City Council to try and locate the remaining animals. The search continues. The lion-tailed macaques are part of a group of six that arrived at Belfast Zoo in April 2022 from Germany. They are an endangered species, native to the Western Ghats of India. In the wild, lion-tailed macaques live in social groups of up to 50 individuals, and they are known for their long tails and black fur. One of the missing monkeys, a female, was spotted on Wednesday morning in the grounds of Belfast Zoo. The other missing monkey, a male, was last seen on Monday evening near the zoo. Belfast Zoo staff are asking members of the public to keep an eye out for the missing monkeys and to report any sightings to the zoo. The zoo is also asking people not to approach the monkeys, as they may be frightened or aggressive. Lion-tailed macaques are not native to the UK, and they are not considered to be a danger to the public. However, they are wild animals, and they can be unpredictable. If you see one of the missing monkeys, please do not approach it. Instead, please call the Belfast Zoo on 028 9077 6277. The PSNI is also asking members of the public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity in the area around the zoo. The search for the missing monkeys is ongoing, and the zoo is hopeful that they will be found safe and well.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: UK foreign aid spending cut by £2.9bn amid economic downturn,"It said a review of aid projects has prioritised the most vulnerable countries for assistance. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would still meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on international development. He added: ""The UK will remain a world-leading donor and continue to tackle extreme poverty, help the world's most vulnerable people, fight disease and tackle climate change, and respond to humanitarian emergencies around the world."" The decision has been criticised by some aid agencies, who say it will have a ""devastating"" impact on the world's poorest people. Oxfam's head of UK government relations, Ruth Tanner, said: ""This is a devastating blow to the world's poorest people. It will cost lives, push people deeper into poverty and undermine years of progress."" Save the Children UK's chief executive, Kevin Watkins, said: ""The UK government has made a shameful decision to cut foreign aid at a time when the global community needs it more than ever. This cut will hit the world's poorest and most vulnerable people the hardest, costing lives and pushing millions more into poverty."" The UK government has defended the decision, saying it is necessary to ""balance the books"" after the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. International Development Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ""We recognise the vital role that UK aid plays in helping to lift people out of poverty and providing essential support in humanitarian crises."" She added: ""However, we must balance this with our own fiscal responsibilities and the need to reduce the UK's borrowing. We will continue to deliver our aid commitments in the most effective and efficient way possible."" The decision will see the UK's aid budget fall to £12.2bn in 2021-22, from £15.1bn in 2020-21.

Rooney mania grips Tanzania as Everton play Gor Mahia,"Rooney had the first touch of the game between Everton and Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia, in front of the largest crowd ever seen at the National Stadium in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. This was a pre-season friendly match, and Rooney's introduction to the proceedings was met with a huge roar and applause by the fervent Tanzanian crowd. The former England international is used to such adulation, but the outpouring of affection for him in this East African nation was something else. Rooney's every touch of the ball was greeted with cheers, and the crowd even chanted his name throughout the game. The 33-year-old forward responded with a lively performance, creating several chances for his team-mates and scoring a stunning goal from a free-kick. Everton manager Marco Silva was delighted with Rooney's performance, saying: ""He's a world-class player, and he showed his quality today. He's still got a lot to offer, and I'm sure he'll be a valuable asset to us this season."" Rooney's performance was all the more impressive considering that he had only joined Everton a few weeks ago. He has yet to reach full fitness, but he showed glimpses of the quality that made him one of the most feared strikers in the world. The match itself was a closely contested affair, with Everton eventually winning 2-1. However, the result was secondary to the spectacle of Rooney playing in front of such an appreciative crowd. For the Tanzanian fans, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. They had the chance to see one of the greatest players of his generation up close, and they lapped it up. Rooney mania had gripped Tanzania, and it was a sight to behold. The match was also a success for Gor Mahia, who showed that they can compete with some of the best teams in Africa. The Kenyan champions gave Everton a good run for their money, and they will be confident of making an impact in the Caf Champions League this season. Overall, the match was a great advert for African football. It showed that the continent has some of the most passionate fans in the world, and that it can produce players of the highest quality. Rooney's presence in Tanzania was a reminder of the global appeal of the game, and it is sure to inspire a new generation of African footballers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ants use Sun and memories to navigate,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Scientists say they can follow a compass route, regardless of the direction in which they are facing. It is the equivalent of blindfolded humans finding their way out of a maze, except the ants are navigating a jungle. When ants forage for food they use the sun as a navigational reference, and it was thought that they could only follow a compass route when the sun was out. But researchers have shown that ants can also store the sun's position in their memories, enabling them to navigate accurately even when the sky is overcast. Dr Antoine Wystrach, who led the study and is now at Cornell University, US, said: ""They know where the sun is even if they can't see it."" The experiments, which were performed by a team at the University of Edinburgh, involved training wood ants to associate a particular compass direction (in their case, west) with a food source. The ants were then taken into a featureless arena, which was either lit from above or below so that they could not see any visual cues from the sun or sky. ""We expected that when we placed them down in the arena they would become disoriented and just wander around,"" said Dr Wystrach. ""But within a couple of minutes they started to walk in a particular direction, and they kept doing it. It was a clear indication that they were using sun compass information that they had stored in their memory."" Dr Wystrach and his colleagues then showed that the ants could still navigate accurately after a period of time in the dark - indicating that they could remember the sun's position even after an extended period without exposure to it. The researchers say that their findings could help to improve the navigation systems in robots and other artificial systems. Dr Wystrach said: ""Ants are able to use very limited amounts of information to navigate, and they do this in very complex environments. ""If we can understand how they do this, then we can use this information to design better navigation systems for robots.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lifespan gap 'widening between rich and poor',"By Judith Burns BBC News Everyone is living longer but rich people's lives are extending faster, the City University London study says. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century but this trend reversed for men in the 1980s and for women in the late 1990s. The authors say these trends are ""unlikely to improve anytime soon"". The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, looked at data from the National Health Service (NHS) for England on more than 190,000 people over a 40-year period. It found that the life expectancy of men and women has increased substantially since 1970. In 1970, a woman born in the most deprived areas could typically expect to live until just after her 71st birthday. By 2010, this had risen to just under 81. But she could still expect to die six years earlier than a baby girl born in the most affluent area. For men, the gap was wider still. In 1970, a baby boy in the most deprived areas could expect to live until he was just 65, compared with nearly 72 in the most affluent areas. By 2010, men in the most deprived areas could expect to live to 76, but this was still four years fewer than those in the most affluent areas. The researchers say the gap between rich and poor is particularly wide around the age of 60. In 2010, a 60-year-old woman living in the most deprived area of England could expect to live another 22 years, compared with 27 years for a woman in the most affluent area. For men, a similar gap exists. A 60-year-old man living in one of the most deprived areas could expect to live nearly 19 years longer, compared with 23 years for a man in the most affluent area. The authors say the widening gap between rich and poor is due to a number of factors, including differences in lifestyle, diet and access to healthcare. They say it is unlikely to improve anytime soon, as the same factors are continuing to affect people's life expectancies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'fake' painting revealed,"Since February, Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th Century work 'Young Woman' has been replaced by a $120 (£70) counterfeit, produced in China. The discovery was made after a visitor to the gallery spotted a discrepancy between the original and its supposed replacement. Upon closer examination, experts discovered that the brushstrokes were less refined, the colors were less vibrant, and the canvas was thinner than the original. The paint used in the counterfeit was also found to be of a lower quality. The Dulwich Picture Gallery has since removed the fake painting from display and is working with the police to investigate how the counterfeit came to be in its possession. It is believed that the original was stolen sometime in the past year and replaced with the fake. The gallery's director, Xavier Bray, said: ""This is a very serious matter. We are doing everything we can to find out how this happened and to ensure that it does not happen again."" The discovery of the fake painting has raised concerns about the security of art galleries and the authenticity of the artworks they display. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of fake paintings being sold to collectors and museums. In 2017, Sotheby's auction house sold a fake painting attributed to the Dutch artist Frans Hals for $10 million. The painting was later found to be a forgery, and Sotheby's was forced to refund the buyer. In 2018, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam discovered that a painting attributed to the Italian artist Caravaggio was a fake. The painting had been on display at the museum for over 200 years. The Dulwich Picture Gallery is one of the oldest public art galleries in the world. It was founded in 1811 and houses a collection of over 600 paintings. The gallery is a popular tourist destination and attracts over 300,000 visitors each year. The discovery of the fake painting has been a shock to the gallery's staff and visitors. It is hoped that the investigation will shed light on how the counterfeit came to be in the gallery's possession and will help to prevent similar incidents in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Kronospan Chirk biomass plans vote deferred for site visit,"Kronospan says the plant would provide renewable energy for its wood panel factory at Chirk and help secure 600 jobs. Opponents say the plant would harm the local environment and increase traffic. The company, which has already invested £200m in its Chirk site, said a decision on the application was likely to be made in the autumn. ""We hope the additional information we provide as part of the site visit will help councillors reach an informed decision on an application which is so important for the future of our factory and the wider community,"" said Kronospan UK managing director Ronnie Hanna. Chirk North councillor Terry Evans, who called for the deferral of the decision, said: ""I think a site visit is crucial in the determination of this application. ""At the moment members only have a desk-top view of the site and the proposed development."" The company is seeking planning permission to build the plant next to its existing factory at Rhosymedre, near Chirk, on the border of Wrexham and Shropshire. The energy-from-waste plant would generate electricity using wood waste from the factory's production processes. The plans include installing a 39-metre high stack to release emissions from the combustion process. But opponents claim the plant would release harmful pollutants and increase traffic in the area. The proposal has attracted more than 1,400 objections from people living nearby. The campaign group Chirk Against Incinerator said the site visit would allow councillors to ""see first-hand the unsuitability of the location"". ""It's great news that we have been successful in our request for a site visit,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Piercy. ""We are determined to ensure that the full impact of this ill-conceived proposal is exposed before any decision is made.""

The SGA said the RSPB was ""out of touch"" with rural communities and called on it to work with gamekeepers to help preserve the countryside. The RSPB said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the findings of the SGA report and accused the association of ""cherry-picking"" evidence. It said: ""The report ignores the overwhelming evidence of the widespread and systematic persecution of birds of prey in the UK. ""We are particularly concerned about the SGA's claim that gamekeepers have a 'unique insight' into the countryside. This is simply not true.

Iraqi security forces 'abuse female prisoners',"Many were held for months or even years without charge, the report found. Interrogators often questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than the crimes they were supposed to have committed. The Iraqi government has denied the allegations of sexual abuse, saying they are ""unfounded and politically motivated."" However, the BBC has spoken to several women who say they were held in secret detention centers and subjected to physical and sexual abuse. ""They beat me with a stick on my arms and legs,"" said one woman, who asked not to be named. ""They then put me in a cell with three other women. We were all naked."" The woman said she was held in the Abu Ghraib prison for six months without charge. She said she was repeatedly interrogated about her husband, who was a member of the Iraqi army. ""They wanted to know where he was and what he was doing,"" she said. ""They threatened to kill me if I didn't tell them."" Another woman, who was held in a secret detention center in Baghdad, said she was raped by a guard. ""I was so scared,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do."" The woman said she was held for three months without charge. She said she was never told why she was being held. The BBC has also obtained documents that show that the Iraqi government knew about the allegations of sexual abuse. In a 2005 memo, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior acknowledged that there had been ""credible reports"" of sexual abuse of female prisoners. The memo said that the ministry was investigating the allegations and would take ""appropriate action"" against any perpetrators. However, the ministry has not released any information about the results of its investigation. The allegations of sexual abuse of female prisoners in Iraq are a serious human rights concern.

The climber who bagged all 282 Munros in one winter,"By Linda Sinclair BBC Scotland News Kevin Woods, from Glasgow, is believed to be only the third person to have achieved the feat in a winter season following in the footsteps of Sir Chris Bonington and Donald Bennet.

I have worked for five years to get to this point. To complete it is amazing. ""I have been out in some horrendous conditions. I have been blown over by winds and had snow in my eyes, but it has all been worth it. ""I was 200m from the summit of Slioch when I completed the challenge. It was a great feeling although I admit the last two Munros were really hard work."" The 40-year-old began his quest to climb all 282 Munros - mountains in Scotland over 3,000ft - in the winter of 2018. He had initially aimed to complete the challenge in two years but due to bad weather and injury scaled that back to five years. He is believed to be only the 16th person ever to have climbed all 282 Munros in winter. Mr Woods said his achievement would not have been possible without the support of his wife Lorna and other supporters. ""I couldn't have done it without them,"" he said. ""I have been away from home so much and they have picked up the slack. ""I have met some great people on the Munros and made some very good friends.""

Abellio Greater Anglia rail firm faces franchise challenge,"Abellio Greater Anglia currently runs the East Anglia franchise, but it is being re-let in October 2016. It includes services to Stansted Airport and to Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex. The rail franchise is being relet because a new specification was drawn up by the Department of Transport and in order to bid for the franchise, companies had to show how they would meet this specification. Abellio has reportedly failed to meet some of the requirements and, as a result, its bid has been put in doubt. The new franchise will be awarded to the company that can meet the new specification and provide the best value for money for passengers. Abellio Greater Anglia has said that it is ""disappointed"" by the decision and that it will be ""considering its options."" However, the Department for Transport has said that it is ""confident"" that the new franchise will be awarded to a company that can meet the new specification and provide the best value for money for passengers.

Scrap dealer law aims to reduce metal theft,"All scrap dealers and motor salvage operators in England and Wales must now apply for a licence from their local authority and keep records on every transaction involving scrap metal. The new law, which came into force on 1 October 2013, is aimed at reducing metal theft, which costs the UK economy an estimated £770m a year. Under the new law, scrap dealers must keep a record of the following information for each transaction: The name and address of the seller The type and quantity of scrap metal sold The date of the transaction The price paid for the scrap metal The method of payment Scrap dealers must also keep a record of all waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) that they receive. This information must be kept for a period of three years and must be made available to the police or other authorised officers on request. Failure to comply with the new law could result in a fine of up to £5,000. The new law is part of a wider government crackdown on metal theft. In 2012, the government introduced a new offence of ""going equipped to steal metal"", which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The government has also increased the number of police officers dedicated to tackling metal theft. In 2013, the government announced that it would be investing £5m in new technology to help police officers catch metal thieves. The new law has been welcomed by the scrap metal industry. The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) said that the law would help to ""legitimise"" the scrap metal industry and make it more difficult for criminals to operate. The BMRA said that the law would also help to reduce the amount of metal theft, which has a negative impact on the environment. Metal theft can lead to pollution and damage to property. The new law is a significant step forward in the fight against metal theft. It will make it more difficult for criminals to operate and will help to reduce the amount of metal theft that takes place.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Hospices call for fundraising to continue,"Coronavirus: Hospices call for fundraising to continue Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice in Dinnington, South Yorkshire, has started a #LetsPledge campaign to keep people motivated in challenging times. It comes after Sheffield-based cancer charity Weston Park Hospital Cancer Charity closed its shops. The closure means the charity is losing out on over £30,000 a month. To make up for this shortfall, the hospice is promoting the #LetsPledge campaign, which aims to replace the income lost by people pledging the cost of an item they would have bought from a charity shop. Rob Wilson, the hospice's chief executive, said: ""We need to keep our fundraising going, because if we don't, we won't be here to care for the children and families who need us. ""There are so many ways to pledge, from setting up a monthly direct debit to donating the cost of a cup of coffee or a slice of cake. Every penny helps."" The hospice is also launching a new online shop, where people can buy items that have been donated to the charity. The shop will sell a range of items, including clothes, books, and toys. Mr. Wilson said: ""Our online shop is a great way to support the hospice and find unique items at the same time. We would encourage everyone to have a look and see what they can find."" Other hospices around the country are also feeling the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. St. Luke's Hospice in Sheffield has lost over £100,000 in income due to the closure of its shops and the cancellation of its fundraising events. The hospice's chief executive, David Whiting, said: ""This is a very difficult time for hospices. We are losing out on vital income at a time when our services are needed more than ever. ""We want to thank everyone who has supported us so far. Your donations are making a real difference to the lives of our patients and their families.""

Sixth forms in England given £91m cash injection,"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter The cash injection of £91m includes £57.4m for sixth form colleges for building needs and £30m for school and college places for 16 to 19-year-olds. A further £3.9m maintenance grant will given direct to 24 councils in England to replace school sixth forms with sixth form colleges. The government says the funding will provide 20,000 new sixth form places by 2025-26 and 30,000 new technical education places by 2024-25, including a £21m investment in new T-level classrooms. It will also part-fund the £450m expansion of the University of Suffolk. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the investment will create ""high-quality training environments"" for young people and ""ensure businesses have the skilled workforce they need"". But Labour said the announcement was ""nothing more than a drop in the ocean"" for England's ""underfunded schools and colleges"". The National Education Union (NEU) said the government is ""simply papering over the cracks"". Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said, ""The injection of capital funding does not solve the chronic underfunding of post-16 education in England. Imagine the impact on young people's life chances if this level of funding was available every year for the next 10 years."" The announcement comes amid a wider review of post-16 qualifications, including A-levels and T-levels. In December 2022, the government said it will not be making any immediate changes to A-levels. But it is considering reforms to T-levels after a report from the Education Policy Institute raised concerns about their quality. The £91m cash injection is part of a £1.6bn investment in skills and further education announced in the autumn statement. The government says this investment will help to ""level up"" skills and boost the economy. But shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government's record on education is ""nothing short of a disaster"". She said, ""Schools and colleges are facing real-terms cuts, teachers are leaving the profession in droves, and young people are being left behind.

Jerman, who has died aged 91 from coronavirus, was born in the segregated South, the son of a sharecropper. He left school at 14 to help support his family. After serving in the army during World War II, he moved to Washington DC, where he worked as a waiter and a cleaner. In 1957, he was hired as a cleaner at the White House. It was not long before his quiet competence and warm personality caught the attention of Jackie Kennedy. She had him promoted to butler, and he quickly became a trusted member of the household staff. Jerman served eight presidents, from Dwight D Eisenhower to George H W Bush. He witnessed some of the most momentous events in American history, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate scandal. He was also present at many state dinners and receptions, where he served world leaders and celebrities. Jerman was a discreet and private man, but he was also proud of his role in the White House. He once said: ""I am a butler, but I am also a historian. I have seen a lot of things, and I have learned a lot of things."" Jerman retired from the White House in 1986, but he remained active in public life. He was a frequent speaker at schools and universities, where he shared his experiences of working in the White House. He also wrote a memoir, My Life in the White House: The Extraordinary Story of the First Black Butler of the White House. Jerman's death has been met with sadness by many who knew him. Former President George W Bush said: ""Wilson Jerman was a true American hero. He served his country with honor and distinction, and he made the White House a more welcoming place for all who visited."" Former First Lady Michelle Obama said: ""Wilson Jerman was a pioneer who broke down barriers and made history. He was a role model for generations of African Americans, and his legacy will continue to inspire us all."" Jerman is survived by his wife, Doris, and their three children.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
North Korean man caught by South after crossing border,"The man, in his 20s, was wearing a diving suit and a set of fins when he was stopped in the de-militarized zone (DMZ), South Korea said. He is thought to be seeking asylum in the South. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas, with Pyongyang ramping up its missile tests and threatening to resume nuclear testing. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the man was caught in the eastern part of the DMZ shortly before midnight on Saturday. He was carrying a pair of scissors, a flashlight and some dried squid. The man told South Korean authorities that he had defected from North Korea on Friday night by swimming across the Han River, which forms part of the border between the two countries. He then walked for several hours before reaching the DMZ. The man's account of his defection is being investigated by South Korean authorities. If confirmed, he would be the first person to successfully defect from North Korea to the South by swimming across the Han River since 2019. The incident highlights the perilous journey that North Koreans face when trying to escape the repressive regime in their country. Many risk their lives by crossing the heavily fortified DMZ, which is patrolled by armed guards from both sides. The number of North Korean defectors to the South has declined in recent years, as Pyongyang has tightened border security and cracked down on defectors. However, there has been a slight increase in defections in recent months, possibly due to the worsening economic situation in North Korea. South Korea has welcomed the defector and said it will provide him with protection and support. The man is expected to be transferred to a South Korean government facility where he will be interviewed and processed. The incident is likely to further strain relations between North and South Korea, which have been on a downward spiral since the collapse of a nuclear summit between the two leaders in 2019.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Colombia offers reward after eight young partygoers killed,"Four gunmen burst into a party held at a house in Samaniego on Saturday and shot dead seven men and one woman. The victims were part of a group of about 20 revellers. The motive for the attack is still unclear, but police are investigating whether it was related to a local drug gang. The incident has shocked the community in Samaniego, which is located in the south-western Colombian department of Nariño. Nariño is one of Colombia's most violent departments, with a high rate of drug-related crime. In recent years, there has been an increase in violence in the region, as rival drug gangs battle for control of the lucrative cocaine trade. The Colombian government has offered a reward of up to 100 million pesos ($33,000) for information leading to the capture of the gunmen responsible for the attack. President Iván Duque has condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""This cowardly and heinous crime will not go unpunished,"" Duque said in a statement. ""We will continue to fight against drug trafficking and violence in all its forms."" The attack in Samaniego is the latest in a series of violent incidents that have taken place in Colombia in recent months. In January, at least 20 people were killed in a car bomb attack in the city of Cúcuta. And in March, at least 10 people were killed in a shooting at a bar in the city of Cali. The violence in Colombia is a major concern for the government, which is struggling to contain the drug trade and other forms of organised crime. The government has increased security measures in recent months, but the violence continues to escalate.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Gaia Pope: Missing teenager murder suspects released,"Gaia, 19, from Langton Matravers, Dorset, disappeared from nearby Swanage, where she had been staying, on 7 November. Rosemary Dinch, 71, and her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, both from Swanage, know no more than the rest of the community about her whereabouts, their lawyer said. Dinch is said to have helped search for Gaia after she went missing, while Elsey is believed to have been one of the last people to see her. Police have said they are keeping an open mind about Gaia's disappearance and are not ruling out the possibility that she may have come to harm. In a statement issued through their lawyer, Dinch and Elsey said: ""We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Gaia's disappearance. ""We have been doing everything we can to help the police with their inquiries and we will continue to do so. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Gaia's family and friends at this difficult time."" The pair were arrested on suspicion of murder on 19 November and have been released on bail. Gaia's disappearance has sparked a major search operation, involving police, coastguard and volunteers. Searches have been carried out across Dorset, including in Swanage, Langton Matravers and Studland. Police have also been searching the coastline and the sea. Gaia's family have appealed for information about her whereabouts. In a statement, they said: ""We are desperate for any information that will help us find Gaia. ""We have had no contact with her since she went missing and we are extremely worried about her.

US nuclear fears block Intel China supercomputer update,"Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce, which oversees exports, declined the request citing concerns that the update could benefit China's military. Intel said it was disappointed and that the decision would slow the development of artificial intelligence in the US. The company said it would continue to work with the US government to address concerns. The US has expressed concerns about China's rapidly developing artificial intelligence capabilities. In 2019, the US added several Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, citing concerns that they were developing artificial intelligence for military purposes. The US is not the only country with concerns about China's artificial intelligence capabilities. In 2018, the European Union called on China to develop ethical guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence. The US-China trade war has made it more difficult for US companies to do business in China. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and has restricted the sale of US technology to Chinese companies. The Biden administration has taken a more conciliatory approach to China, but it has not reversed the Trump administration's policies on technology exports. The decision to block the Intel export licence is a sign that the US is still concerned about China's artificial intelligence capabilities. It is also a sign that the US is willing to use trade restrictions to protect its interests. The decision is likely to have a negative impact on the US artificial intelligence industry. Intel is a leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence applications. The decision will make it more difficult for US companies to develop artificial intelligence products. The decision could also damage relations between the US and China. China has already criticised the US for blocking the Intel export licence. The decision could lead to further retaliation from China. The US-China relationship is already strained. The two countries have clashed over a range of issues, including trade, technology, and human rights. The decision to block the Intel export licence is likely to further damage the relationship.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
GP recruitment drive film 'tackles outdated stereotypes',"By Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News It has been launched by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), which claims at least 10,000 extra GPs will be needed by 2020. The three-minute film features doctors talking about how they find the job rewarding, but also extremely busy. It tackles outdated stereotypes, such as the suggestion that GPs are essentially ""gatekeepers"" whose main role is to block patients from accessing specialists. Rather it shows GPs proactively caring for the whole person, considering both their physical and mental health, and also the social circumstances that might be affecting them. In the film, newly qualified GP Dr Aneel Bhangu says: ""If you're interested in a career that's diverse and challenging, I would encourage you to look at general practice."" Dr Amir Hannan, who appears in the film alongside his wife, a fellow GP, adds: ""It's such a lovely feeling helping people get better, and that's what makes the late nights and early mornings all worthwhile."" 'Cradle to grave' care In 2017 the Health Foundation warned that the UK was facing a shortage of 10,000 family doctors by 2020. The RCGP says the situation has not improved. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, told the BBC: ""There are some outdated stereotypes about general practice that just aren't true. ""The truth is that GPs are on the frontline of healthcare, offering 'cradle to grave' care to their patients. ""They are also highly skilled clinicians who are doing more complex work than ever before."" 'Exceptionally challenging' The recruitment campaign is also targeting medical students. The film features current students talking about what attracted them to the profession. One of these is Anushka Patel, a fourth-year medical student at King's College London. She says: ""I've always loved the idea of helping people. Medicine is a really diverse profession, and general practice offers something different every day."" NHS England says it is ""committed"" to increasing the GP workforce and has allocated £2bn to help recruit family doctors. But Prof Stokes-Lampard says it will be ""exceptionally challenging"" to meet the target of 10,000 extra GPs by 2020. She said: ""We need to ensure that the current and future GP workforce is supported to stay in general practice, and that medical students and junior doctors are attracted to a career in general practice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Autism brain secrets revealed by scan,"Scans revealed children carrying the gene variant appeared to have more nerve cell ""connections"" within the frontal lobe. They had fewer connections in the temporal lobe, another brain area involved in autism. The findings help explain why the gene variant boosts the chance of autism - which affects one in 100 children in the UK. The variant is found in a gene that provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein plays a crucial role in the brain's development. In people with autism, FMRP is often faulty or missing altogether. The new research suggests that the faulty FMRP protein disrupts the normal pruning process that occurs in the brain during childhood. This process involves the shedding of excess nerve cell connections, which helps to refine the brain's neural networks. In children with the gene variant, the pruning process is thought to be less efficient, leading to an overgrowth of connections in some brain areas and a shortage in others. This imbalance may underlie the social and communication difficulties seen in autism. Dr Emily Jones, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""Our findings provide new insights into the biological mechanisms that underpin autism. ""We hope that this research will lead to new treatments that can target the underlying causes of the condition."" The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. It involved 153 children with autism and 112 typically developing children. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure the thickness of the cortex - the outermost layer of the brain - in different brain regions. They also used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the number of nerve cell connections in different brain areas. The researchers found that children with autism had thinner cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes, compared with typically developing children. They also found that children with the gene variant had more nerve cell connections in the frontal lobe and fewer connections in the temporal lobe. These findings suggest that the FMRP gene variant disrupts the normal pruning process that occurs in the brain during childhood. This leads to an imbalance of nerve cell connections in different brain areas, which may underlie the social and communication difficulties seen in autism.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Domestic violence legal aid changes were 'invalid',"Rights of Women said victims were being unlawfully denied funding in civil court cases because of changes made by ex-Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling. A rule that proof of domestic violence must be less than 24 months old was ""invalid"", the charity said. It added that guidance making victims provide evidence to police was ""unlawful"". Changes brought in by Grayling in 2013 ""were invalid because they were not made in accordance with Parliament's intention,"" Rights of Women said. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""carefully considering"" the judgment. The charity said its analysis of the changes, introduced in March 2013, showed women in eight out of 10 cases did not get legal aid because of the new rules. It is now calling for the old rules to be reinstated. Harriet Wistrich, director of Rights of Women, said: ""This is a hugely significant judgment. ""It means that the government has been unlawfully denying victims of domestic violence access to justice by wrongly removing their entitlement to legal aid. ""The government must now reinstate the old rules."" The case was brought by two women represented by the charity. In a judgment on Wednesday, the Upper Tribunal said the changes - which were designed to save the government money - were ""invalid"" because they were not ""made in accordance with Parliament's intention"". The tribunal added that a provision ""had the effect of denying access to justice to victims of domestic violence"" and that guidance issued by the Legal Aid Agency was ""unlawful"". The judgment is the latest in a series of legal challenges to Grayling's cuts to legal aid. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that changes to legal aid for civil cases were ""irrational"" because they would ""deny access to justice to some of the most vulnerable in society"". The Ministry of Justice said it was ""carefully considering"" the judgment. ""We are committed to providing access to justice for victims of domestic violence,"" a spokesman said.

Vietnam War: French court to hear landmark Agent Orange case,"The case was brought by Tran To Nga, a 78-year-old French-Vietnamese woman who covered the conflict as a journalist. She accuses the chemical firms of causing harm to her and other victims by knowingly producing and supplying a toxic herbicide that was widely used by the US military during the war. Agent Orange was a defoliant used by the US military to clear vegetation that could provide cover for enemy troops. It contained a highly toxic chemical compound called dioxin, which has been linked to a range of health problems including cancer, birth defects and nerve damage. Nga alleges that she was exposed to Agent Orange while reporting on the war and that she has suffered from health problems as a result. She is seeking compensation from the chemical firms for her suffering and for the suffering of other victims. The chemical firms have denied liability, arguing that they were not responsible for the way that Agent Orange was used by the US military. They also argue that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that Agent Orange causes the health problems that Nga and other victims allege. The case is being closely watched by victims of Agent Orange and their advocates. If Nga is successful in her case, it could set a precedent for other victims to seek compensation from the chemical firms. The trial is expected to last several weeks. The court will hear evidence from both sides and will then make a decision on whether the chemical firms are liable for the harm caused by Agent Orange. The case is a landmark moment in the fight for justice for victims of Agent Orange. It is the first time that a court has heard a case against the chemical firms that produced and supplied the herbicide. The outcome of the case could have a significant impact on the lives of victims of Agent Orange and their families.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Gentoo penguins are four species, not one","By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent According to new evidence, the birds are slightly different in shape and size, and can be told apart by their DNA. Counting them as separate species will help in conservation, they argue, making it easier to focus resources on protecting the most vulnerable. There's Adelie, Chinstrap, King and Gentoo penguins. But a new study that looked at the DNA of these black-and-white birds suggests that Gentoos are actually four different species, not one. The differences between them may be subtle but they are there, says the team at the University of California in San Diego. The birds vary slightly in shape and size, and each has a slightly different song. Their DNA also shows significant differences. This means that what was previously considered a single species of Gentoo penguin is now four separate species: Northern Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) Southern Gentoo (Pygoscelis taeniata) Eastern Gentoo (Pygoscelis ellsworthi) Western Gentoo (Pygoscelis adamsi) The researchers say that around 80% of the world's Gentoo penguins are in the Northern Gentoo species. They live in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. The other three species breed on different islands and archipelagos in the Southern Ocean and the sub-Antarctic. ""We propose the recognition of four Gentoo penguin species, which will contribute to more effective conservation,"" the team concludes in a paper published in the journal Molecular Ecology. ""Defining separate species for management and conservation is crucial for protecting biodiversity,"" said Dr Steve Emslie, from the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the new research. ""As the Gentoo penguin group is distinctive, genetically divergent, and occupies separate breeding ranges, these are all good reasons to consider them separate species."" This will help in conservation, they argue, making it easier to focus resources on protecting the most vulnerable. For example, they say that the Southern and Western Gentoo penguins may be bigger, but they are also less numerous, and more in need of protection. Lead researcher Michael Parsons said: ""Under the current paradigm, all Gentoo penguin populations are assessed as a single unit. As a result, the smaller and less-known populations such as the Southern and Western Gentoos may not be receiving the conservation attention they deserve."" Dr Emslie said that work needs to continue to understand the distinctions between the different types of Gentoo penguin. ""DNA analysis is a useful tool, but it's not the only way of separating species,"" he said. ""We also look at the birds' morphology - their shape and size - as well as their behaviour, distribution and ecology. By combining all of this information, we can build up a comprehensive picture of each species.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Microsoft reports better-than-expected earnings,"The firm reported a net income of $6.56bn (£3.94bn) for the quarter, up from $6.38bn a year earlier. Its earnings were boosted by a rise in demand for its cloud computing and software services. Analysts had predicted that Microsoft would report earnings per share of $59.65, but the company actually reported earnings per share of $61.72. This beat expectations by 3.5%. Microsoft's revenue for the quarter was $11.36bn, up from $10.85bn a year earlier. This was also above analysts' expectations, who had predicted revenue of $11.28bn. The company's cloud computing business, Azure, continues to be a major growth driver. Azure revenue grew by 30% year-over-year to $4.33bn. Microsoft's Office 365 software subscription service also continues to grow, with revenue growing by 18% year-over-year to $3.63bn. Microsoft's earnings report is a sign that the company is continuing to benefit from the shift to cloud computing and other digital services. The company is also well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing transition to remote work and learning. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said: ""Our strong commercial cloud performance reflects the trust customers are placing in us to help them navigate the digital transformation and achieve their business goals."" Microsoft's earnings report is a positive sign for the tech industry as a whole. It shows that the demand for cloud computing and other digital services is continuing to grow.

Sony to sell PC unit and cut jobs,"The company will also split its TV division into a separate subsidiary as part of its restructuring programme. The moves were announced as Sony forecast a 12% fall in annual net profit to 300 billion yen (£2.4bn). Sony said it was unable to predict a turnaround in its PC business and that its TV division had been ""negatively impacted by intensified competition in the global TV market"". Sony has not sold PCs in the US for more than a decade and has seen its market share plummet in recent years as competitors such as Lenovo and Dell have taken hold. Other key factors in the decline of Sony's PC business include the rise of smartphones and tablets, which have replaced laptops for many consumers. The TV division, meanwhile, has been hit by competition from South Korean rivals such as Samsung and LG, which have been able to offer lower prices and more advanced features. Sony has also struggled to compete with the growing popularity of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which have reduced demand for traditional TV sets. The restructuring programme is expected to take two years to complete and will involve the loss of 5,000 jobs worldwide, or around 3% of Sony's global workforce. The company said it would also sell its Vaio PC brand, which it acquired in 2014. The news comes as Sony faces increasing pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb, who has called for the company to sell off its entertainment and financial services divisions and focus on its core electronics business. Loeb, who owns a 0.6% stake in Sony, has also called for the company to buy back its own shares and increase its dividends. Sony's restructuring programme is a significant step towards addressing the challenges it faces in its core businesses.

""This was a difficult decision, but it is the right one for me and my family,"" Mr Christie said. ""I am proud of the work we have done in New Jersey, and I am excited about the future of our state."" Mr Christie was considered to be a top contender for the Republican nomination. He is a charismatic and experienced politician who has a strong record as governor. But he has also been dogged by scandals, including the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal. In recent months, Mr Christie's poll numbers have declined. He is currently trailing Donald Trump and Jeb Bush in the Republican primary polls. Mr Christie's decision not to run for president is a major blow to the Republican Party. He was one of the party's most popular and well-known figures. His departure from the race leaves the field of Republican candidates wide open. It is unclear what Mr Christie's next move will be. He has said that he plans to stay in office as governor of New Jersey. But he may also consider running for office again in the future.

Gay marriage opposed by Welsh ministers David Jones and Stephen Crabb,"His fellow Conservative and Wales Office deputy Stephen Crabb will also oppose the move. Prime Minister David Cameron faces criticism from senior Conservatives opposed to the reforms. Both Mr Jones and Mr Crabb face accusations of homophobia. But supporters say it is a matter of conscience and have warned Mr Cameron he risks alienating voters by pursuing reform. Same-sex marriage is expected to be legalised in England and Wales by 2015 if a Bill is passed. The legislation has already been published and consultation is under way. Northern Ireland and Scotland have the power to create their own laws on the issue.    Mr Jones, who is also the Secretary of State for Wales, said: ""I believe marriage is the union of a man and a woman and I know that many of my constituents share that view."" He added: ""I understand that some people believe same-sex couples should be able to marry, but I do not share that view.""   Mr Crabb, who was elected in 2005, said his ""personal view"" was that marriage was between a man and a woman. He added: ""This is not a matter of homophobia at all, but rather an issue of what the legal definition of marriage actually is and what this should be going forward."" Sayeeda Warsi, Co-Chair of the Conservative Party, said the government's proposed changes to the definition of marriage would ""strengthen society"". She warned Mr Cameron he risks alienating voters if he pursues reform. ""I get the sense that in the country and in the party, that the public are losing patience with this constant focus on same-sex marriage and gay issues,"" she said. ""It is becoming an alienating issue. I think that the prime minister needs to remember that we need to be seen as speaking to the whole of society and not just one privileged group.""    The Prime Minister has said he wants to make same-sex marriage legal because it is ""the right thing to do"". He said he believes it is a matter of equality, and that gay and lesbian couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples.    The issue of same-sex marriage has been the subject of much debate in recent years. Both sides of the argument have strong feelings on the matter. Those in favour of same-sex marriage say it is a matter of equality and that all couples should have the same rights. Those opposed to same-sex marriage say it is not in accordance with their religious beliefs, and that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police',"Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police' Despite acknowledging ""collective failings"" in the prosecution case of the climate change activist, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has concluded that there was no misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police in relation to undercover officer Mark Kennedy. The watchdog's investigation found that evidence from Kennedy, who infiltrated environmental groups for seven years, had not been properly shared or recorded. This led to the collapse of the trial last year of six activists accused of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass in 2009. However, the IPCC said there was no evidence that any officer had ""knowingly or recklessly misled"" the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It also found that the failure to disclose Kennedy's evidence was not due to ""a deliberate attempt to suppress material beneficial to the defendants."" The IPCC's findings have been welcomed by Nottinghamshire Police, which said it was ""disappointed"" by the collapse of the trial but accepted the watchdog's conclusions. ""We have learned lessons from this case and have already made improvements to our disclosure processes,"" said Chief Constable Craig Guildford. ""We are committed to ensuring that such failings do not happen again."" The activists who were cleared of the charges last year have expressed disappointment at the IPCC's findings. ""It's clear that there were serious failings in the prosecution process,"" said one of the activists, who did not want to be named. ""The IPCC's report doesn't go far enough in holding the police to account."" The IPCC's investigation was launched following a critical report by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, Paddy Tipping.

The report said children were left too long in harmful situations and risks were not properly recognised. A government official said the authority had ""demonstrated a real commitment to improving children's services"" since the inspection. Inspectors from Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the council had made ""significant progress"" in addressing the issues raised in the previous report. They found that children were now being protected better and were receiving better support. The report said: ""The council has a clear vision for children's services and is committed to improving the lives of children and young people in Middlesbrough. ""Since the last inspection, the council has taken significant steps to improve the quality of social work practice. ""This has led to a reduction in the number of children who are being looked after and an increase in the number of children who are being supported to live safely with their families."" The report also praised the council for its work with partners, such as the police and health services. It said: ""The council is working effectively with partners to identify and support children who are at risk of harm. ""This includes working with schools to ensure that children are safe and are receiving the support they need."" The council's executive member for children's services, Councillor Tony Baxter, said the report was a ""positive reflection"" of the hard work of council staff. He said: ""We have made significant progress in improving children's services in Middlesbrough. ""We know that there is still more to do, but we are confident that we are moving in the right direction."" The government official said the council should continue to focus on improving the quality of social work practice. He said: ""The council must ensure that all social workers have the skills and knowledge they need to protect children and promote their well-being. ""The council should also continue to work with partners to ensure that children are receiving the support they need.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tikrit: Iran key in fight to wrest city from IS,"By Nafiseh Kohnavard BBC Persian, Beirut Shia militia sources in Iraq have confirmed that Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, has been visiting Tikrit to oversee operations to retake the city from the Islamic State group. Gen Soleimani has been closely involved in the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, and he is credited with playing a key role in the liberation of Jurf al-Sakhar and other towns and cities from the jihadists. His presence in Tikrit is a sign of the importance that Iran attaches to the battle for the city, which is seen as a key strategic objective in the fight against IS. The Iraqi army, backed by Shia militias and Iranian advisers, launched an offensive to retake Tikrit on 2 March. The city is a former stronghold of Saddam Hussein and is seen as a symbolic prize for IS. The operation to retake Tikrit has been slow and bloody, with hundreds of Iraqi soldiers and Shia militiamen killed or wounded. IS has been putting up fierce resistance, and has used suicide bombers and car bombs to target Iraqi forces. However, the Iraqi army and its allies have made some progress in recent days, and they are now believed to be in control of most of the city. IS fighters are still holding out in some areas, but they are expected to be defeated in the coming days. The liberation of Tikrit would be a major blow to IS, which has been losing ground in Iraq and Syria in recent months. It would also be a significant victory for the Iraqi government and its allies, and it would help to boost morale among Iraqi forces. Iran has been a key player in the fight against IS in Iraq, and it is likely to continue to play a role in the country's future. Gen Soleimani's presence in Tikrit is a sign of Iran's commitment to the fight against the jihadists, and it is a reminder of the important role that Iran is playing in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pte Sean Benton: Sister hopes Army will learn from Deepcut inquest,"Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five gunshot wounds to his chest at the Surrey army base in 1995. The coroner, Judge Peter Rook QC, concluded on Wednesday that he suffered an ""unsurvivable"" head injury ""as a consequence of a violent struggle."" The inquest heard that Pte Benton had been transferred to Deepcut after he was suspected of making death threats against a fellow recruit at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. His sister, Tracy Lewis, said she hoped the Army would learn from his tragic death. ""I hope they look at all the evidence and try to improve things so that this never happens again,"" she said. The inquest heard that Pte Benton had been struggling to cope with Army life and had been bullied by his superiors. He had also been prescribed antidepressants and sleeping pills. On the day of his death, he had been on a training exercise when he went missing. His body was found later that day in a wooded area of the base. The inquest heard that there were a number of inconsistencies in the Army's account of what happened on the day of Pte Benton's death. For example, the Army initially said that he had been shot while trying to escape from custody. However, the inquest heard that he was not in custody at the time of his death. The Army also initially said that Pte Benton had been shot by a single bullet. However, the inquest heard that he had been shot five times. Judge Rook said that he was ""satisfied"" that Pte Benton had been killed by another person. However, he said that there was not enough evidence to say who that person was. He also said that he was ""concerned"" about the Army's handling of the investigation into Pte Benton's death. He said that the Army had ""failed to adequately investigate"" a number of key issues. The Army has said that it will ""carefully consider"" the coroner's findings. It has also said that it is ""committed to learning from the tragic events"" of Pte Benton's death.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Newquay man weeding his way around town,"Alex Russell, from Newquay in Cornwall, suffers with anxiety and depression but said starting the activity during the lockdown helped with his mental health. The 21-year-old said: ""I started doing it for something to do. It keeps my mind occupied and helps take my mind off everything. ""I've only been doing it for a couple of months, but I've already noticed a difference in my mental health. ""I'm less anxious and I'm sleeping better. I'm also more motivated to do other things."" Alex is not the only one who has found solace in weeding during the lockdown. Greenfingers, a charity that supports gardening in healthcare facilities, has reported a surge in interest in its services since the start of the pandemic. Chief executive Sue Allen said: ""Gardening can be a great way to improve mental health and well-being. ""It can help to reduce stress, improve mood and boost self-esteem. ""It can also provide a sense of purpose and achievement."" Alex said he would encourage others to give weeding a try. ""It's a great way to get some fresh air and exercise, and it can really help with your mental health,"" he said. ""Even if you don't have a garden, you can still get involved by helping out with a local community group or gardening project."" Here are some tips for getting started with weeding: Start small. Don't try to tackle your entire garden at once. Just focus on a small area that you can easily manage. Use the right tools. A good weeding tool will make the job much easier. There are a variety of tools available, so find one that you find comfortable to use. Be patient. Weeding can be a slow and tedious job, but it's worth it in the end. Just take your time and enjoy the process. Be mindful. Weeding can be a great opportunity to practice mindfulness. Pay attention to the sensations of your body as you work, and focus on the present moment. Enjoy the results. Once you've finished weeding, take a step back and admire your work. You'll be amazed at how much better your garden looks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
British Airways fined £20m over data breach,"The breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data. The fine is considerably smaller than the £183m that the ICO originally said it intended to issue. In a statement, BA said it had ""cooperated fully"" with the ICO's investigation and had ""taken steps to strengthen its IT security"". ""We are pleased that the ICO has recognised the significant steps we have taken since the incident to enhance our data security,"" the statement said. ""We remain committed to protecting our customers' data and we will continue to invest in our security measures."" The ICO said it had taken into account BA's ""prompt and effective response"" to the breach when setting the fine. ""BA has taken a number of positive steps since the breach, including investing significantly in its IT security and appointing an independent expert to review its data protection practices,"" the ICO said in a statement. ""We believe that the £20m fine reflects the seriousness of the breach, but also recognises the positive steps that BA has taken since then."" The BA breach is one of the largest data breaches in recent years. It affected around 400,000 customers and resulted in the loss of personal data, including names, addresses, email addresses, and credit card numbers. The breach was caused by a cyber-attack on BA's website. The attackers were able to access customer data by exploiting a vulnerability in the website's software. BA has since taken a number of steps to improve its IT security, including: Investing in new security software and hardware Appointing an independent expert to review its data protection practices Updating its staff on data protection best practices The ICO's investigation into the BA breach is ongoing.

Richard Desmond 'plans National Lottery bid',"The plans by Mr Desmond, who runs the Health Lottery, have been reported in the Financial Times. Camelot has held the UK's lottery franchise since it was set up in 1994, operating it on behalf of the government and the National Lottery Distribution Fund. The current licence expires in 2024 and the Gambling Commission is expected to start the process of awarding the new licence next year. The Health Lottery was launched in 2011 and is operated by Mr Desmond's Northern & Shell media group. It has faced criticism for its low returns to good causes, but Mr Desmond has said it has raised more than £100m for health-related charities. Camelot has said it does not comment on speculation about the lottery licence. In a statement, the Gambling Commission said: ""We will run a fair and open competition for the fourth National Lottery licence, which will ensure that the lottery is run with integrity and that it continues to raise significant sums of money for good causes."" Mr Desmond is a controversial figure in the media industry. He owns the Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers, as well as the OK! magazine brand. He has been accused of using his media outlets to promote his business interests and attack his rivals. In 2012, he was found guilty of phone hacking by the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics. The Health Lottery has also been criticised for its links to Mr Desmond's other businesses. In 2015, the Gambling Commission fined the Health Lottery £6m for failing to prevent money laundering. The commission said the Health Lottery had failed to carry out proper checks on customers who were depositing large sums of money. Mr Desmond has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the Health Lottery is a legitimate business. If Mr Desmond's bid for the National Lottery licence is successful, it would give him control of one of the UK's most lucrative gambling operations. The National Lottery generates around £4bn in revenue each year, with around £2bn going to good causes. The Gambling Commission is expected to make a decision on the new licence in 2023.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scientists find 'better way' to grow adult stem cells,"Standard surfaces have proved limited for growing large amounts and retaining the stem cells' useful characteristics. It is hoped the discovery could lead to the creation of stem cell therapies to treat a range of conditions. The researchers, whose work is published in Nature Communications, used a technique called electrospinning to create a nanofibre scaffold that mimics the natural environment of stem cells. This scaffold provides a more supportive and three-dimensional structure for the cells to grow on. In tests, the researchers found that the new scaffold allowed them to grow 10 times more stem cells than on standard surfaces. The stem cells also retained their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types, which is essential for their use in therapies. ""This is a significant breakthrough in the field of stem cell research,"" said lead researcher Professor Molly Stevens of Imperial College London. ""For the first time, we have been able to grow large amounts of stem cells on a surface that mimics their natural environment. This opens up the potential for using stem cells to treat a range of conditions, from heart disease to Alzheimer's."" The researchers are now working on developing the technology further and testing it in clinical trials. They hope that the new scaffold could eventually be used to create stem cell therapies that are safe and effective for treating a wide range of diseases. Stem cells are unspecialised cells that have the potential to develop into any cell in the body. They are therefore seen as a promising source of cells for use in therapies to treat a range of conditions, such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. However, growing stem cells in the laboratory has proved challenging. Standard surfaces have not been able to support the growth of large amounts of stem cells, and the cells often lose their ability to differentiate into different cell types. The new scaffold developed by the researchers overcomes these problems. It provides a more supportive and three-dimensional structure for the cells to grow on, and it helps to maintain their ability to differentiate. This makes it a promising platform for the development of stem cell therapies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says","Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, the Ministry of Justice said. Prisoners will only be allowed out for a few hours at a time, with no overnight stays, and only if they are assessed as being at low risk of reoffending. The changes follow a review of the scheme by the Ministry of Justice, which found that it was not working as well as it could be. The review found that some prisoners were being released on day release who should not have been, and that the scheme was not doing enough to help prisoners reintegrate into society. The new rules will be introduced in phases, starting with a pilot scheme in six prisons. The pilot scheme will run for six months, and the results will be evaluated before the new rules are rolled out to all prisons. The Ministry of Justice said that the new rules will make the scheme more effective and will help to protect the public. The changes have been welcomed by some, but others have expressed concern that they will make it harder for prisoners to reintegrate into society. The Prison Reform Trust said that the changes were ""a step in the wrong direction"" and that they would make it harder for prisoners to maintain family ties and to find work. However, the Howard League for Penal Reform said that the changes were ""necessary"" and that they would help to make the scheme more effective. The changes to the day release scheme are part of a wider package of reforms to the prison system. The reforms include plans to introduce new ""boot camps"" for young offenders and to give prisoners more opportunities to learn skills and qualifications. The government says that the reforms are necessary to make the prison system more effective and to reduce reoffending.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cancer costing European Union countries 'billions',"The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a ""huge burden"". The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of healthcare, lost productivity and premature death. The study found that the annual economic cost of cancer in the EU was €179 billion (£155 billion; $209 billion). This is equivalent to 1.3% of the EU's gross domestic product (GDP). The cost of cancer is expected to rise to €246 billion (£214 billion; $289 billion) by 2030. The study also found that the number of cancer cases in the EU is expected to increase by 26% by 2030. This is due to a number of factors, including the ageing population and unhealthy lifestyles. The five most common cancers in the EU are breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. The study's authors say that the rising cost of cancer is a major concern for European governments. They say that more needs to be done to prevent cancer and to improve the treatment and care of cancer patients. The European Commission has pledged to invest €4 billion (£3.5 billion; $4.7 billion) in cancer research over the next seven years. The Commission is also working to improve access to cancer screening and treatment. Cancer is a major public health challenge in the EU. The rising cost of cancer is a concern for governments and healthcare systems. More needs to be done to prevent cancer and to improve the treatment and care of cancer patients. What can be done to reduce the cost of cancer? There are a number of things that can be done to reduce the cost of cancer, including: Prevention: Preventing cancer is the most effective way to reduce its cost. This can be done by promoting healthy lifestyles, such as eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular exercise. It is also important to get vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B, which can both cause cancer. Early detection: Detecting cancer early can lead to more effective treatment and better outcomes for patients. This is why it is important to get regular cancer screenings, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and Pap tests. Effective treatment: Advances in cancer treatment have led to improved survival rates for patients. However, cancer treatment can be expensive. Governments and healthcare systems need to ensure that patients have access to the most effective treatments. Palliative care: Palliative care is important for improving the quality of life for cancer patients. This care can help patients manage their symptoms and cope with the challenges of living with cancer. By taking these steps, we can reduce the cost of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Man guilty of killing unborn baby by kicking mum's stomach,"Malorie Bantala, 22, was ambushed outside her Peckham home by Kevin Wilson, 22, and a teenager on 15 June. She suffered life-threatening injuries and was rushed to hospital where her baby boy was delivered stillborn. Wilson was convicted of manslaughter and child destruction at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. The teenager was cleared of all charges. The court heard that Wilson had been in a relationship with Ms Bantala, but they had split up a few months before the attack. On the day of the incident, Wilson and the teenager approached Ms Bantala as she was walking home from work. Wilson began kicking and punching her in the stomach, causing her to collapse. Prosecutor Alexandra Healy QC said that the attack was ""motivated by anger and jealousy"". She said that Wilson had been ""angry that [Ms Bantala] had moved on with her life"" and that he had ""intended to cause her really serious harm"". Wilson denied the charges, claiming that he had acted in self-defense. He said that Ms Bantala had attacked him with a knife and that he had only kicked her in order to disarm her. The jury rejected Wilson's claims and found him guilty of manslaughter and child destruction. He is due to be sentenced on 22 November. In a statement, Ms Bantala said that she was ""relieved"" that Wilson had been found guilty. She said that the attack had ""destroyed my life"" and that she was still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her baby. ""I want to thank the jury for finding him guilty,"" she said. ""I hope that his conviction will bring some closure to what has been a very difficult time for me and my family."" Det Ch Insp Neil John said that the attack was ""a senseless and brutal act of violence"". He said that Wilson had shown ""no remorse"" for his actions and that he deserved to be punished severely. ""This was a horrific attack on a young woman who was simply trying to get on with her life,"" he said. ""Wilson's actions have had a devastating impact on Malorie and her family, and I hope that his conviction will bring them some small measure of comfort.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tenerife beheading: Murder suspect 'haunted by voices',"Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov, 29, said he is haunted by voices that ""direct how I act"", and admitted having taken crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest.

"Tata Steel: Pension fund deficit deters buyers, says Javid","The pension fund has more than 130,000 members and a deficit of £485m. He told the Business select committee: ""It's not unreasonable ... to say 'look we're interested in the assets but this would be an issue'."" The UK government has been trying to sell Tata Steel's UK operations since they were put up for sale in March. But Mr Javid said selling the whole of the business could lead to the government having to bail out the pension fund. He said: ""The key issue with Tata Steel is not the assets. The assets are attractive and you've already had people express interest. ""The issue is the pension fund. It's a huge pension fund and it's got a big deficit. ""If we were to sell the whole of Tata Steel, the government would be on the hook for that pension fund. So that is a major issue."" Mr Javid said the government was continuing to talk to Tata Steel about its options, but said it was ""not straightforward"". ""There is a lot of interest in the assets, but the pension fund is a major issue,"" he said. Tata Steel has been loss-making for several years and has been hit by cheap imports from China and high energy costs.

Wales weather: M4 clear after Storm Frank flooding,"Police dealt with three separate crashes where there was standing water on both sides of the carriageway between junctions 35 (Pencoed) and 36 (Sarn). Flooding also blocked one lane eastbound near junction 32 (Coryton Interchange). Officers advised drivers to avoid driving through floodwater and, if they had to, to reduce their speed. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Ely burst its banks in St Athan throughout the night, leading to flooding on the A48 and nearby roads, but the water was receding by Monday morning. It also issued a number of flood alerts across the south of the country, including the River Taff catchment, River Cynon, River Rhondda, River Ewenny, River Ogmore and River Ely. The Met Office said that while most of the rain from Storm Frank had now passed, further heavy showers were expected on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. NRW warned that river levels are likely to remain high in some areas for the next few days, and that further flooding could occur if there is heavy rainfall. The Environment Agency in England has also issued a number of flood alerts and warnings, including for the River Severn and the River Thames. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain for south-west England and south Wales, which is in place until Tuesday morning. It said there is a risk of further flooding and travel disruption in some areas. The RAC said it had attended more than 5,000 breakdowns on Sunday, with the majority of call-outs being for vehicles that had broken down due to flooding. It urged drivers to avoid driving through floodwater, as even a small amount of water can cause a vehicle to stall. The AA also advised drivers to be cautious when driving in wet weather, and to reduce their speed and increase their following distance.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cambridgeshire teen felt 'not believed' after abuse probe dropped,"Chris Gould, 17, died in January 2019 while an informal patient at a mental health unit near Cambridge. Her parents told the inquest that clinicians felt alleged sexual abuse by a member of staff was ""not credible"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the unit, said it was ""deeply sorry"" for Chris's death and accepted the inquest's findings. The inquest heard that Chris had been admitted to the unit in December 2018 after attempting to take her own life. She had a history of self-harm and had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. While at the unit, Chris alleged that she had been sexually abused by a member of staff. The allegations were investigated by the police, but no charges were brought. Chris's parents said they were ""not believed"" by clinicians when they raised concerns about the alleged abuse. They said that they felt ""fobbed off"" and that the unit was ""more interested in protecting its staff than in protecting patients"". The inquest jury found that the alleged abuse was a ""contributory factor"" to Chris's death. It also found that the unit had failed to provide adequate care for Chris and that there had been a ""lack of communication"" between staff. The trust said it had ""learned lessons"" from Chris's death and had made changes to its safeguarding procedures. It said it was ""committed to providing safe and high-quality care for all patients"". Chris's parents said they were ""relieved"" that the inquest had found that the alleged abuse was a ""contributory factor"" to their daughter's death. They said they hoped that the trust would ""learn from its mistakes"" and that other families would not have to go through what they had. The inquest is one of a number of recent cases that have raised concerns about the care of young people in mental health units. In February, an inquest into the death of 14-year-old Amy El-Keria found that she had been failed by the mental health system. Amy died in 2019 after taking her own life.

Chase criticised for 'mocking' customers' spending habits,"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Offering financial advice on Twitter, the bank appeared to chastise consumers who question their low bank balances but buy take-away coffee and short taxi rides. The meme was roundly criticized for being condescending and out of touch with the financial difficulties faced by many people. ""Millions of people are worried about the rising cost of living and how to make ends meet,"" said a spokesperson for the consumer group Which? ""It's unhelpful and unkind for a bank to imply that people are struggling financially because they are spending money on small treats or conveniences."" The bank has since apologized for the tweet, saying that it was not intended to be judgmental. ""We recognize that the cost of living is rising and that many people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are committed to helping our customers manage their finances and make the most of their money."" However, the tweet has sparked a wider debate about the role of banks in society. Some argue that banks should be doing more to help customers manage their finances, while others believe that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own financial decisions. ""Banks have a responsibility to help their customers,"" said Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com. ""They should be providing clear and impartial advice, and helping people to understand their finances and make informed decisions."" However, others argue that individuals need to take more responsibility for their own financial decisions. ""People need to be more aware of how they are spending their money and make changes if necessary,"" said a spokesperson for the National Consumer Council. ""Banks can't be held responsible for people's poor financial decisions."" The debate is likely to continue as the cost of living continues to rise. In the meantime, it is important for individuals to be aware of how they are spending their money and make changes if necessary. Banks can also play a role in helping customers manage their finances, but ultimately, individuals are responsible for their own financial decisions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ex-Australian PMs make appeal over Bali Nine drug pair,"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were given the death sentence in 2006 for leading a drug trafficking group known as the Bali Nine. The former prime ministers said they deserved clemency. An Indonesian official has told the BBC that President Widodo has not yet made a decision on the pair's fate, but that he is aware of the pleas for clemency. The former Australian prime ministers, Tony Abbott, John Howard and Malcolm Fraser, have written to Indonesian President Joko Widodo, urging him to grant clemency to two Australian drug smugglers on death row. In the letter, the former leaders said that Chan and Sukumaran had shown ""genuine remorse"" for their crimes and had been rehabilitated during their time in prison. They also said that the pair's execution would damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. ""We believe that the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran would be a grave injustice and a serious setback to the relationship between our two countries,"" the letter said. The letter was sent ahead of a meeting between Widodo and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Jakarta on Thursday. Turnbull is expected to raise the issue of Chan and Sukumaran's execution with Widodo. The Indonesian government has said that it will not grant clemency to Chan and Sukumaran. However, President Widodo has the final say on whether or not the pair will be executed.

"Sir Alan Parker, director of Bugsy Malone and Evita, dies aged 76","The double Oscar nominee's many other credits include Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning, The Commitments, Angela's Ashes and Birdy. Evita composer Andrew Lloyd Webber tweeted Sir Alan had been ""one of the few directors to truly understand musicals on screen"". The Phantom of the Opera and Cats impresario added: ""He will be much missed."" Sir Alan's death was announced by the British Film Institute. No cause of death was given. Born in Islington, north London, Sir Alan began his career as an advertising copywriter, before moving into film in the 1970s. His first feature as director, the London-set gangster comedy Bugsy Malone, was released in 1976 and starred children, including a young Jodie Foster. Bugsy Malone was followed by Midnight Express (1978), which was nominated for six Oscars and won two, and Fame (1980). Sir Alan was nominated for best director at the Academy Awards in 1988 for Mississippi Burning, an examination of race and civil rights in the US. In 1996, he directed the film version of Evita, for which Madonna received a Golden Globe Award for best actress in a musical or comedy. The Commitments, released in 1991, was a musical comedy about a group of young musicians from Dublin. The film was a critical and commercial success and launched the career of Irish singer Glen Hansard, who played the lead character. As well as feature films, Sir Alan also directed commercials, short films and music videos. He was awarded a Bafta Fellowship in 2013. He was married to Lisa Moran and is survived by their five children. Tributes have poured in for Sir Alan from the world of film and music. ""I am very sad to hear of the passing of Sir Alan Parker, a truly great British director who made so many iconic films,"" said BFI chair Tim Richards.

Film director Edgar Wright described Sir Alan as ""one of our greatest filmmakers"" and said his work ""defined a generation of British cinema"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
War Horse musicians lose legal bid,"The musicians took legal action last week following the theatre's decision to end their contribution - of playing live over a pre-recorded soundtrack. They had sought an injunction to be allowed back on stage, but their bid was unsuccessful. The theatre contends that the use of a pre-recorded soundtrack enhances the storytelling and brings the production closer to the film on which it is based. However, the musicians argued that they had a ""unique and irreplaceable role"" in the show and that their removal diminished the experience for audiences. In their High Court ruling, Deputy High Court Judge, Anthony Mann, said that while the musicians' removal had caused them ""considerable distress and disappointment"", it was within the theatre's rights to make the change. The judge also rejected the musicians' argument that the theatre had breached the terms of their agreement. A spokesperson for the theatre said that they were ""pleased with the court's decision"" and that they ""remain committed to providing our audiences with the best possible experience"". The theatre also said that they would be ""exploring ways to recognise the contribution that the musicians have made to War Horse over the past 10 years"". The musicians have expressed their disappointment with the outcome and are considering their options. They said in a statement, ""We're very sad to have to accept that the curtain has come down on our time at War Horse. We're proud of our contribution to the success of the show and we're grateful to the audiences who have enjoyed our music over the last decade."" War Horse has been a critical and commercial success since its premiere in 2007.

Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third,"Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third More than 2,500 charges were investigated in 2018-19, up from 1,894 the previous year. Alleged ""breach of security"" - which includes the unauthorised introduction of contraband - accounted for more than a third of all charges. The figures, obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to HM Prison and Probation Service, also show a rise in allegations of assault, violence, discrimination and bullying. There were 557 allegations of assault in 2018-19, compared with 389 the previous year. And there were 229 allegations of discrimination, up from 183 in 2017-18. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to creating a safe and secure environment for all prisoners and staff"" and that it would ""not tolerate any form of misconduct or abuse"". The rise in misconduct allegations comes at a time when the prison system is menghadapi increasing pressure. The number of people in prison in England and Wales has risen by more than 20,000 since 2010, and the prison population is now at its highest level since the early 19th century. The number of prison staff has also fallen in recent years, and there are now just over 28,000 prison officers in England and Wales, compared with 33,000 in 2010. This has led to concerns that prisons are understaffed and that staff are struggling to cope with the increased workload. The Prison Officers' Association said the rise in misconduct allegations was a ""serious concern"" and that it was a ""reflection of the pressure that prison staff are under"". ""The government needs to invest in the prison service and provide more resources for staff,"" said POA general secretary Steve Gillan. ""We also need to see a change in the culture of the prison system. Too often, prisoners are treated with disrespect and violence, and this creates a hostile and dangerous environment for staff."" The BBC spoke to several prison officers who said they had been victims of misconduct. One officer, who did not want to be named, said he had been assaulted by a prisoner on several occasions. ""I've been punched, kicked and spat at,"" he said. ""I've also been threatened with death. It's a very dangerous job, and I'm constantly worried about my safety."" Another officer said she had been discriminated against because of her gender. ""I've been told that I'm not strong enough to be a prison officer,"" she said. ""I've also been told that I'm only in the job because I want to meet men. It's really demoralising."" The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to protecting staff from harm"" and that it would ""not tolerate any form of misconduct or abuse"". ""We have introduced a number of measures to improve the safety of prison staff, including increasing the number of body-worn cameras and introducing new training programmes,"" a spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Theresa May warning over police targets 'comeback',"She told the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales that the government had scrapped ""top-down diktats"" and urged police confidence in the new approach. ""We have scrapped inappropriate top-down diktats,"" she said. ""The days of unrealistic targets and unnecessary bureaucracy are over."" The home secretary promised that the new policing model would give forces the flexibility to set their own targets and priorities. ""We will continue to work with you to develop a more flexible and less bureaucratic approach to policing that keeps the public safe,"" she said. May's comments come amid concerns that the government is planning to reintroduce police targets. Last year, the government announced that it would be scrapping police targets in favor of a new system of ""outcomes-based policing."" However, there have been reports that the government is considering bringing back some form of targets. In her speech, May did not rule out the possibility of reintroducing targets, but she said that any new system would be ""proportionate"" and ""effective."" ""We will not introduce targets for targets' sake,"" she said. ""Any targets we do introduce will be proportionate and effective."" May's comments were welcomed by the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales. ""We welcome the home secretary's commitment to a more flexible and less bureaucratic approach to policing,"" said Paul Griffiths, the association's president. ""We believe that this will give forces the freedom to set their own priorities and to focus on what matters most to their communities."" The government's decision to scrap police targets has been controversial. Some argue that targets are necessary to ensure that the police are held accountable for their performance. Others argue that targets can lead to perverse incentives and can result in the police focusing on the wrong things. The government's new policing model is still in its early stages of development. It remains to be seen whether it will be successful in reducing crime and improving public confidence in the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Bristol friends raise £5,500 after free school meal upset","Chloe and Imogen Wood were shocked to see the lack of food given to families for free school meals packages. In one week they raised £3,460 online and more than £2,000 offline, filling a dozen trolleys of food that were split between three local charities. They were inspired to act after seeing a photo on Facebook of a free school meal package sent to a family of four. ""It had two potatoes, two carrots, a small bag of pasta, one onion, a pepper and a 90p voucher for fruit and veg,"" Chloe said. ""That is not enough to feed a family, let alone a family of four for a week."" The sisters were so appalled by the image that they decided to do something about it. They launched a GoFundMe page, with the aim of raising enough money to provide 100 families with a week's worth of food. Within 24 hours, they had reached their target. A week later, they had raised more than £5,000. ""We were not expecting this at all,"" Chloe said. ""We thought we might get a few hundred pounds, but we never thought we would raise this much."" The sisters have been working with three local charities - the Trussell Trust, FareShare and Children's Food Aid Network - to distribute the food. They have also been working with local businesses to get food donated at a discounted price. They are using the money raised to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as long-life items such as pasta, rice and tinned food. The charities involved in the distribution of the food have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the sisters and the local community. ""This is an incredible gesture from Chloe and Imogen,"" said a spokesperson for the Trussell Trust. ""It will make a real difference to the families we support."" FareShare said the donation was ""a lifeline"" for the charity. ""We are so grateful to Chloe and Imogen for their support,"" a spokesperson said. ""This donation will help us to continue to provide vital food supplies to people in need."" The Children's Food Aid Network said the donation was ""a wonderful example of community spirit."" ""This is a great example of how people can come together to make a difference,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are so grateful to Chloe and Imogen for their support.""

Ronan Kerr's brother attacks Tom Elliott 'scum' remarks,"Tom Elliott hit out at people waving Irish flags at Omagh Leisure Centre, calling them the ""scum of Sinn Fein"". On his Twitter account, Cathair Kerr, Ronan Kerr's brother, attacked the comments, saying ""Look who's talking. Tom Elliott, former member of the Ulster Resistance terror gang."" Elliott, a former politician for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has a history of making controversial statements. In 2017, he was suspended from the party after he said he would not share a platform with Sinn Fein because they were ""terrorists"". Kerr's brother, Ronan Kerr, was a Catholic police officer who was killed by dissident republicans in 2011. Kerr was a vocal critic of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), accusing them of being too close to Sinn Fein. In a statement, the PSNI said it was ""aware of the comments made by Mr Elliott and is considering its response"". The incident has sparked outrage from politicians and community leaders. Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly said Elliott's comments were ""disgraceful"" and ""designed to stir up sectarian hatred"". SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Elliott's comments were ""deeply offensive"" and ""have no place in our society"". Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Elliott's comments were ""reckless and irresponsible"" and called on him to withdraw them. The Irish government has also condemned Elliott's comments. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Elliott's comments were ""inflammatory and unhelpful"" and called on him to ""reconsider his words"". Elliott has since apologized for his comments, saying he ""regrets the hurt and offense"" they caused. However, he has not withdrawn the comments. The incident has raised concerns about the rise of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. In recent years, there have been a number of incidents of sectarian violence, including attacks on churches and community centers. Police have warned that sectarianism is a ""serious threat"" to peace in Northern Ireland and have urged people to report any incidents of sectarianism to the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander,"The appointment of Mr Alexander to his second Cabinet post in less than a month marks the next step in his rapid political rise. Virtually unknown outside his native Scotland a decade ago, he is now one of the most influential figures in the UK government. Alexander, 41, was born in Perth and educated at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He worked as a financial journalist before entering politics, and was elected to the House of Commons in 2005. He served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2010 to 2015, and was responsible for overseeing the government's austerity programme. He was also involved in the negotiations that led to the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Alexander was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 2015, but he resigned from the post in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union. He has since been a vocal critic of Brexit, and has called for a second referendum on the issue. Alexander's appointment as Treasury Chief Secretary is seen as a sign that the government is taking a more pro-European stance. He is a strong supporter of the single market and the customs union, and he has said that he wants to ""keep all options on the table"" in the Brexit negotiations. Alexander's appointment has been welcomed by the business community. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that he was ""a safe pair of hands"" who would ""bring a wealth of experience to the role."" However, some critics have questioned Alexander's credentials for the job. They point out that he has no experience in the Treasury, and that he has been a vocal critic of the government's austerity programme. Despite the criticism, Alexander is expected to be a key figure in the government's Brexit negotiations. He is a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, and he is likely to play a leading role in shaping the government's approach to the talks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Childcare recruitment 'catastrophe' looms, say campaigners","By Judith Burns Education reporter New recruits to key jobs must have at least GCSE C grades in the subjects, with alternative equivalent qualifications no longer accepted. The Save our Early Years campaign group said it means a ""catastrophe"" is looming for the sector, with thousands of qualified candidates facing being turned away. The Department for Education (DfE) said the reforms were ""not about excluding people"" but ensuring all childcare professionals have strong literacy and numeracy skills. From September 2023, all level 2 and level 3 early years educators will need at least a C grade in GCSE English and maths, or an approved equivalent. This is a change from the current rules, which allow alternative qualifications, such as functional skills or entry-level certificates, to be used instead. The Save our Early Years campaign group said this will affect thousands of qualified candidates who do not have GCSEs or the approved equivalent qualifications. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, which runs nurseries in England, said: ""We are facing a recruitment catastrophe. ""This new requirement will make it all but impossible for nurseries to recruit new staff, which will inevitably lead to settings having to close or reduce their opening hours."" Mr Leitch said many people working in the early years sector come from disadvantaged backgrounds and may not have had the opportunity to achieve GCSEs. He said: ""The vast majority of them are incredibly capable and passionate about working with young children."" The DfE said the reforms were ""not about excluding people"" but ensuring all childcare professionals have strong literacy and numeracy skills. A DfE spokesperson said: ""Children deserve the best possible start in life and we want to make sure that all early years practitioners have strong literacy and numeracy skills. ""We are not seeking to exclude people from working in the sector, but to ensure they have the essential skills needed for effective practice."" The DfE said alternative routes into the sector will still be available for those who do not have GCSEs or equivalent qualifications, such as apprenticeships and traineeships.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
#ElPasochallenge: Boy responds to shooting to help community heal,"Ruben Martinez is the youngster behind the #elpasoCHALLENGE. He wants people to carry out 22 random acts of kindness to honour the victims of the El Paso shooting. The challenge, which has quickly spread on social media, comes in response to the horrific attack on a Walmart store in Texas, which left 22 people dead. Ruben, 12, is a sixth-grader at Bassett Middle School in El Paso. He is raising money for the El Paso Victims Relief Fund, which is providing financial assistance to those affected by the shooting. Ruben says he was inspired to start the challenge after seeing a quote from the Dalai Lama: ""If you want others to be happy, practise compassion. If you want to be happy, practise compassion."" He says: ""We have to be there for each other. We have to support each other. We have to show that we're stronger than this."" The challenge has already had a huge impact, with people across the country sharing their stories of how they are carrying out acts of kindness. One woman shared how she paid for the person behind her in the grocery line. Another told how she donated blood. Ruben says he is ""blown away"" by the response to the challenge. ""It shows that we are all connected,"" he says. ""We can make a difference in the world, one act of kindness at a time."" How to take part in the #elpasoCHALLENGE To take part in the challenge, simply carry out 22 random acts of kindness.

NSA workers disciplined over Snowden leaks,"The employee was among three NSA workers sanctioned over the incident, according to an NSA memo. It is said to be the first disciplinary action taken over the breach, which the agency has previously called one of the ""most significant security breaches in US history"". The memo said two other employees had their security clearances revoked and were barred from accessing classified information. Snowden copied and leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance programs, including its PRISM program, which collected data from internet companies. The leaks sparked a global debate about the balance between national security and privacy. The NSA has said that the leaks caused ""significant damage"" to national security. The memo did not specify the specific actions taken against the three employees. The news of the disciplinary action comes amid growing scrutiny of the NSA's surveillance programs. In June, the US Senate voted to end the NSA's bulk collection of phone records. The program was authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The House of Representatives has yet to vote on the measure. The NSA has defended the bulk collection program, saying it is a valuable tool in preventing terrorism. However, critics say the program is an invasion of privacy and has not been shown to be effective in preventing terrorism. The disciplinary action against the three NSA workers is likely to further fuel the debate about the NSA's surveillance programs. It is also likely to raise questions about the agency's ability to protect classified information.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Manila district police force removed after teen deaths,"Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said 1,200 officers from the Caloocan district would be retrained and then assigned to other units. The move comes amid growing scrutiny of police operations amid accusations of extrajudicial killings and corruption. The Caloocan district police force has been under fire since the deaths of two teenagers in drug raids. The deaths of Kian Loyd delos Santos and Carl Angelo Arnaiz sparked outrage and protests in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte has defended the police, but has also said that he will not tolerate abuses. He has ordered the police to stop conducting drug raids and has created a new task force to investigate the deaths of the teenagers. The removal of the Caloocan district police force is a significant development. It is a sign that the government is taking the allegations of extrajudicial killings and corruption seriously. However, it remains to be seen whether the retraining and reassignment of the officers will be enough to address the systemic problems within the police force. The Philippine National Police (PNP) has been plagued by allegations of corruption and abuse for years. A 2017 report by the Human Rights Watch found that the PNP had ""a long history of committing grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances."" The report also found that the PNP was ""systematically failing to investigate and prosecute human rights violations committed by its officers."" The PNP has denied the allegations of systemic abuse and corruption. However, the recent deaths of the two teenagers have raised serious questions about the force's commitment to human rights. The removal of the Caloocan district police force is a welcome step, but it is only a first step. The government must do more to address the systemic problems within the PNP. This includes investigating and prosecuting human rights violations, reforming the force's training and recruitment procedures, and increasing transparency and accountability.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stars stay silent in X Factor protest,"By Ian Youngs Entertainment reporter, BBC News Madness star Suggs and dance acts Orbital and Pendulum were among those who did nothing in a recording studio. They were recreating the recording session that led to the Sex Pistols' classic track ""God Save the Queen"". The Sex Pistols refused to sing along to the backing track, in a form of protest against the monarchy during the Queen's silver jubilee in 1977. The protesters hope to get their new version of the song to number one by the time of the Queen's diamond jubilee next year. Other stars taking part in the project include John Lydon, the singer with Public Image Ltd and former Sex Pistols frontman, Brian Eno, and Steve Mason of The Beta Band. The 2011 recording session took place on the 34th anniversary of the Sex Pistols' original protest. Orbital's main man Paul Hartnoll told BBC News: ""We've been asked to be part of the recording, basically, of re-enacting that moment, and all the participants in the recording are not singing on the track."" He said the recording was about ""making a point"" about the state of the UK. ""We've recorded the backing track, which is the Pistols' backing track, but nobody's singing on it. And the reason for that is that our generation doesn't have a voice. Our generation doesn't have anything to say. The people in charge haven't got a clue."" Suggs from Madness told BBC News why he got involved. ""For me, the Sex Pistols' 'God Save the Queen' in 1977 was one of the most important records of my teenage years,"" he said. ""It was a two-fingered salute to everything that was happening, the ridiculous week-long jubilee, and we've got something similar this year. ""And so I think it's important that we do it again and, if we do it again, then we should do it in the same way, just in silence."" Public Image Ltd singer John Lydon said the current state of the UK was more of a ""joke"" than it was in the 1970s. ""Anybody who thinks they have a voice, doesn't,"" he said. ""The country's a joke… It's worse than it was in '76. There's nothing."" ""So I think we should be very quiet, let's make a bloody noise with silence. I think it's a brilliant idea.""

Monmouthshire and Newport get 30 new electric car points,"A new scheme will provide free installation to 20 businesses, thanks to funding from the EU, Welsh Government and Monmouthshire council. Ten more will be installed in most Monmouthshire town centre car parks. That means the number of public electric car points in the county will increase by more than 30. Monmouthshire County Council's climate change and transport cabinet member, Cllr Jane Pratt, said: ""I'm really excited that we are able to offer this scheme to businesses and residents in Monmouthshire. ""This council is committed to tackling the climate emergency and reducing our carbon footprint and this scheme is one step towards encouraging and supporting the use of electric vehicles in Monmouthshire."" The scheme is open to any business in Monmouthshire and is funded by the EU Interreg NWE project - Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Across Borders (E-STOR). Firms only need to pay for the electricity used and can charge a small fee to customers to recoup some of the costs if they wish. Newport City Council has also announced it will be installing 30 new electric car charging points as part of the Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle Infrastructure Scheme (ULEVIS).

"The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers","The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers Thursday evening's opening episode on BBC One attracted an average of 5.5 million viewers, a 26.3% share of the available viewing audience. The launch of the 17th series marked a significant decline in viewership compared to the previous year, when 6.4 million viewers tuned in for the premiere. The decline in ratings does not come as a complete surprise, as many reality TV shows have experienced a drop in viewership in recent years. However, the margin of the decline for The Apprentice is notable, particularly given the popular appeal of Lord Sugar as the show's host. The Apprentice has long been a staple of British television, known for its cutthroat challenges and revealing insights into the world of business. Previous contestants have gone on to establish successful careers in their respective industries, including Tim Campbell, the series' first winner, and Carina Lepore, who recently served as CEO of fashion brand Missguided. Despite the decline in viewership, BBC One remains confident in the show's appeal. A spokesperson for the channel said, ""The Apprentice is a hugely popular format that continues to attract a loyal audience. We are excited to see what this series has in store, with Lord Sugar putting 18 new candidates through their paces."" The series launch drew a mixed reaction from critics. Some praised the fresh faces and competitive challenges, while others criticized the lack of innovation and the predictable nature of the format. Despite the contrasting opinions, The Apprentice remains one of the most talked-about shows on British television. Its ability to spark conversation and inspire viewers to pursue their own business aspirations ensures its enduring relevance. As the series progresses, it remains to be seen whether it can regain some of the viewership lost in the opening episode. With Lord Sugar's sharp wit and the determined contestants' ambitions on display, The Apprentice is sure to provide plenty of entertainment and business insights in the weeks ahead.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

He said: ""Elise was only 21 when she was on the Titanic, and she went on to live to the grand old age of 94. ""When the ship hit the iceberg she was in bed, and she recalled that the chief steward came round telling all the passengers that they should get dressed, get their lifebelts on and go on deck. ""When they got on deck they were told to go back down to their cabins and wait for further instructions. ""At no time did anyone tell them to get into the lifeboats.

""It was a real last-minute thing, and she was one of the last people to get into a lifeboat. ""She said the crew were really good.

Shetland Super Puma crash: Co-pilot's actions 'crucial' to survival,"Super Puma passengers Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, died when the aircraft came down on its approach to Sumburgh Airport in August 2013. The helicopter was operated by CHC Scotia, part of Canadian Helicopter Corporation, and carrying oil workers to and from North Sea platforms when it crashed. An investigation, published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), found the co-pilot's ""decisive and timely"" actions ""materially contributed to the survival"" of the 14 other passengers and crew on board. The AAIB report found that the helicopter had been flying too fast and low on its approach to Sumburgh. The co-pilot, who was in control of the aircraft, took over from the captain seven minutes before it crashed. The report said the co-pilot had been ""placed in a difficult position"" because of the captain's ""inadequate supervision"" and ""limited guidance"". It said he had been ""faced with a situation where he was receiving incorrect and ambiguous guidance from the captain, who appeared to have become confused and disorientated"". The co-pilot had been able to take control of the aircraft and avoid obstacles as it came in to land, but had been unable to prevent it from crashing into the sea. The AAIB said the co-pilot's actions had been ""crucial"" to the survival of the other passengers and crew on board. The report also made a number of recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and CHC Scotia, including improving training for pilots and providing them with better support.

Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care,"Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care By Nick Triggle Health correspondent Nearly 1.85 million requests for support were made last year, but just over 650,000 people received help. Councils have been warning for a number of years that they are struggling to meet demand for the care that people are legally entitled to. This is putting a huge strain on the system, with some people having to wait years for the help they need. The figures were obtained by BBC News through a Freedom of Information request to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. They show that the number of requests for care has increased by 20% in the past four years, while the number of people receiving help has only increased by 5%. This means that councils are now rejecting two-thirds of requests for care. The vast majority of requests for care come from older people, who need help with things like washing, dressing and eating. But councils are also seeing an increasing number of requests from younger people, who may have disabilities or mental health problems. The Local Government Association said the figures were ""deeply concerning"". ""Councils are facing an impossible task in trying to meet the growing demand for care,"" said David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board. ""We need the government to urgently provide us with more resources to help us meet this demand."" The government has said it is committed to providing more funding for social care, but it has not yet said how much this will be. In the meantime, councils are having to make difficult decisions about who to provide care for. This is often a matter of life and death, as people who are not receiving the care they need are more likely to end up in hospital or even die. The BBC has spoken to a number of people who have been refused care by their council. One is a 65-year-old woman with dementia who lives alone. She needs help with washing, dressing and eating, but her council has told her that she is not eligible for care. Another is a 40-year-old man who has a learning disability. He needs help with managing his finances and finding work, but his council has told him that he is not eligible for care. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs care receives it. But the figures obtained by BBC News suggest that this is not happening.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Japan frees Chinese boat captain amid diplomatic row,"Japan had accused Zhan Qixiong of deliberately ramming two patrol vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. China said his detention was ""illegal and invalid"", and cut off ministerial-level contacts with Japan. The release came after four tense months of heightened diplomatic tensions. The captain's release came after a Japanese court rejected a request to extend his detention without charge and ordered his immediate release. Zhan Qixiong returned to China, where he was greeted as a hero by Chinese officials and the media. The incident that led to the captain's arrest took place near the Senkaku Islands, which are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. The islands are known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. Both countries have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the islands for decades. The dispute over the islands is a major source of tension between Japan and China. In recent years, there have been frequent incidents involving Chinese fishing vessels and Japanese patrol boats in the area. The release of Zhan Qixiong is likely to ease tensions between the two countries, but the underlying dispute over the islands remains unresolved. The release of Zhan Qixiong has been met with mixed reactions in Japan. Some people have welcomed the move, arguing that it will help to improve relations between Japan and China. Others have criticized the government for releasing the captain, arguing that he should have been prosecuted for his alleged crimes. The Japanese government has said that it will continue to work with China to resolve the dispute over the Senkaku Islands. However, it is clear that the issue will continue to be a source of tension between the two countries for the foreseeable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Solar Impulse aeroplane reaches Ohio,"The zero-fuel aircraft arrived in Dayton at 21:56 local time (01:56 GMT) having flown from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 1,113km journey took pilot Andre Borschberg about 16 hours to complete, a relatively short hop for the aircraft that has already covered more than 35,000km on its round-the-world journey. The aircraft is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells, which charge batteries that drive the propellers. It has a wingspan of 72m (236ft) - wider than a Boeing 747 - but weighs only 2,300kg (5,100lb) - less than a family car. The plane's progress has been delayed by bad weather and technical problems, but the team is now hoping to complete the circumnavigation by the end of July. The aircraft is scheduled to make its next stop in Pennsylvania, before crossing the Atlantic to Europe. If successful, it will be the first time a solar-powered aircraft has flown around the world. The plane's journey has been closely followed by environmentalists, who see it as a symbol of the potential for renewable energy. The aircraft's success could help to inspire the development of new technologies that could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, some critics have questioned the environmental benefits of the aircraft, arguing that it is too expensive and impractical to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels. They also point out that the aircraft's batteries are made from lithium, which is a finite resource. Despite the criticism, the Solar Impulse team remains confident that the aircraft can make a significant contribution to the fight against climate change. The team hopes that the aircraft's success will inspire people to think differently about energy and encourage them to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Virgin's Unity plane rockets skyward,"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Chief pilot, Scotsman Dave Mackay, and co-pilot, American Mike Masucci, took the vehicle to almost 89km (55 miles) during a four-hour flight. It was the first of five powered test flights planned over the next few months. ""It was the most exhilarating moment of my career,"" Mike Masucci said. ""We've just changed the world,"" Dave Mackay commented. Virgin Orbit is the brainchild of Sir Richard Branson who says the goal is to ""open up space for business"". His company is a relative latecomer to the emerging small satellite launch market. But it has the backing of big money investors and is also aiming to bring down the cost of access to orbit. ""We're committed to making this a routine service,"" said Will Pomerantz, the Virgin Orbit chief technology officer. ""Our plan is to fly every month; there's a huge market for this."" The launches will be conducted from various locations around the world, depending on the needs of the customers. The LauncherOne rocket is carried aloft under the wing of a specially modified Boeing 747 aircraft. Once the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and position, the rocket is released and fires its engine to propel itself and its payload into orbit. This ""air-launch"" system is less expensive than the more traditional method of launching rockets from a ground-based pad. Virgin Orbit says it can provide flexible and responsive launch services, putting satellites into orbits ranging from a few hundred kilometres up to 5,000km in altitude. The company is also developing a reusable first stage for its LauncherOne, which will further reduce the cost of operations. ""We're at the very beginning of a new era in space launch,"" said George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit. ""The key is to reduce the cost of launching small satellites into orbit. That's what will open up the market to new technologies and applications."" The first commercial flight of Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne is targeted for later this year.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Steve Easterbrook's new McJob,"By Jamie Robertson Presenter, BBC World News The former Watford Grammar School boy is seen as the man who revitalised the group's UK business. And McDonald's needs a turnaround specialist as it struggles with its image, assailed by criticism over everything from its food to its role in creating obesity and paying low wages. Steve Easterbrook says he's not concerned about the naysayers. He told me that he's a ""big believer"" in the power of the McDonald's brand. ""It's one of the most recognised brands in the world,"" he said. ""And it's a brand that people have a lot of emotional attachment to."" Easterbrook says he's going to focus on improving the quality of the food, making the restaurants more welcoming, and providing better customer service. He also wants to make the company more environmentally friendly. But it won't be easy. McDonald's is facing competition from a growing number of fast-food chains, and it's also struggling with changing consumer tastes. People are increasingly looking for healthier, more sustainable food options. Easterbrook is aware of the challenges, but he's confident that he can turn things around. He says he's a ""results-oriented person"" and he's not afraid to make tough decisions. ""I'm not here to tinker around the edges,"" he said. ""I'm here to make a difference."" Only time will tell if Easterbrook can deliver on his promises. But he's certainly not short of ambition. He wants to make McDonald's the ""world's best quick-service restaurant"". If he succeeds, it will be a remarkable turnaround for a company that has been struggling for years. But if he fails, it will be another nail in the coffin for one of the world's most iconic brands. Steve Easterbrook has also pledged to improve McDonald's UK operations, saying he wants to make the company ""the best place to eat and work"" in the country.

Church of England to keep Amazon shares despite Welby criticism,"The Church Times has revealed Amazon was among the 20 biggest global investments by the Church last year. A statement from the CofE said it considered ""a range of factors"" in its investment decisions, including companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. The Church's ethical investment policy is designed to ""promote the flourishing of all creation and the common good,"" a spokesperson said. ""This includes investing in companies that are committed to reducing their carbon footprint, respecting human rights, and promoting economic justice."" Amazon has been criticized by some for its labor practices, environmental record, and tax avoidance strategies. However, the Church said it believes that ""engaging with companies"" is the best way to encourage them to improve their ESG performance. ""We believe that by investing in companies like Amazon, we can have a positive impact on their behavior and encourage them to make changes that will benefit all of society,"" the spokesperson said. The Church's decision to keep Amazon shares has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the Church for its ethical stance, while others have accused it of hypocrisy. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has previously criticized Amazon for its labor practices. In 2018, he said that the company's ""ruthless"" treatment of its workers was ""a scandal."" However, the Church said that it is ""confident"" that Amazon is committed to improving its ESG performance. ""We will continue to monitor the company's progress and engage with them on issues of concern,"" the spokesperson said. The Church of England is one of the world's largest investors, with a portfolio worth around £10 billion. It has been investing in ethical funds since the 1980s. In recent years, the Church has come under increasing pressure to divest from companies that are involved in activities that are harmful to the environment or society.

UK unemployment rises to 1.7m,"That is the first increase since the May-July period of last year. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1%, which is still near historic lows. However, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by 10,400 to 1.2 million. The rise in unemployment was driven by a fall in the number of people in employment, which decreased by 56,000 to 32.5 million. This was the first quarterly fall in employment since the three months to May 2020. The number of people economically inactive, which includes those who are not working and not looking for work, increased by 25,000 to 8.9 million. This was driven by an increase in the number of people looking after family or home, which rose by 44,000 to 1.4 million. The latest figures come as the UK economy faces a number of challenges, including rising inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank of England has raised interest rates to try to curb inflation, but this is also expected to slow economic growth. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said that the government was ""monitoring the situation closely"" and was ""committed to supporting people through this challenging period."" He said that the government would ""continue to provide targeted support to those most in need, and help people into work."" The TUC General Secretary, Frances O'Grady, said that the rise in unemployment was ""a worrying sign"" that the UK economy was ""heading in the wrong direction."" She said that the government needed to ""do more to support people who are losing their jobs"" and to ""boost the economy."" The CBI Director-General, Tony Danker, said that the rise in unemployment was ""a reminder that the cost of living crisis is having a real impact on businesses and individuals.""

""We were to keep the steps clear but we were not to check the mezzanine area. That was not our domain,"" he said. ""If someone was loitering there, then somebody else would have to move them on."" The inquiry heard that Abedi had been seen ""milling around"" on the mezzanine level for 45 minutes before the explosion.

What are you waiting for?"" The inquiry also heard from Showsec supervisor Paul Wright, who was in charge of the evacuation of the arena after the explosion. Mr Wright said that he had not been trained in how to deal with a bomb attack. ""I'm not a security expert. I'm just a doorman,"" he said. ""I know what I'm supposed to do for crowd control, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do for a bomb attack.""

Why are young Indians killing themselves?,"Soutik Biswas Delhi correspondent If new research is to be believed, a disturbingly high number of young Indians are losing the courage to live. A study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal finds that suicide is the leading cause of death among 15 to 19-year-olds in India. In 2016, an estimated 25,000 children and teenagers died by suicide in India. That's more than the number of people who died in road accidents in the same year. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bengaluru, found that the suicide rate among young Indians has been increasing steadily over the past decade. In 2001, the suicide rate among 15 to 19-year-olds was 8.8 per 100,000. By 2016, it had increased to 15.3 per 100,000. The researchers found that there are a number of factors that are contributing to the high suicide rate among young Indians. These include: Academic pressure: Indian students are under a lot of pressure to succeed in school. They are often expected to get good grades in order to get into a good college and get a good job. This pressure can lead to anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Family problems: Many young Indians experience family problems, such as divorce, domestic violence, and financial difficulties. These problems can also lead to anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Social isolation: Young Indians who feel isolated and alone are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts. This can be due to a number of factors, such as bullying, cyberbullying, and discrimination. Mental health problems: Young Indians who have mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, are at an increased risk of suicide. The study's authors say that the high suicide rate among young Indians is a serious public health problem. They call for more research to be done on the causes of suicide among young Indians and for more effective suicide prevention programs to be developed.

"Volkswagen's UK sales fell in October, says SMMT","The motor group has been embroiled in controversy over the level of emissions from its diesel and petrol cars. Sales of VW branded cars fell 9.8%, Skoda dropped 3% and SEAT was down 8.3%. The figures show that registrations of new cars dropped for the third month in a row in October, down 1.7% compared with the same month last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Overall, diesel cars accounted for just over half of all new vehicles, down from 53% a year ago. The number of petrol cars registered rose 4.3%, while demand for hybrid and electric models increased 17.7%. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""October's figures continue the recent trend of a slowing new car market, with consumer and business confidence hit by a range of factors. ""These include ongoing economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and high fuel prices."" The drop in VW sales comes as the German automaker faces a barrage of lawsuits and investigations over its use of emissions-cheating devices in its diesel cars. The company has admitted to installing software in millions of vehicles that allowed them to pass emissions tests, even though they emitted far more pollutants than allowed under the law. The scandal has damaged VW's reputation and led to a sharp decline in sales. In the UK, VW sales fell 20% in 2016, the biggest drop of any major automaker. In addition to the emissions scandal, VW is also facing challenges due to Brexit. The company has warned that a no-deal Brexit would disrupt its supply chain and could lead to job losses in the UK. Despite the challenges, VW remains one of the largest automakers in the world. The company is investing heavily in new technology, including electric vehicles and autonomous driving. VW is also hoping to rebuild its reputation by investing in sustainability and social responsibility.

India raises withdrawal limit as rupee anger mounts,"Customers can now withdraw up to 2,500 rupees a day from cash machines, rather than 2,000, the finance ministry said. Many cash machines are not working because they have run out of money. The move comes after days of protests across India over the government's shock decision to ban high-denomination banknotes. The ban has caused chaos for ordinary Indians, who rely on cash for most transactions. Long queues have formed outside banks as people try to exchange their old banknotes for new ones. Some people have been forced to sleep on the streets overnight to secure a place in the queue. The government has said that the ban is necessary to combat corruption and tax evasion. However, critics say that it is causing more harm than good. The opposition Congress party has called for the government to reconsider the ban, saying that it is punishing ordinary Indians for the crimes of a few. The government has also been criticized for not doing enough to prepare for the ban. Many banks have not been able to cope with the demand for new banknotes, and there have been reports of cash machines being empty. The central bank has said that it is working to improve the situation. However, it is likely to take some time for the cash shortage to ease. In the meantime, the government has urged people to use electronic payments instead of cash. However, many people in India do not have access to electronic payment systems. The ban on high-denomination banknotes has also had a negative impact on the Indian economy. Businesses have reported a sharp decline in sales, and some factories have been forced to close.

"Objective reality exists, says UK minister Matt Hancock","By Brian Wheeler Political reporter Matt Hancock said it was ""something of a disappointment"" that he had to state publicly that ""objective reality exists"". But it was ""incredibly important"" to hang on to that principle in the face of ""post-truth"" and ""alternative facts"". The health secretary made his comments in an article for The Times Red Box. In it, he said: ""The very idea that objective reality may not exist is not only dangerous but also self-defeating. ""If we cannot agree on what is true, how can we possibly hope to make progress on anything? ""Whether it's climate change, the economy or even just the day-to-day decisions we make in our own lives, we need to be able to rely on a shared understanding of the world around us."" Hancock said that the rise of social media had made it easier for people to live in ""echo chambers"", where they only encounter views that they agree with. This, he said, had led to a ""fragmentation of our society"" and made it harder to have ""meaningful conversations"" about important issues. He called on people to ""be more open to hearing different perspectives"" and to ""challenge our own beliefs"" from time to time. ""It's not always easy, but it's essential if we want to live in a society where we can all understand each other,"" he said. Hancock's comments come at a time when there is growing concern about the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. A recent study by the University of Oxford found that people are more likely to believe false information if they see it shared by their friends and family on social media.

Tunisia attack: Sousse killer Rezgui 'trained in Libya',"Most of the 38 people killed in the Sousse attack were British tourists. Tunisia is a popular destination for UK holidaymakers. Rezgui is thought to have been radicalised while in Libya, where he is believed to have joined an affiliate of the so-called Islamic State group. He returned to Tunisia in March and began planning the Sousse attack. The Tunisian interior ministry official said that Rezgui had been in contact with the two men who attacked the Bardo National Museum in Tunis in March, killing 22 people. The official said that the three men had been in contact with IS militants in Libya. The IS group has claimed responsibility for both the Bardo and Sousse attacks. The Tunisian government has declared a state of emergency and has vowed to crack down on terrorism. The government has also said that it will investigate how Rezgui was able to travel to Libya and return to Tunisia without being detected by security forces. The UK Foreign Office has warned British nationals against travelling to Tunisia.

Lend Lease chosen to build Wrexham super-prison,"Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said the project would be a ""massive boost"" for the local economy with half of the jobs available going to local people. Work is expected to start in August, creating around 1,000 jobs during construction. The prison is due to open in 2022 and will house 2,106 male prisoners. It will be the first new prison to be built in Wales since HMP Berwyn opened in Wrexham in 2017. Lend Lease has been chosen to build the prison after a competitive tender process. The company has a track record of delivering major infrastructure projects, including the Olympic Village for the London 2012 Games and the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The prison will be built on a 130-acre site on Wrexham Industrial Estate. It will be a Category C prison, which means it will house prisoners who are assessed as being at a low risk of re-offending. The prison will have a range of facilities, including workshops, a gym, a library, and a healthcare centre. It will also have a dedicated unit for prisoners with mental health problems. The Ministry of Justice said the new prison is needed to help reduce overcrowding in the prison system. The prison population in England and Wales has been rising for a number of years and is now at its highest level since the early 1990s. The new prison will also help to create jobs and boost the local economy. Lend Lease has pledged to use local suppliers and contractors wherever possible. The project has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said the prison would be a ""major investment"" in the area. ""This is a great opportunity for Wrexham,"" he said. ""It will create jobs, boost the economy, and help to reduce overcrowding in the prison system."" Wrexham County Borough Council leader Mark Pritchard said the prison would be a ""positive development"" for the area.

Fear suppressing neurons found,"By Melissa Hogenboom Science reporter, BBC Radio Science These inhibitory neurons ensure that a neutral memory of a context or location is not contaminated by an unpleasant event occurring at the same time. The team says their work could help to explain why sometimes people have difficulty forgetting traumatic experiences. The research is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""We can all recall a time when we experienced something unpleasant, like a bad meal or a car accident,"" said Dr Andrea Lobo, from the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. ""Normally, we would remember that experience as being associated with that place or time, but in some cases, that link can become too strong and we end up associating the place or time with the negative experience, even when we are not there. ""This is what happens in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), when people have flashbacks and nightmares about a traumatic event."" The team wanted to understand how the brain prevents this from happening normally. They used optogenetics, a technique that allows them to control the activity of specific neurons using light, to inhibit a type of neuron in the hippocampus of mice. The hippocampus is a brain region involved in memory formation. They found that inhibiting these neurons caused the mice to associate a neutral place with an unpleasant experience, even though they were not in that place at the time. ""This suggests that these neurons are normally responsible for preventing us from making these kinds of incorrect associations,"" said Dr Lobo. ""Our findings could help to explain why some people have difficulty forgetting traumatic experiences. In these people, these inhibitory neurons may not be working properly, which could lead to the development of PTSD."" The team now hopes to investigate whether these neurons are also involved in other memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. ""We know that memory loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but we don't know exactly what causes it,"" said Dr Lobo. ""It's possible that these inhibitory neurons could be involved, so we want to investigate this further.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Global dip in renewable energy investment,"By Mark Kinver Environment reporter, BBC News It said investment fell for the second year in a row because of cheaper technology, but also as a result of uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report, from the UN Environment Programme and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, found that 65% of global renewable energy markets are now cost-competitive compared with fossil fuels. This has caused a sharp fall in investment in new projects, particularly wind and solar, which have become less profitable. But concerns over energy security and the need to tackle the climate crisis have led analysts to warn that clean energy investment needs to be ramped up, not reduced. ""In the midst of a global energy crisis and climate emergency, new investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is simply out of step with reality,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP. ""We need to move towards a new energy economy that is more equitable and sustainable."" The report found that investment in renewable energy in China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, fell by 17% in 2022 to $92.6bn. This is due in part to the country's zero-Covid policy, which has disrupted supply chains. But investment also fell in Europe, the second largest market, by 24% to $55.6bn. This is due to the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has made energy prices more volatile and created economic uncertainty. The US, however, bucked the trend, with investment in renewable energy increasing by 31% to $65.5bn. This is due in part to the Biden administration's support for clean energy, as well as the growing demand for electricity from renewable sources. Despite the overall decline in investment, the report found that the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is still growing. In 2022, renewable energy accounted for 29% of global electricity generation, up from 26% in 2021. This is due in part to the falling cost of renewable energy technology, as well as the increasing demand for clean energy from businesses and consumers. The report's authors said that the world is still on track to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But they warned that investment in renewable energy needs to be accelerated in order to meet these goals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
British bluebells 'have advantage over Spanish bluebells',"By Helen Briggs BBC News The introduced Spanish variety has lower fertility and is unlikely to wipe out the native plant, according to genetic tests. The Spanish bluebell has been spreading rapidly across the UK, particularly in woodlands. It has larger blue flowers than the native bluebell and flowers around two weeks earlier. Some experts have expressed concern that the Spanish bluebell could eventually outcompete the native plant. However, the new research suggests that the native bluebell has a significant advantage. The scientists compared the fertility of the two species in the laboratory. They found that the Spanish bluebell produced fewer seeds than the native bluebell. They also found that the Spanish bluebell seeds were less likely to germinate and grow into seedlings. The researchers say that their findings suggest that the native bluebell is unlikely to be wiped out by the Spanish bluebell. ""Our results suggest that the native bluebell is likely to be able to persist alongside the Spanish bluebell,"" said Dr. Richard Ennos, one of the researchers from the University of Edinburgh. ""This is good news, as the native bluebell is an important part of our natural heritage."" The researchers say that their findings do not mean that the Spanish bluebell is not a threat to the native plant. They say that the Spanish bluebell could still have a negative impact on the native bluebell population, for example by reducing the number of pollinators available to the native plant. However, the researchers say that their findings do provide some reassurance that the native bluebell is not likely to be wiped out by the Spanish bluebell.

UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan,"The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers more than £85m. That included £78m for two vessels that were never used and remain tied up in Belfast Lough. The Department for Transport (DfT) told the National Audit Office (NAO) it chartered the ferries ""to provide additional resilience"" in case there was disruption at Channel crossings after Brexit. But the NAO said there was a ""lack of clarity"" about what resilience meant and whether the procurement process represented value for money for the taxpayer. The report also found that the DfT had not put enough effort into considering how the ferries would be used, which led to delays and inefficiencies. For example, the DfT had not considered whether the ferries would need to be modified to meet UK regulations, which delayed their deployment. The NAO said the DfT had now taken steps to improve its ferry procurement process, but it said there was ""more to do"" to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. The DfT said it was ""disappointed"" with the NAO's findings, but it accepted the recommendations and was working to implement them. The department said it had ""learned lessons"" from the ferry procurement process and was ""confident"" that it would be better prepared for any future no-deal Brexit. The NAO's report comes as the UK government is preparing for the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. The government has said it will ""do everything necessary"" to ensure that the UK is ready for a no-deal Brexit, including chartering additional ferries. However, the NAO's report suggests that the government may need to do more to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely on Brexit preparations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sugababe changes 'hard on Amelle',"By Natalie Jamieson Newsbeat entertainment reporter It was announced on the band's website that 25-year-old Amelle would be taking time out at the end of the girls' current Get Sexy tour for personal reasons. Jade, Keisha and Heidi say they ""completely support her decision"". But Amelle's decision to take time out has made me think - is she going to be back? Could this be the first step towards the end of the Sugababes? They're one of the most successful girl bands ever. They've had a string of hits since they first got together in 1998. But they've had their troubles over the years. Mutya Buena left in 2005. Then Heidi Range took over from her. Amelle replaced Keisha in 2009. And now Amelle's decided to step away. I've spoken to some of the fans who've been following the Sugababes' career for years. Amelle is the fourth different member who's sung on their songs. ""It's just a bit weird,"" said 16-year-old Charlotte. ""I feel like I've got to learn new names and faces all the time."" Another fan, Lucy, said: ""It's not fair on the fans to keep changing the line-up."" But despite the changes, the Sugababes have kept going and have had plenty of hit records. ""They've always managed to reinvent themselves, so I'm sure they'll be fine,"" said one fan called James. However, I don't think it's as simple as that. I think the Sugababes are at a crossroads. If Amelle does decide to leave, it could be the end of the band as we know it. The other girls could try to find another replacement. But would it be the same? Or they could decide to call it a day. Whatever happens, I think it's fair to say that the Sugababes will never be quite the same again. Here are some of the reactions from fans on Twitter and Facebook: ""I'm so disappointed that Amelle is taking time out from the Sugababes. I hope she comes back soon."" - @Sugababesfan ""I'm not surprised that Amelle is taking time out. The band has been through a lot of changes in recent years."" - @Sugababesfan2 ""I think the Sugababes are at a crossroads.

Carney says house price boom is 'manageable',"He said the bank is acting in a ""graduated and proportionate way"" to stop the housing market getting out of control. He told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the strength of the recovery has taken the MPC by surprise, but added that most of the data suggest the economy is expanding ""close to its sustainable rate"". Carney also said the bank would keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% as long as inflation remained in check, below the bank's target of 2%. Economists are divided over whether the rise in house prices is sustainable. Some say the prices are being driven up by investors from abroad, and that prices are likely to fall in the next few months. Others say that the strong economic recovery will continue to support demand for housing, and that prices will continue to rise. The Bank of England has been criticised for its handling of the housing market. Some critics have accused the bank of doing too little to prevent a unsustainable rise in house prices. Others have said that the bank should not interfere in the housing market at all. Carney's comments come as the latest official figures show that house prices in the UK rose by 10.2% in the year to March, the biggest annual increase since August 2010. The average house price is now £223,000. The rise in house prices has been fuelled by a number of factors, including low interest rates, a shortage of new homes, and a strong economic recovery. However, there are concerns that the rise in house prices is unsustainable, and that a sharp correction could lead to a slowdown in the economy. The Bank of England has said it is monitoring the housing market closely, and that it will take action if it believes that the market is getting out of control.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Asbestos: Cwmcarn High School could reopen after scare,"Cwmcarn High School in Caerphilly county closed in October after a report said asbestos posed a threat to health. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is an ""essentially uncontaminated school"" after new tests. A section of the school's roof was replaced over the weekend, and air tests on Monday came back clear. The school will now reopen on Tuesday with the HSE confirming that the school is safe. Caerphilly council said it had worked ""tirelessly"" to reopen the school as soon as possible. The council said: ""The school will be open as normal for pupils and staff to return to on Tuesday, January 16th. ""We would like to thank all parents, pupils, and staff for their patience and understanding during this time."" The news comes as a relief to parents and pupils who have been forced to travel to other schools since Cwmcarn High closed. One parent, who did not want to be named, said: ""It's great news that the school is reopening. My son has been having to travel to another school and it's been a nightmare. ""I'm just glad that it's all sorted out now and he can go back to his own school."" The HSE said it had carried out a number of tests at the school and found that there was no asbestos contamination. A spokesman said: ""The HSE has completed a number of air tests at Cwmcarn High School and the results have come back clear. ""We are satisfied that the school is an essentially uncontaminated school and that it is safe for pupils and staff to return."" The council said it would continue to work with the HSE to ensure that the school remains safe. A spokesman said: ""The council will continue to work closely with the HSE to ensure that the school remains a safe environment for pupils and staff.

US slavery: How is America marking the 400th anniversary?,"Why is the date significant? In 1619, a ship arrived in an English settlement in what is now the US state of Virginia, carrying some 20 captured Africans. It's the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans in what would become the United States. The 1619 Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning initiative from The New York Times Magazine, has drawn attention to the lasting impact of slavery in the US. It has argued that the country's history has been shaped by slavery and its legacy in ways that are often overlooked. To mark the 400th anniversary, a number of events and initiatives have been planned. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is hosting a year-long exhibition entitled 'Slavery and Freedom'. The exhibition tells the story of slavery in the US from its beginnings to the present day. Other events include a national day of remembrance on August 20, the date when the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia. There will also be a series of lectures, workshops, and community events. The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the US is an important opportunity to reflect on the country's history and the legacy of slavery. It is a chance to learn from the past and to work towards a more just and equitable future. Here are some additional perspectives on the 400th anniversary: Ibram X. Kendi, author of 'How to Be an Antiracist': ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to reflect on the deep and enduring legacy of slavery in our country. It is a time to recommit ourselves to the fight for racial justice and to create a more just and equitable society for all."" Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of 'The 1619 Project': ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to remember the millions of people who were enslaved, the brutality they endured, and the lasting legacy of slavery. It is also a time to celebrate the resilience of the African American community and the progress we have made towards racial justice."" Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative: ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to confront the dark chapters of our history and to recommit ourselves to the pursuit of justice. It is a time to remember the victims of slavery and to work towards a day when all Americans are treated with dignity and respect.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The Prodigy and Slash top Friday Download Festival bill,"By Del Crookes Newsbeat reporter at Download Festival The dance band were 20 minutes late for their set but made up for it with more than an hour of their infectious beats and wild stage show. Fireworks exploded, dancers in animal costumes roamed the stage and frontman Keith Flint showed off his trademark wild hair during tracks such as Breathe and Firestarter. But it was the rockers who seemed to be the favourites of the Friday night crowd - whether it was US band Stone Sour, Welsh rockers Bullet For My Valentine or Los Angeles metallers Slipknot. Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor wore full make-up and sang and screamed his way through the likes of Get Inside and Through Glass. He even jumped down into the crowd and walked across the barrier at one point. Bullet For My Valentine sang about tears, pain and anger - but got the whole crowd moving with tracks like Your Betrayal, Tears Don't Fall and Scream Aim Fire. As night fell, Slipknot took to the stage in their trademark masks. The crowd went wild for Duality, Psychosocial and Wait And Bleed during a hard-hitting set featuring smoke, flames and a giant stage show. Frontman Corey Taylor said the crowd had been ""f awesome"". ""There's fans out there that know the lyrics better than we do, they sing the songs louder than we do and there's nothing more beautiful,"" he said. ""We are Slipknot, you are our family and we love you."" The day had begun with the return of thrash metal legends Megadeth. They played a crowd-pleasing set featuring Hangar 18, Symphony of Destruction and Holy Wars. They closed with Peace Sells, with frontman Dave Mustaine saying: ""We'd like to thank you all for coming out here and supporting live music - because without you there would be no us.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Redcar Regent Cinema demolition inspires memory 'flood',"Redcar's Regent Cinema opened as a music hall, the Pavilion, in 1928, and was where Larry Grayson, performing under stage name Billy Breen, coined his ""shut that door"" catchphrase. It closed in 1989, and the memories of its halcyon days flooded back to many as demolition work began this week. Photos from the cinema's heyday show a glamorous main entrance with staff in smart uniforms greeting filmgoers. Michael Grainge, who lives in Redcar, was nine when he first visited in 1967. ""I can remember the Central Cafe next door and the old-fashioned bar where you could get lemonade and a packet of crisps,"" he said. ""I think they sold ice cream during the intervals but you had to have a dish with an ice cream wafer in it."" His memories, he said, ""came flooding back"" on Monday when he visited the former building. Others shared their memories on social media after seeing the work begin on Monday. ""I can remember sitting on my dad's knee, he would normally fall asleep and I would get away with eating the whole box of chocolates,"" said one. ""My ex-husband worked there when he was at school, he said the boxes full of film canisters were huge and he would try and stand in them,"" said another. It held 2,200 people in its prime and was also used to host bingo, dances and concerts. Dave Robb, 63, said he saw everyone from Showaddywaddy to Chas and Dave perform there. ""I have seen films with mates and taken my kids when they were young,"" he said. ""It was part of the area's history and culture - it's sad to see it go.""

Coronavirus: Almost 900 Manchester Airports Group job cuts,"Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said 465 roles were under threat at Manchester Airport as well as 376 at London Stansted Airport and 51 at East Midlands Airport. It confirmed it is ""beginning a consultation process with trade unions and employee representatives"". Charlie Cornish, MAG's chief executive, said: ""These are deeply regrettable steps. We know there is more to do and we're committed to emerging from this crisis as a stronger and more sustainable business, but right now our focus is on making the right decisions to protect as many jobs as possible in the future."" It comes after airports across the UK have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of passengers flying plummeting. MAG had already announced plans to cut 1,250 jobs in August, and it has now confirmed that the majority of those roles will be lost. The group said it ""will explore all possible options"" to avoid compulsory redundancies and said it was ""committed to supporting all affected colleagues"". John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow Airport's chief executive, said plans to cut 25% of its workforce were ""very difficult"" but ""are essential"". He said: ""We are doing everything we can to protect as many jobs as we can and to support our people through this very difficult time. We will continue to work with our colleagues, the government and the wider aviation industry to ensure the UK maintains a world-class aviation sector."" The cuts come as the aviation industry continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this week, British Airways announced plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs, while Ryanair said it could cut up to 3,000 jobs. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry could lose $84bn (£63bn) this year, and that passenger numbers could fall by 55%.

Falkirk vote-rigging claims: Jack Straw calls for new inquiry,"On BBC2's Daily Politics, the Labour MP said there was ""a sufficient case... for there to be further questions that will need to be dealt with"". The Sunday Times newspaper has reported that Unite thwarted the party's initial investigation. The union, which is the Labour Party's biggest financial backer, has denied any wrongdoing. Unite has said it ""provided the Labour Party with all the information that was available to us"" and that it ""has never sought to influence the outcome of any investigation"". The Labour Party has said it will ""co-operate fully"" with the Electoral Commission's investigation. The allegations of vote-rigging centre on the Falkirk constituency, where Unite was accused of signing up hundreds of new members in order to influence the selection of the Labour candidate. The party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has already suspended three members in connection with the allegations. The Electoral Commission has said it will ""consider whether there are grounds for a full investigation"". The allegations have come at a difficult time for the Labour Party, which is already facing questions about its links to trade unions. The party has been accused of being too close to the unions, and of allowing them to have too much influence over its policies and decision-making. The allegations of vote-rigging have further damaged the party's reputation and raised questions about its ability to run a fair and democratic selection process. The party is now under pressure to act decisively to deal with the allegations and to restore confidence in its ability to run a fair and democratic selection process. If the allegations are proven to be true, it could have serious consequences for the Labour Party. The party could be fined or even suspended from taking part in elections. The allegations could also lead to a loss of confidence in the party from the public. The party is already facing a challenge from the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the allegations of vote-rigging could make it even more difficult for the party to win back voters in Scotland. The Labour Party is now facing a major test of its leadership. The party needs to act decisively to deal with the allegations of vote-rigging and to restore confidence in its ability to run a fair and democratic selection process.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Grenfell Tower final death toll stands at 71,"The number of victims includes baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, the day the 24-storey blaze broke out. The final death toll announced by the Metropolitan Police on 13 July marks a somber and tragic milestone in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. Each life lost represents an irreplaceable member of the community. As the families and loved ones of the victims continue to mourn, the outpouring of support and solidarity has been overwhelming. Vigils, fundraisers, and community events have been organized to honor those who perished and provide comfort to the bereaved. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the focus is now on ensuring that the victims are not forgotten and that their legacy lives on. One way of doing this is through the creation of a permanent memorial to remember those who lost their lives. In addition, there is a need for a thorough review of building regulations and fire safety measures to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. The Grenfell Tower fire has exposed vulnerabilities in the system, and it is essential that lessons are learned and changes are made to enhance the safety of high-rise buildings. The road to recovery for the Grenfell Tower community will be long and challenging. However, the collective efforts of the community, local authorities, and the wider society will be crucial in supporting the survivors and ensuring that the victims are remembered with dignity and respect. The Grenfell Tower fire has had a profound impact on the lives of countless people. It has shattered families, destroyed homes, and left a deep scar on the community. But amidst the grief and loss, there has also been an outpouring of love, compassion, and determination to rebuild. As London and the world remembers the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, it is essential to reflect on the lessons learned and to work tirelessly to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.

Female Islamic clerics in Indonesia issue rare child marriage fatwa,"The fatwa, which is not legally binding but will be influential, was issued after a three-day congress of female clerics in the country. The clerics urged the government to raise the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 16 to 18, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Indonesia has ratified. Child marriage is a serious problem in Indonesia, with an estimated 1.2 million girls married before the age of 18. The practice is particularly prevalent in rural areas and among poor families. Child marriage has a number of negative consequences for girls, including increased risk of dropping out of school, domestic violence, and early pregnancy. The fatwa issued by the female clerics is a significant step towards addressing the problem of child marriage in Indonesia. The fatwa states that child marriage is ""haram"" (forbidden) under Islamic law, and that it should be abolished. The fatwa also urges the government to take steps to prevent child marriage, such as raising the legal age of marriage and providing education on the harmful effects of child marriage. The fatwa has been welcomed by many human rights activists and child protection organizations. However, it is likely to face opposition from conservative religious groups, who argue that child marriage is permitted under Islamic law. The Indonesian government has not yet responded to the fatwa. However, the government has previously indicated that it is committed to addressing the problem of child marriage. In 2019, the government launched a national strategy to end child marriage by 2030. The fatwa issued by the female clerics is a significant step towards ending child marriage in Indonesia. However, it is important to note that the fatwa is not legally binding, and that the government will need to take further steps to address the problem. The government should consider raising the legal age of marriage, providing education on the harmful effects of child marriage, and working with religious leaders to change attitudes towards child marriage.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
German nurse jailed for life for murdering patients,"The man, identified as Niels H, 38, was convicted of two counts of murder and attempted murder. He told the court last week he had acted on impulse and apologised. Presiding Judge Sebastian Uebele said Niels H showed ""no empathy"" for his victims and that the ""brutal coldness"" of his crimes left him with no choice but to impose a life sentence. The court heard how Niels H had killed two patients in his care at a hospital in Delmenhorst, near Bremen, in 2021. He injected one patient with a lethal dose of medication and suffocated the other with a pillow. He also attempted to kill a third patient, but the victim survived. Niels H was arrested shortly after the third incident. During his trial, Niels H admitted to the killings but claimed he had not planned them. He said he had been feeling overwhelmed and stressed at the time and had acted on impulse. However, the prosecution argued that Niels H had carefully planned the murders and had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"". In his closing statement, Niels H apologized for his actions and said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the pain he had caused. However, Judge Uebele said that Niels H's apology was ""too little, too late"" and that he had shown no genuine remorse for his crimes. The judge also said that Niels H's actions had ""shattered the trust"" between patients and healthcare professionals. ""You have destroyed the reputation of a noble profession,"" Judge Uebele said.

Trump appoints China critic Peter Navarro to trade post,"He will lead the White House National Trade Council, and serve as director of trade and industrial policy. Mr Navarro advised Mr Trump during his election campaign, and is a prominent critic of China. Mr Navarro is the author of several books on trade and economics, including ""Death by China"" and ""The Coming China Wars."" In these books, he argues that China is a threat to the US economy and that the US needs to take steps to protect its workers and businesses. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to be seen as a sign that Mr Trump is serious about taking a tough line on trade with China. Mr Trump has already threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, and has said that he wants to renegotiate the trade deficit between the two countries. Mr Navarro's appointment is also likely to be seen as a sign that Mr Trump is willing to appoint people with strong views, even if those views are controversial. Mr Navarro is a vocal critic of the current global trading system, and he has advocated for a more protectionist approach. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to be welcomed by some businesses and workers in the US who believe that the US needs to take a tougher stance on trade with China. However, it is also likely to be met with criticism from free trade advocates, who argue that tariffs and other protectionist measures will harm the US economy. The appointment of Mr Navarro is the latest sign that Mr Trump is taking a different approach to trade policy than his predecessors. Mr Trump has already withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has threatened to renegotiate other trade agreements. It is unclear whether Mr Trump's approach will be successful, but it is clear that he is willing to try something new. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to have a significant impact on US trade policy.

His husband, Jeff Lowe, told TMZ that Maldonado-Passage was ""very sick"" when he was taken to hospital but was now recovering. ""He had pneumonia in both lungs and fluid around his heart,"" Lowe said. ""They put him on oxygen and they put him on antibiotics."" Lowe said that Maldonado-Passage was ""not doing well"" at first but was now ""much better"". ""He's still very weak but he's getting better,"" Lowe said. ""He's eating and drinking and he's talking."" Maldonado-Passage's illness comes as the United States experiences a surge in Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, the country reported more than 250,000 new cases, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. The surge in cases has led to renewed calls for people to get vaccinated and boosted. Lowe said that Maldonado-Passage had not been vaccinated against Covid-19. ""He didn't believe in the vaccine,"" Lowe said. ""He thought it was a hoax."" Lowe said that he hoped Maldonado-Passage's illness would serve as a warning to others about the dangers of Covid-19. ""I hope this is a wake-up call for people,"" Lowe said.

Apple and Amazon deny China hack claims,"Apple and Amazon have both responded publicly to claims made by Bloomberg Businessweek which described the cyber-attack. ""There is no truth to these claims,"" said Apple's spokesperson Fred Sainz. Amazon's spokesperson also denied the accusations, saying that the company ""has found no evidence to support this claim."" The original report, published on November 13th, 2022, alleged that hackers linked to the Chinese government had managed to implant malicious chips into Supermicro server motherboards. These chips, the report claimed, were designed to spy on the companies' internal networks and steal sensitive data. The report cited anonymous sources who claimed to have knowledge of the investigation into the hack. However, both Apple and Amazon have denied these claims, and no evidence has been presented to support them. The Chinese government has also denied any involvement in the hack. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said that the allegations were ""unfounded"" and ""irresponsible."" The claims made in the Bloomberg Businessweek report have been met with skepticism by some experts. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the report's claims were ""far-fetched."" ""There is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese hackers have implanted malicious chips into Supermicro server motherboards,"" Lewis said. ""This is a very serious accusation, and it would be irresponsible to make it without any evidence."" Other experts have also raised questions about the report's methodology. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said that the report relied too heavily on anonymous sources. ""The report does not provide any evidence to support its claims,"" Scott-Railton said. ""It is based entirely on anonymous sources, which makes it very difficult to verify."" The Bloomberg Businessweek report has sparked a great deal of concern and debate. However, it is important to note that the claims made in the report have not been substantiated by any evidence. Until more evidence is presented, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not the hack actually occurred.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Avocado prices at record high due to reduced harvests,"Avocado prices have risen to a record due to surging global demand and reduced harvests from major producers Mexico, Peru and California. A 10-kilogram box of Hass avocados from Mexico's major wholesale producer sells for around 530 pesos (£21.78; $30.22) - more than double last year's price. The global avocado market is worth an estimated $11 billion (£8.7bn), and Mexico is the world's largest producer, accounting for 60% of the global supply. However, in recent months, production in Mexico has been hit by a combination of factors, including drought, disease and organized crime. As a result, wholesale prices in Mexico have risen by more than 100% in the past year, and retail prices in the United States and Europe have also risen sharply. In the United Kingdom, a single avocado can now sell for as much as £2 in supermarkets, and some restaurants have even taken the fruit off their menus. The surge in prices has been particularly painful for countries like Mexico, where avocados are a staple food. In the Mexican state of Michoacan, which produces around 80% of the country's avocados, the avocado industry is worth an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.9bn) a year. However, as the avocado crisis continues, there are signs that the market may be starting to cool down. In recent weeks, wholesale prices in Mexico have started to decline slightly, and some analysts believe that the worst may be over. ""The market is starting to stabilize,"" said Juan Carlos Anaya, the head of the Mexican Avocado Producers and Packers Association. ""We're still facing a number of challenges, but we're confident that we'll be able to weather the storm."" For consumers, the high prices of avocados are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. However, there are some things you can do to save money. Buy avocados in bulk from a wholesaler or farmers market. Look for avocados that are slightly underripe and ripen them at home. Use avocados in recipes that call for small amounts, such as guacamole or avocado toast. Consider using other fruits, such as bananas or mangoes, as a substitute for avocados in some recipes.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The new iPhone: Your Comments,"Apple shows off iPhone4 I will be buying one when my contract ends for my last iPhone. Why? Because with all this change in technology that is being created it will be nice to have a phone that can keep up with it all. I am a big fan of Apple products and have been for many years. Their products work well and fit into my lifestyle. I’m not really one who likes to constantly be buying a new phone because the technology is better. I like a phone that features all that I need and works well for me that is why sticking with Apple is really the best fit because of these reasons.  Some may say that the iPhone4 is not that different from the iPhone3 and that you really don’t need to upgrade. The look of the phone is different but the only major difference I see is the camera. The iPhone4 has a 5-megapixel camera compared to the iPhone3 3-megapixel. To some, this may not be a big difference but for the photos I take with my phone, this will make a big difference. I’m not one to carry around a camera and the quality of some of the pictures taken with the iPhone3 were not the best. Just the other day I was at my niece's dance recital and the pictures of her came out blurry because of the lighting. With the iPhone4 5-megapixel camera, I am hoping this will no longer be an issue. Also, with the iPhone4 featuring the front-facing camera this will come in handy as well. I can take self-portraits or use the FaceTime like my friend does. She loves the FaceTime feature because she gets to see her daughter while she is out of town. Even though the iPhone4 is a nice upgrade to the iPhone3 I still feel the price is a little high. I am still going to buy the iPhone4 but I am going to wait until my contract is up with my current iPhone3. My contract ends in October so I will be getting my iPhone4 then. In the meantime, I will continue to use my iPhone3 until then. I feel that getting the iPhone4 will be a great addition to my technological world and will be well worth the wait until my contract ends.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

World's biggest opera houses defend ENO after funding cuts,"They described the ENO as ""a showcase for talent and innovation"" and ""one of the UK's greatest cultural ambassadors"" in a letter to the Financial Times. Signatories included the general directors of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, La Scala in Milan, the Vienna State Opera, and the Paris Opera. The letter comes after the ENO announced plans to cut 20% of its workforce and close its London Coliseum base for two years as part of a major restructuring. The company said the cuts were necessary to secure its long-term financial future. However, the signatories of the letter argued that the cuts would have a devastating impact on the ENO and the wider opera world. They said the ENO was ""a vital part of the cultural landscape of the UK and beyond"" and that its closure would be ""a great loss to the arts community and to audiences around the world."" The letter also called on the UK government to provide more support for the ENO. They said the government had a ""responsibility to ensure that the UK's cultural institutions are able to thrive"" and that the cuts to the ENO were ""a short-sighted decision that will damage the UK's reputation as a cultural powerhouse."" The ENO is one of the UK's leading opera companies. It was founded in 1931 and has a long history of producing high-quality opera productions. The company has a strong track record of developing new talent and has been instrumental in the careers of many of the world's leading opera singers. The ENO's closure would be a major loss to the UK's cultural landscape. It would also have a negative impact on the wider opera world. The company is a major commissioner of new operas and its productions are often seen as a benchmark for quality. The UK government has a responsibility to ensure that the UK's cultural institutions are able to thrive. The cuts to the ENO are a short-sighted decision that will damage the UK's reputation as a cultural powerhouse.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Veterans' war memories given life in 'virtual' tour,"Poppyscotland has teamed up with games developers at Abertay University on the unusual Remembrance project. Headsets take users on a simulated tour of the Lady Haig poppy factory in Edinburgh where objects trigger a series of personal audio testimonies from veterans, providing a moving and immersive experience of their war memories. The project, called Poppy Stories, uses virtual reality (VR) technology to allow users to explore the factory and hear firsthand accounts from those who have served in the armed forces. The project was funded by Poppyscotland and developed in partnership with Abertay University. Users are given a headset and are taken on a simulated tour of the poppy factory. As they move around the factory, they can see objects that trigger a series of audio testimonies from veterans. The testimonies are personal and moving, and give users a unique insight into the experiences of those who have served. One veteran who took part in the project was Alistair Moffat, who served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He said: ""It was a great experience to be able to share my story with others in such a unique way. The VR technology really brought my memories to life and I hope that it will help people to understand the sacrifices that have been made by those who have served."" Another veteran who took part in the project was John Brown, who served in the Royal Navy during the Falklands War. He said: ""I was very impressed with the Poppy Stories project. It is a very immersive and powerful way to share the stories of veterans. I hope that it will help people to understand the challenges that veterans face when they return home from war."" The Poppy Stories project is a unique and moving way to commemorate Remembrance Day. It is a powerful reminder of the sacrifices that have been made by those who have served in the armed forces, and it gives users a unique insight into their experiences.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan blasphemy: Gunman shoots accused dead in court,"By Secunder Kermani BBC News, Islamabad He had been facing charges for allegedly claiming to be a prophet. Blasphemy is legally punishable by death. Asif Mumtaz was shot dead in the courtroom as he spoke to the judge. The gunman ran toward him and fired three bullets into his chest. Others tried to restrain the attacker, who fired his weapon again, while Mr. Mumtaz lay on the floor, motionless. Wearing a white shalwar kameez and a white hat, the assailant was apprehended after police arrived and used tear gas to disperse the courtroom. Mr. Mumtaz was a manager at the company in Rawalpindi, where he had a reputation for being a quiet and decent man. But in recent months, he had been accused of sending blasphemous messages on WhatsApp, and video clips emerged of him purportedly claiming to be a prophet. Though Mr. Mumtaz had denied the allegations, he was arrested in August. His case had caught the attention of extremist religious groups. As the trial began, activists from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party gathered outside the court complex. They had threatened to launch a protest movement if Mr. Mumtaz was released. The TLP is a far-right group that has often taken up cases involving blasphemy. Its supporters often use violence and intimidation to try to influence the courts and punish those accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The Interior Minister, Rana Sanaullah, said the shooter was a ""terrorist,"" and an investigation had been launched to determine if he had any accomplices. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of those accused of blasphemy in Pakistan and the potential for mob justice. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue, and anyone accused of it can face threats from religious extremists. Often, cases are based on flimsy evidence, and accusations can be used to settle personal scores. In 2022, a Christian man was killed by a mob after he was accused of ripping pages from a Quran. In another case, a university student was sentenced to death for allegedly posting blasphemous content online. The government has condemned the killing of Mr. Mumtaz and has vowed to take action against those responsible. However, human rights groups say that more needs to be done to address the issue of blasphemy and protect those accused of it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Arson arrest of boy, 15, as dogs killed in Manchester kennels fire","Police said the number of animals that have died is expected to rise. Four crews were at the scene of the blaze, which broke out at about 19:00 BST in Ashton, Tameside. Greater Manchester Police said a 15-year-old boy had been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. He remains in custody for questioning. Residents told the BBC they had heard ""loads of bangs"" and seen flames shooting 50ft in the air. One neighbour, Tracy Morton, 54, described it as ""an inferno"" and said it had spread quickly through the building. ""My husband called the fire brigade - his first words were, 'The kennels are on fire',"" she said. ""There were loads of bangs going off, you could hear the dogs yelping, you could hear them all screaming."" Jack McDermott said he lived a few streets away and heard ""an almighty bang"". ""I looked out the window and I saw a huge plume of black smoke and I could see the kennels were completely alight,"" he said. ""Everyone was panicking, people were running out on to the street."" Jade Ashworth, who lives on a nearby street, said she went to the scene with her partner and saw ""lots of panic and flames everywhere"". ""There was a really bad smell of burning and there was lots of black smoke,"" she said. ""I could see dogs jumping out of the building, they were just throwing themselves out of the windows."" The fire service has urged people to avoid the area as crews continue to work at the scene. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham described it as a ""terrible tragedy"" and said his thoughts were with the animal owners. ""I know there are animals in there, how many we don't know at this stage,"" he said. ""But this will be a devastating blow to the owners of those dogs and I want to offer my deepest condolences."" The RSPCA said it had been called to the scene and was urging members of the public not to attend the area. It said anyone concerned about their pet should contact the local authority, which is responsible for providing assistance to animals in such incidents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Does Russian-language Siri have a problem with gays?,"By BBC Trending What's popular and why A video posted earlier this week showing a conversation in Russian between Siri and a man who identifies himself as gay has provoked some controversy. In the video, the man asks Siri a series of questions about homosexuality, to which Siri responds with answers that could be interpreted as homophobic. For example, when the man asks Siri ""What do you think about gays?"" Siri responds with ""I don't know what you mean"". When the man asks ""Do you think gays are sick?"" Siri responds with ""I don't know what you mean"". The video has been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube and has sparked a debate about whether or not Russian-language Siri has a problem with gays. Some people have argued that Siri's responses are simply a reflection of the homophobic views that are still prevalent in Russian society. Others have argued that Siri's responses are more indicative of a lack of understanding about homosexuality than homophobia. Apple has not yet commented on the video, but it is worth noting that Siri is a voice-activated assistant that is designed to learn from its users. This means that Siri's responses will likely become more sophisticated over time. In the meantime, it is important to remember that Siri is not a person and that its responses should not be taken as a reflection of Apple's views on homosexuality. However, the video does raise some important questions about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, it is important to consider how we can ensure that it is used to promote tolerance and understanding, rather than division and hate. In the United States, Siri has been praised for its inclusiveness. In 2016, Siri was updated to include same-sex couples in its responses to queries about relationships. For example, if you ask Siri ""Who is my wife?"" Siri will now respond with ""Your wife is [wife's name]."" It is unclear why Russian-language Siri does not have the same level of inclusiveness as its English-language counterpart. However, it is important to note that Apple is a global company and that its products must be adapted to the cultural norms of each country in which they are sold. In Russia, there is a long history of homophobia. In 2013, Russia passed a law banning the ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations"" to minors. This law has been widely criticized by human rights groups, who say that it has created a climate of fear and discrimination against LGBT people in Russia. It is possible that Apple's decision to make Russian-language Siri less inclusive is a reflection of the homophobic climate in Russia. However, it is also possible that Apple simply made a mistake in its programming. Whatever the reason, the video of the conversation between Siri and the gay man has sparked an important debate about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, it is important to consider how we can ensure that it is used to promote tolerance and understanding, rather than division and hate.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

US envoy Susan Rice admits Benghazi attack error,"UN Ambassador Susan Rice said there had been no attempt to mislead the public, but Republicans were unconvinced. After meeting Ms Rice on Tuesday, senators said they were troubled. Ms Rice had initially described the attack as a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, but it later emerged that it was a planned militant assault. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Republican Senator John McCain said that Ms Rice had ""repeatedly misled the American people"". He said: ""She has a very difficult time explaining her performance. I think she misled the American people."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that he was ""not convinced"" by Ms Rice's explanation. He said: ""I'm not convinced that she didn't intentionally mislead the American people. I think she's got a lot of explaining to do."" Ms Rice defended her actions, saying that she had relied on the best intelligence available at the time. She said: ""I did not deliberately mislead the American people. I never have and I never would."" The controversy over Ms Rice's comments has damaged her reputation and has put her nomination as Secretary of State in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has said that he still has confidence in Ms Rice, but it is unclear whether she will be able to withstand the Republican opposition to her nomination. The Benghazi attack has been a major political issue in the United States. Republicans have accused the Obama administration of mishandling the attack and of misleading the public about the circumstances surrounding it. The administration has defended its actions, saying that it has been transparent about the attack and that it has taken steps to prevent similar attacks in the future. The controversy over Ms Rice's comments is likely to continue until the full truth about the Benghazi attack is known.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Valve shuts down money laundering via CS:GO game,"In a statement, it said the game had been targeted by global cyber-criminals looking to ""liquidate their gains"". The thieves exploited the game's loot-gathering systems, which allow players to obtain virtual items that can be traded for real-world currency. Valve said that the criminals laundered the stolen money through Steam, its online platform for buying and selling games and in-game items. It said that the problem was ""serious"" and that it had been working with law enforcement to investigate the issue. Valve has not said how much money has been laundered through CS:GO, but it is estimated that the game has been used to launder millions of dollars. In one case, a group of criminals laundered $500,000 through the game. The criminals used a variety of methods to launder the money through CS:GO. One method was to purchase virtual items with stolen credit cards. The criminals would then sell the items for real-world currency on Steam. Another method was to create fake accounts and use them to trade virtual items with legitimate players. The criminals would then withdraw the proceeds from the fake accounts. Valve has taken a number of steps to combat money laundering through CS:GO. It has increased the number of moderators on Steam and has implemented a new system to detect suspicious transactions. Valve has also banned the use of third-party websites that allow players to trade virtual items for real-world currency. Despite Valve's efforts, money laundering through CS:GO is still a problem. The criminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit the game's systems. Valve is working with law enforcement to investigate the issue and is committed to stopping money laundering through its platform. The problem of money laundering through video games is not unique to CS:GO. Other games, such as World of Warcraft and Dota 2, have also been used to launder money. In 2017, a group of criminals laundered $10 million through World of Warcraft. Money laundering through video games is a serious problem because it allows criminals to hide their illegal gains. It also damages the reputation of the video game industry. Valve and other game companies are working to combat money laundering and are committed to making their platforms safe for players.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"A&E facing serious problem, health minister admits","Rising attendances have meant A&E units in England have started struggling to hit the four-hour waiting time target. The problem has got so bad that NHS England has pledged extra money to try to ease the burden. But what is behind the increase in people going to A&E, and what can be done to stop it? There are a number of factors that are thought to be contributing to the rise in A&E attendances. One is the ageing population, as older people are more likely to experience health problems that require emergency care. Another factor is the increasing number of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. These conditions can lead to complications that require urgent treatment. Another issue is that many people are using A&E as a substitute for GP appointments, which can be difficult to get. This is often because GP surgeries are oversubscribed, or because people do not want to wait for an appointment. Whatever the reason, the increase in A&E attendances is putting a strain on the NHS. In some cases, patients are having to wait for hours to be seen, and in some cases, they are being sent home without being treated. This is not only a problem for patients, but it is also a problem for the NHS, as it is wasting money and resources. There are a number of things that can be done to try to reduce the number of people attending A&E. One is to increase the number of GP appointments available. This could be done by increasing the number of GPs, or by making it easier for people to book appointments. Another option is to improve the care that is available in the community. This could include increasing the number of community nurses and social workers, or providing more support for people with long-term conditions. Finally, it is important to educate the public about the appropriate use of A&E. Many people do not realise that A&E is only for emergencies, and that there are other services available for less urgent health problems. The government has said that it is committed to reducing the number of people attending A&E. It has pledged to increase the number of GP appointments available, and to improve the care that is available in the community. It is also working to educate the public about the appropriate use of A&E. It remains to be seen whether these measures will be successful in reducing the number of people attending A&E. However, it is clear that something needs to be done to address the problem.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Fresh plans for Torfaen's 'British' site,"The 1,300 acre (526 hectares) brownfield site at Talywain, near Pontypool, called ""The British"" has been derelict for 30 years. In June 2007 a development company bought it. Now the first stage of a £200m plan to breathe new life into a huge former steelworks has been approved by Torfaen council. The demolition of 32 buildings is planned at the British site, followed by the construction of warehouses and offices. The first phase of the development is expected to create 500 jobs during construction and 1,000 permanent positions once the site is operational. If the development, which will be called The Pontypool Gateway, is completed in its entirety, 3,000 long-term jobs could be created. A developer's spokesman said the first phase was a ""significant milestone"" and that brownfield sites such as The British were ""attractive development opportunities"". He added: ""The Pontypool Gateway is set to create thousands of much-needed local jobs and will help boost the regional economy."" The leader of Torfaen council, Cllr Anthony Hunt, said: ""This is great news for Torfaen and will bring significant benefits to the area. ""The Pontypool Gateway development will create jobs, boost the economy and provide a major regeneration of a site that has lain empty for far too long."" The demolition work is expected to start in the coming months, with the first phase of the development completed by the end of 2023. The British steelworks was once a major employer in the area, but closed in the 1980s. The site has been derelict ever since, but the new development is expected to breathe new life into the area and create much-needed jobs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Boohoo warned over advertising real fur as fake,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint it received about a pom pom jumper being sold by the online retailer. Tests by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) found it contained real fur, despite Boohoo advertising it as a faux fur item. Boohoo has since removed the misleading information from its website and admitted ''an administrative error'' had been made. HSI said the case highlights the risks of ''mislabelling'' when a retailer sources products from around the world. Claire Bass, HSI's UK executive director, said: ''HSI's investigation has exposed a major problem within the online fashion industry - consumers being duped into buying real fur when they believe they are buying faux fur. ''Boohoo has been caught red-handed misleading customers. We hope this ruling sends a clear message to all retailers that this kind of mislabelling will not be tolerated and that consumers deserve honesty and transparency when making purchasing decisions.'' The ASA said Boohoo had not provided evidence to prove the jumper's fur was fake and that it considered the ad to be ''misleading''. It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and told Boohoo not to make similar claims in future unless it was able to provide evidence to back them up. A Boohoo spokesperson said: ''We are committed to ensuring that all of our products are clearly and accurately labelled. We have investigated this matter and believe that an administrative error was made in this instance. We have removed the misleading information from our website and taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again.'' The spokesperson added that the company prides itself on its animal welfare policy and that it does not tolerate the use of real fur in any of its products. The sale of real fur has been banned in the UK since 2003, but the import of fur from animals that have been farmed overseas is still legal. This means that some retailers may be able to sell real fur items as long as they are labelled correctly. However, HSI's investigation found that some retailers are using misleading labelling to sell real fur items as faux fur. This can be difficult for consumers to spot, as it can be hard to tell the difference between real and fake fur.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New electric trains approved after windscreens changed,"Train drivers' union Aslef had said the curved windscreen on the Class 385s were causing reflections of other signals at night.

""Forests act as a carbon sink, absorbing about a third of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning,"" said Julian Fox, a professor of forest science at the University of Edinburgh. ""They also play a major role in regulating the water cycle, providing a natural filter for our water and helping to prevent flooding."" The report calls for urgent action to protect the world's forests. ""We need to take a comprehensive approach to forest management, balancing economic, social and environmental considerations,"" said Ms Mueller. ""We also need to empower local communities to play a role in managing their forests. They have a vested interest in ensuring that forests are used sustainably for generations to come."" The UN report is a timely reminder of the importance of forests to our planet. As the world's population continues to grow, so too will the demand for food, fuel and other forest products. It is vital that we find ways to meet these demands without destroying our forests. The UN report provides a roadmap for how we can achieve this goal. It is now up to governments, businesses and individuals to take action to protect the world's forests for future generations.

Hollywood actor Jason Statham shoots SAS movie in Wales,"The Killer Elite is reportedly based on a book by explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes about the murder of SAS soldiers. Scenes featuring Statham were shot in the Brecon Beacons on Wednesday, supporting claims the film is based on a true story. The film, directed by Snowdonia-born Gareth Evans, also stars Dominic Cooper, Aden Young, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen. Locations included Merthyr Tydfil town centre, where filming took place at the Redhouse, a former department store, and the nearby former Crown pub. The production also filmed in Cardiff, with scenes shot at the city's central railway station. Other locations used include Fforest Fawr, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, and the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon, Torfaen. The Killer Elite is the second Statham film to be shot in Wales in recent years, following The Expendables 3, which was filmed in Newport and Cardiff in 2013. Statham is said to have been impressed by the locations and the crews he worked with in Wales, and is keen to return for future projects. The Killer Elite is expected to be released in cinemas in 2024. The film's producers have said they are confident that it will be a critical and commercial success, and that it will help to raise the profile of Wales as a filming location. The Welsh Government has welcomed the production of The Killer Elite in Wales, and said it is evidence of the country's growing reputation as a world-class filming destination. The government has provided financial support to the film through its Creative Wales scheme, which is designed to attract and support film and television productions in Wales.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cancer fight 'hampered in UK by stiff upper lip',"By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online Researchers, who surveyed nearly 20,000 adults in six high-income countries, said they found embarrassment often stopped people from discussing cancer symptoms with family and friends, or even seeking a diagnosis. The work, published in the BMJ, suggests that the UK lags behind other countries when it comes to what is known as ""cancer awareness"". ""Our research suggests that the 'stiff upper lip' attitude in the UK may be a barrier to earlier diagnosis and treatment of cancer"" said Dr Anne Johannson, a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences at King's College London. ""We need to find ways to encourage more open discussion about cancer, both within families and in wider society."" The survey found that people in the UK were less likely to discuss cancer symptoms with family and friends than people in other countries. They were also less likely to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer. This could be due to a number of factors, said Dr Johannson. ""One possibility is that the British are less likely to talk about their health problems in general,"" she said. ""Another possibility is that there is a stigma associated with cancer in the UK."" Whatever the reason, the impact of this ""stiff upper lip"" attitude could be significant. ""Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer is vital for improving survival rates,"" said Dr Johannson. ""If people are not aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer, or if they are embarrassed to discuss them, they may be less likely to seek help until it is too late."" The researchers say that there is a need for more public health campaigns to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage people to seek help early. ""We need to create a culture where people feel comfortable talking about cancer,"" said Dr Johannson. ""We need to make it clear that there is no shame in seeking help, and that early diagnosis and treatment can save lives."" In the meantime, there are a number of things that people can do to improve their cancer awareness. Get to know your own body and be aware of any changes. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer. Talk to your family and friends about cancer. Seek help from a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about cancer.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Bangladesh mass prayer event prompts alarm,"Local police chief Tota Miah told AFP news agency that 10,000 Muslims had gathered in Raipur town to pray ""healing verses"" from the Koran. But some eyewitnesses told the BBC the figure was closer to 30,000. A similar religious event in Pakistan last month was blamed for a spike in infections in the deeply conservative country. Bangladesh has reported more than 60,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country is now under its fifth week of a strict lockdown that has shut down all public and religious gatherings. On Thursday, the government said it would extend the stay-at-home order until 5 June, but the crowds in Raipur suggest that some people are growing weary of the restrictions. During the event on Monday, the crowd prayed together in a large field, with many people standing shoulder-to-shoulder and not wearing face masks. One resident, who asked not to be named, said he had been shocked to see so many people gathered together. ""There was no social distancing at all,"" he said. ""It's like people have forgotten about the virus."" The gathering has prompted alarm among health officials, who fear it could lead to a surge in infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of the potential for superspreader events, where a large number of people are infected by a single carrier. ""We are very concerned about this event,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general. ""It is exactly the kind of event that we have been warning about."" The Bangladesh government has said it will investigate the event and take action against anyone who violated the lockdown rules. ""We will not tolerate any violation of the lockdown,"" said Health Minister Zahid Maleque. ""We will take strict action against anyone who puts the health of the nation at risk.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

China: Limited victory for man in transgender dismissal case,"Mr C, who was born female but identifies and dresses as a man, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year. Despite fulfilling all the requirements for the job and receiving good performance reviews, he was fired after the centre found out about his gender transition. Mr C filed a complaint with the local labour arbitration authority, arguing that his dismissal was a form of sex discrimination. The arbitration authority rejected his complaint, but he appealed to the local court. In its ruling, the Guiyang Xixi District Court stated that the health centre had failed to prove that Mr C's gender identity was ""objectively inappropriate"" for the job. It also found that the centre had not provided any reasonable justification for dismissing him. However, the court stopped short of declaring Mr C's dismissal unlawful. It ruled that the health centre had acted ""disproportionately"" in dismissing him, but that it was not liable for damages because it had not acted ""intentionally"". Mr C's case is significant because it marks the first time a Chinese court has ruled in favour of a transgender person in an employment discrimination case. However, the decision also highlights the limitations of the country's anti-discrimination laws. While Chinese law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and gender identity, transgender people often face difficulties in accessing employment, healthcare and other essential services. Activists say that the law needs to be strengthened to provide more explicit protections for transgender people. ""This judgment is a small step forward but there is still a long way to go,"" said Xiao Tie, a transgender rights activist. ""We need to continue to raise awareness and fight for the rights of transgender people."" Mr C himself expressed disappointment with the court's ruling, saying that he felt it was ""only a partial victory"". He told the BBC that he is considering appealing the decision to a higher court. ""I was born in the wrong body, but I have the right to live my life as I choose,"" he said. ""I will not give up fighting for my rights.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Apple ordered to re-write 'inaccurate' Samsung statement,"Apple was forced on 18 October to publish a message making it clear that Samsung had not infringed the iPad's registered design. However Samsung complained the message was “inaccurate and not a sufficient remedy”. Now the High Court has agreed and has ordered Apple to publish a clearer version of the message. The court also ordered Apple to pay Samsung’s costs. Samsung had argued that the original message published by Apple continued to give the “false impression” that it had copied the iPad’s design. It complained that the message stated the ruling only applied to “the specific products in issue in the proceedings”. Samsung had wanted the message to make clear that the ruling applied to all of its Galaxy Tab products. Mr Justice Arnold agreed with Samsung’s arguments. He said Apple’s clarification was “insufficient” and that “the inaccuracy was likely to cause substantial and unjustifiable damage to Samsung”. He added that while Apple had complied with the court order to publish a message clarifying the court’s judgment, ""it has not complied with the spirit of the order"". Apple has now published a new message on its website which states: ""Samsung did not infringe Apple's registered design for the iPad."" The message also makes clear that the ruling applies to all of Samsung's Galaxy Tab products. Samsung has welcomed the High Court’s decision. In a statement, Samsung said: ""We are pleased with the court's ruling, which clarifies that Apple's original statement was inaccurate. We hope that this will finally put an end to this matter and allow us to focus on our business."" Apple has declined to comment on the High Court’s decision. The legal battle between Apple and Samsung has been going on for several years. In 2012, Apple won a landmark case in the US against Samsung, in which it was awarded $1.05bn (£657m) in damages. However, Samsung has since appealed against the ruling and the case is due to be heard by the US Supreme Court in 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Aberdeen sanitary product pilot to start across Scotland,"The Scottish government scheme - designed to tackle ""period poverty"" - was launched in July last year. The six-month pilot was continued in March, and has distributed free products to more than 1,000 women. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said the expansion was a ""key part"" of ongoing work to ensure ""no-one should have to go without essential items due to financial hardship."" The council areas involved in the latest phase of the scheme for six months are: South Lanarkshire, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Dundee, and Shetland. It follows the pilot in Aberdeen, where products were made available in 20 community locations such as libraries, leisure centres, and food banks. In North Lanarkshire, products were also made available in schools. A recent survey by Young Scot found that 20% of girls and young women aged between 14 and 21 said they had struggled to afford period products in the last year. It also found that 15% of respondents had missed school because they did not have access to period products. Charities have welcomed the scheme, but say more needs to be done. The Scottish Women's Rights Centre said the scheme was a ""positive step"" but urged the government to make it a permanent provision. The center also called for free products to be made available in more places, including workplaces, and for the government to tackle the ""stigma"" around periods. The Lib Dems said the scheme was a ""sticking plaster"" and called for the government to provide free sanitary products to all women in Scotland. Scottish Labour said the scheme was a ""welcome step"" but called for the government to do more to tackle the underlying causes of period poverty, such as low incomes and insecure work. The Scottish Conservatives said they were ""committed"" to tackling period poverty but did not specify what measures they would take. The Scottish government said it was ""committed"" to ensuring that everyone has access to free period products, and that it was working with partners to ""develop a long-term solution"" to period poverty.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Models from Gerry Anderson's The Investigator up for sale,"The speedboat and sports car were produced for the 1973 show The Investigator, which never made it beyond a pilot episode. The models, both fitted with Honda 50cc engines, are now being sold by Anderson Entertainment. The Investigator was a secret agent series that was to star James Franciscus as Kim Grant, an investigator for the World Security Bureau. The show was to be produced by Gerry Anderson, who was best known for creating Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. However, the show was never picked up by a network, and only the pilot episode was ever produced. The models of the speedboat and sports car that were used in the pilot episode have been in storage for many years, but are now being sold by Anderson Entertainment. The speedboat is a 10-foot-long model of a 30-foot Bertram 31 Bertram Cruiser. It is made of fiberglass and is powered by a Honda 50cc engine. The sports car is a 1969 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray model. It is made of fiberglass and is powered by a Honda 50cc engine. Both models are in good condition and are expected to fetch a high price at auction. Anderson Entertainment is selling the models as part of a larger auction of Gerry Anderson memorabilia. The auction will be held on November 18, 2023, at the Bonhams auction house in London. In addition to the speedboat and sports car, the auction will also feature other items from Gerry Anderson's shows, including models of Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. The auction is expected to attract a large number of collectors and fans of Gerry Anderson's work. Gerry Anderson was a British television producer and director who was best known for creating a number of popular science fiction television series, including Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. Anderson's shows were known for their use of marionette puppets, which were often used to create complex action sequences. Anderson died in 2012 at the age of 83.

New environmental watchdog to get legal teeth after Brexit,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Ministers say the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) will be an independent statutory body to safeguard environmental standards. It will have the power to take the government to court over failures to enforce environmental law and also intervene in planning decisions. However, it will not be able to take action over breaches that occurred before the UK left the European Union. The new watchdog will replace the EU's environmental governance system. When asked in the Commons about the scale of its legal powers, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""The OEP can take enforcement action against public authorities, including government departments."" He added: ""The OEP may also take enforcement action against private individuals or companies, but only if a public authority is involved in the alleged breach of environmental law."" The former Environment Secretary, Theresa Villiers, pledged to establish a ""world-leading"" environmental watchdog after Brexit. She said it would ""drive continuous improvement in environmental outcomes"". The new body will be headquartered in Bristol and have operating bases in London, York, Cardiff and Edinburgh. It will have a budget of £13.3m for the next financial year. The OEP's remit covers all environmental law, including air and water quality, waste management, biodiversity and climate change. It will also be able to initiate investigations and make recommendations to government about improving environmental law. The new body has been welcomed by environmental groups. The Wildlife and Countryside Link said it was ""a big step towards the UK having an independent watchdog that can hold government and public bodies to account for environmental failures"". However, some environmentalists have expressed concerns about the OEP's powers. The Environmental Investigation Agency said it was ""disappointing"" that the body would not be able to take action over historic breaches of environmental law. The OEP will be able to take on cases brought to it by members of the public. However, unlike the EU system, it will not be able to levy fines.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""I never expected so many people to be interested in my paintings."" Mr Chinnery, who works as a teaching assistant at the University of East Anglia, said he started the project as a way to challenge himself creatively. ""I've always loved painting, but I don't get much time to do it,"" he said. ""So, I thought this would be a good way to force myself to paint more regularly."" Mr Chinnery said he chooses the landmarks he paints based on their architectural interest or historical significance. ""I'm trying to capture the essence of Norwich,"" he said. ""I want to show people the beauty of the city and its rich heritage."" Mr Chinnery's paintings have been praised for their detail and accuracy. He said he spends several hours on each painting, working from photographs and sketches. ""I want to make sure that my paintings are as true to life as possible,"" he said. ""I want people to be able to recognize the landmarks I'm painting and to appreciate the beauty of the city."" Mr Chinnery said he has been surprised by the positive reaction to his paintings. ""I've had people tell me that my paintings have made them appreciate Norwich more,"" he said. ""That's really rewarding.""

Covid-19: Record day for UK vaccinations as total nears 9m,"As of Saturday a total of 8,977,329 people had received a jab, and 491,053 of those have had a second dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding each vaccine ""brings us one step closer to normality"". Experts say the latest figures show the UK's vaccination programme is among the most successful in the world. Some groups, including the over-80s and healthcare workers, have already received both doses of the vaccine, and the government is now working to offer the vaccine to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. The success of the vaccine rollout has been attributed to a number of factors, including the government's early investment in vaccines, the efficient deployment of the vaccines by the NHS, and the willingness of the public to get vaccinated. The government has said it is confident that the vaccination programme will have a significant impact on the spread of Covid-19, and that it will help to protect the most vulnerable members of society. However, some experts have warned that it is too early to say when the pandemic will end. They say that the virus could mutate, and that new variants could emerge that are resistant to the current vaccines. The government has said that it is monitoring the situation closely, and that it will take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public. In the meantime, the public is being urged to continue to follow the government's advice on social distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. The UK's vaccination programme is a major step forward in the fight against Covid-19. However, it is important to remember that the pandemic is not over yet.

Macron aide Alexandre Benalla to be dismissed after protesters beaten,"The action against Alexandre Benalla was taken after ""new facts"" emerged in the case, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday. Mr Benalla is being questioned over the footage of the May Day protests. The Elysee Palace said the new information was ""particularly serious."" It said Mr Benalla had been suspended since May 4, when the alleged assault took place. Mr Benalla, 26, is a close associate of Mr Macron and was filmed wearing a police helmet and beating a protester during a demonstration on May 1. He has admitted being present at the protest but denies assaulting anyone. The Interior Ministry has launched an internal investigation into the incident. The scandal has caused embarrassment for Mr Macron, who has been accused of being too close to his staff. It has also raised questions about the use of force by police during protests. Mr Macron has said he will not tolerate violence against protesters. ""I want to be very clear: violence is unacceptable, whether it comes from protesters or from the police,"" he said. The incident has also sparked a debate about the role of private security firms in policing protests. Mr Benalla was employed by a private security firm that was hired by the Elysee Palace to provide security for Mr Macron. Critics have questioned why a private security guard was allowed to wear police gear and intervene in a police operation. The Interior Ministry has said it will review the use of private security firms in policing protests. The scandal comes at a time when Mr Macron is facing a number of other challenges. His approval ratings have fallen in recent months, and he has been criticized for his handling of the economy and other issues. The Benalla scandal is likely to further damage Mr Macron's reputation and make it more difficult for him to implement his reforms.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Brit Awards 2018: Stars to wear white rose pins on red carpet,"By Mark Savage BBC Music reporter The show's organisers wrote to the head of every UK record label on Wednesday to inform them of the plan. The letter says performers, presenters and guests will be given a white rose pin to wear on the red carpet and on stage. The gesture has been endorsed by the UK's Music Managers Forum, the Featured Artists Coalition and the Musicians' Union. The Brit Awards are the UK's biggest music awards ceremony. They will be held at London's O2 Arena on 21 February. In their letter, the Brits organisers say: ""We would like to invite all those attending the event to wear a white rose pin as a symbol of solidarity, hope and peace. ""This is not a political statement, it is a human one. It is about recognising and celebrating the power of music to bring people together."" The white rose has long been a symbol of Yorkshire, and has been adopted by the county's cricket team and rugby league team. It has also been used as a symbol of hope and peace by anti-war campaigners. The Brit Awards have been criticised in the past for being too male-dominated. In 2018, only one female artist was nominated for the best album award. In response to the criticism, the Brits organisers have made a number of changes to the awards this year. They have increased the number of female judges, and have introduced a new category for female artists. The white rose pin is the latest in a series of initiatives designed to make the Brits more inclusive. The Brits are not the first awards ceremony to use a symbol of solidarity. At the 2018 Golden Globes, actresses wore black dresses to protest against sexual harassment and assault. At the 2019 Grammy Awards, musicians wore white roses to show their support for the Time's Up movement. The white rose pin is a powerful symbol of hope and peace. It is a reminder that music can bring people together, and that we can all stand up against discrimination and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zoom sees more growth after 'unprecedented' 2020,"The video conferencing company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (£2.66bn). The forecast pushed shares in the company up more than 6% in after-hours trading. The growth comes after a bumper year for Zoom in 2020, when the pandemic forced millions of people to work from home. In the past 12 months, the company's shares have increased in value by more than 500%. Zoom said its growth is being driven by businesses, which are increasingly using its services for internal meetings and customer calls. The company is also benefiting from the growing popularity of hybrid working, which allows employees to work from both the office and home. Zoom is not the only video conferencing company to have seen strong growth during the pandemic. Other providers, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Meet, have also seen a surge in usage. However, Zoom has been able to maintain its market leadership, thanks to its easy-to-use interface and reliable service. The company is also investing heavily in new features, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Analysts say that Zoom is well-positioned to continue growing in the years to come, even as the pandemic recedes. The company's focus on business customers and its strong track record of innovation are likely to help it maintain its market leadership. ""Zoom has become the de facto standard for video conferencing,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""The company has a strong moat around its business, and we expect it to continue to grow at a rapid pace in the years to come."" Zoom's growth is also being helped by the increasing adoption of cloud computing. Businesses are increasingly moving their applications and data to the cloud, which makes it easier for them to use Zoom's services. The company is also benefiting from the growing popularity of video conferencing in emerging markets. In the past year, Zoom has seen strong growth in countries such as India, Brazil, and China. Overall, Zoom is well-positioned to continue growing in the years to come. The company's focus on business customers, its strong track record of innovation, and the increasing adoption of cloud computing are all likely to help it maintain its market leadership.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: MPs debate pet theft law change amid lockdown rise,"They were debating two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt also presented a 10-minute rule bill, which, if approved, would see the creation of a new law on pet abduction. Mr Hunt said there had been a ""shocking"" increase in the number of pets being snatched from their owners - 2,438 dogs in the past year alone, according to police figures. ""Since the first lockdown alone, 50,000 cats and dogs were reported stolen to police, which is shocking and unacceptable,"" he said. ""Pet theft is a terrible crime that causes deep distress to owners. We must take action now, before more people fall victim to these ruthless criminals."" The petitions to the government also highlighted the distress caused to owners, with more than one in 10 saying the experience was ""traumatic"". ""The government must recognise the severity of this issue and give pet theft the attention it deserves,"" one petition said. ""Current laws are failing to deter pet thieves and are failing to protect innocent animals."" The government amended the Animal Welfare Act 2006, in 2018, to include a new offence of pet abduction, punishable by a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Mr Hunt said this was a ""step in the right direction"" but called for further clarification in law, to treat pet theft more seriously. The Petitions Committee, which considers e-petitions with more than 100,000 signatures, has also backed calls for better protection for pets. In a report, it said: ""The committee believes that pet theft should be a specific offence."" It recommended that the government review sentencing for pet theft, to ensure it is proportionate and reflects the severity of the crime. The committee also called for improved police training, better data collection on pet theft and more support for victims. The government has previously said it is considering the Petitions Committee's recommendations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Alcohol age rise plan rejected,"The SNP administration wanted to let local licensing boards ban off-licence sales to under-21s but the move was blocked by Holyrood's Equalities and Human Rights Committee. The motion was voted down by six votes to five following concerns about discrimination against young people. The plans sparked a fierce debate, with supporters arguing that they would reduce alcohol-related harm among young people. Opponents, however, claimed that they would unfairly penalise responsible young adults and would be difficult to enforce. The Scottish government said it was ""disappointed"" with the outcome of the vote and would continue to explore ways to tackle underage drinking. ""We are committed to reducing alcohol-related harm, particularly among young people,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will continue to work with stakeholders to develop and implement effective measures to achieve this."" The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the committee's decision, saying it was the ""right thing to do"". ""These plans would have unfairly targeted responsible young adults and would have been difficult to enforce,"" said Miles Briggs, the party's justice spokesman. ""We are pleased that the committee has listened to our concerns and rejected these proposals."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats also opposed the plans, saying they would have been ""counterproductive"". ""These proposals would have penalised responsible young adults and would not have been effective in reducing underage drinking,"" said Alex Cole-Hamilton, the party's health spokesman. ""We are pleased that the committee has rejected these plans."" The vote on the plans comes after a number of high-profile cases of underage drinking in Scotland. In 2017, a 16-year-old boy died after drinking a bottle of vodka. In 2018, a 14-year-old girl was hospitalised after drinking a bottle of wine. These cases have raised concerns about the availability of alcohol to young people in Scotland. The Scottish government has introduced a number of measures to tackle underage drinking, including minimum pricing for alcohol and a ban on the sale of alcohol to under-18s. However, the Scottish government has said that more needs to be done to reduce alcohol-related harm among young people. The plans to give local licensing boards the power to ban off-licence sales to under-21s were part of a wider package of measures to tackle the issue. The rejection of these plans by Holyrood's Equalities and Human Rights Committee is a setback for the Scottish government. However, it is likely that the government will continue to explore other ways to reduce alcohol-related harm among young people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

They said most customers now prefer to use online banking and mobile banking. The MPs said RBS's plans ""will have a detrimental impact on access to banking services in Scotland"". They said the closures would particularly affect vulnerable customers, such as the elderly and those in rural areas. The committee also said RBS had not properly consulted with its customers about the closures. They said the bank had not given customers enough notice of the closures, and had not provided them with enough information about alternative banking services. RBS said it was ""committed to supporting our customers through this transition"". The bank said it would provide customers with ""a range of support options"", including online and telephone banking, mobile banking, and access to community banking hubs. The committee said it was ""not convinced"" by RBS's arguments for the closures. They said the bank had not provided enough evidence to support its claim that customer behavior had changed dramatically. The committee also said RBS had not properly considered the impact of the closures on vulnerable customers. They said the bank had not provided enough information about how these customers would be able to access banking services after the closures. The committee said it was ""concerned"" about the impact of the closures on access to banking services in Scotland. They said the closures would particularly affect vulnerable customers, and that RBS had not properly consulted with its customers about the plans.

Polish bishops for total ban on Sunday shopping,"By News from Elsewhere....as found by BBC Monitoring ""Free Sundays are what all Catholics, non-Catholics and non-believers need,"" Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki told Polish Radio ahead of a meeting of the Bishops Conference on Friday. The influential church body is expected to issue a formal appeal for a law change to end Sunday trading. Poland's large supermarket chains are currently allowed to open on Sundays, but there are restrictions on the types of shops that can trade, and small, family-run businesses are banned from doing so. A government bill to impose a full ban on Sunday shopping was approved by the lower house of parliament in 2017, but later vetoed by President Andrzej Duda. The president said he wanted a ""reasonable compromise"", which would still allow some shops, like petrol stations and cafes, to open on Sundays. The issue is deeply polarising in Poland. Poorer and rural communities often support the ban, saying it protects family values and local businesses. But many city dwellers oppose it, arguing it restricts consumer choice and hurts businesses. Opinion polls show that Poles are roughly evenly split on the issue. The government has said it will not support a new ban without public backing. ""We're still looking at the arguments for and against,"" the family, labour and social policy minister, Elzbieta Rafalska, told the Tok FM radio station. ""It's a question of how we organise our work and free time. On the one hand, it's about the vitality of the economy, on the other, it's about the right to rest and a decent life."" The debate comes as Poland grapples with a labour shortage, with many businesses complaining they cannot find enough staff to work on weekdays. ""A ban on Sunday shopping would make it even harder to find staff, because the vast majority of retail workers are women with families, and they often need to work on Sundays to make ends meet,"" said Rafal Matusiewicz, of the Polish Chamber of Commerce. The ban is expected to be a key issue in next month's European Parliament elections. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which supports the ban, is expected to do well, but polls show that most Poles want the government to focus on other issues, such as the economy and healthcare.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: UK's already huge changes may just be the start,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor @bbclaurakon Twitter Whitehall had been monitoring and fearing the arrival of the coronavirus on these shores for many weeks. But when Boris Johnson told the nation on Sunday evening that the UK was moving to the ""delay"" phase of its response to Covid-19, it was clear that the moment had come and the precautions and social distancing measures that had previously been under consideration were now imperative. The government's scientific advisers had warned that without stepping up the response to ""delay"" the peak of the epidemic, even under the best-case scenario the NHS would be overwhelmed by a vast increase in the number of patients needing hospital treatment. There would have to be what the prime minister called ""very significant"" changes in people's lives and ""a very considerable change in the way we behave"". What does the delay phase involve? The government is now explicitly asking people to: Avoid unnecessary social contact Stay home if you have a high temperature or a new and continuous cough Work from home if you can Avoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, clubs and theatres. Schools are now closed, exams have been cancelled and people are being encouraged to self-isolate if they have underlying health conditions. The scale of this response is huge - while few people are yet to self-isolate, towns and cities across the UK are noticeably quieter, with pubs, restaurants and shops already reporting a significant drop off in trade. But the government has been clear that this may not be enough. The prime minister warned that if the public does not follow this advice, then ""no amount of NHS capacity"" will be enough. The next phase - ""contain"" - would involve even more draconian measures such as further restricting movement and closing down public transport. Could this be just the start? In fact, the cabinet has been discussing even tougher policies, including measures akin to a full-scale lockdown that would mean no one could leave their homes. While it has been decided not to put such measures in place at this stage, they could be revisited if the current social distancing measures do not have the desired effect. The prime minister's address to the nation on Sunday was notable for its sombre and direct tone - he warned that ""many lives will sadly be lost"" and that the government was ""seeking to slow the spread of the disease to reduce the number of lives lost"". The government knows the weeks and months ahead are likely to be the toughest in decades - the scale of the challenge is enormous. The coming weeks will be a test for the government and for society as a whole. If we do not follow the advice of the scientists and the government, the consequences will be catastrophic. It is time to take this seriously - our lives, and the lives of our loved ones, may depend on it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Yushchenko testifies against old Orange ally Tymoshenko,"Mrs Tymoshenko is being tried in Kiev on charges of exceeding her authority while prime minister, in signing a gas contract with Russia two years ago. If found guilty she could face a jail sentence of seven to 10 years. Mr Yushchenko said he had come to court ""not as a political opponent, but as a citizen"". His statement, however, turned into a scathing attack on his former ally, who he accused of being an authoritarian leader and of acting in her own interests at the expense of the country. He said the gas deal was ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"". Mrs Tymoshenko, who has denied all charges against her, accused Mr Yushchenko of giving false testimony against her for political reasons. She said he was trying to divert attention away from his own record in office, which she said had been a ""disaster"". The trial of Mrs Tymoshenko has been widely seen as politically motivated, and has drawn criticism from the West. The European Union has said it is ""deeply concerned"" about the charges against her, and has called for a fair trial. The United States has also expressed concern, saying the trial ""could potentially undermine Ukraine's democracy"". Mrs Tymoshenko is a charismatic and popular figure in Ukrainian politics. She served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and was a key figure in the Orange Revolution, which brought Mr Yushchenko to power in 2004. However, she has also been a controversial figure, and has been accused of corruption and authoritarianism. The trial of Mrs Tymoshenko is expected to last several months. It is seen as a key test of the Ukrainian government's commitment to democracy and the rule of law.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Greater Anglia apologises over London to Norwich train disruption,"Services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich were disrupted in both directions after a train stopped, blocking the line near Chelmsford on Tuesday evening. Some passengers reported being stuck on trains for up to two hours, with services being cancelled or delayed. Greater Anglia apologised for the disruption, saying it was caused by a ""technical fault"". The disruption began at around 7pm, with trains being held at stations between London Liverpool Street and Norwich. Passengers on the 17:40 service from Norwich to London Liverpool Street reported being stuck on the train for over two hours. One passenger, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""We're stuck on the train between Norwich and London Liverpool Street. ""We've been here for over two hours now, with no information from Greater Anglia. It's really frustrating."" Another passenger, who was on the 18:05 service from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, said: ""My train was cancelled, and I've been waiting for over an hour for the next train. ""I'm really disappointed with Greater Anglia. They need to do better."" Greater Anglia said it was ""sorry for the disruption caused to passengers"". A spokesman said: ""We are working hard to get services back up and running as quickly as possible. ""In the meantime, we are advising passengers to check our website or the National Rail Enquiries website for the latest information."" The disruption is expected to continue until the end of the night. Passengers are advised to check before they travel.

Dutch state liable for three Srebrenica deaths - court,"The men had been ordered to leave a UN compound run by Dutch peacekeeping forces when Bosnian Serb forces overran it. The ruling upheld an earlier decision by an appeals court in 2011. Considered Europe's worst massacre since WWII, 7,500 Muslim men and boys were killed in Srebrenica on 11th July 1995. The Dutch peacekeepers had been sent to protect the enclave but were outnumbered and outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs. The court found that the Dutch state was liable for the deaths of the three men because it had failed to take adequate measures to protect them. The ruling is a significant victory for the families of the victims, who have been fighting for justice for over 20 years. The Dutch government has apologized for the Srebrenica massacre and has paid compensation to the families of the victims. However, the ruling is the first time that the state has been held legally liable for the deaths. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the liability of states for the actions of their peacekeeping forces. In a statement, the Dutch government said that it ""deeply regrets"" the deaths of the three men and that it will ""study the ruling carefully"". The government also said that it is ""committed to continuing to work with the families of the victims and the international community to prevent such atrocities from happening again"". The Srebrenica massacre was a dark chapter in European history and the court's ruling is a reminder of the importance of accountability for such crimes. The ruling is also a victory for the families of the victims, who have finally seen justice done for their loved ones.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"JJB Sports in administration with 2,200 job losses","The administrators said they had managed to save 550 jobs after selling part of the business to Sports Direct. JJB's High Street presence is likely to be significantly reduced by the sale after Sports Direct revealed it only intended to keep 42 of the 180 stores, putting more than 1,600 jobs at risk. The deal, which was underwritten by Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, means JJB Sports will remain on the High Street, but only in a much smaller form. It also raises the prospect of Ashley becoming one of the most prominent figures on the UK High Street. JJB Sports' collapse into administration marks the latest casualty in a retail sector that has been battered by the recession. The company's demise follows hot on the heels of the collapse of Woolworths and Zavvi in the past year. Many retailers have been struggling as shoppers rein in their spending in the face of rising unemployment and falling incomes. At the same time, they have been hit by competition from online rivals like Amazon and Play.com. JJB Sports was founded in 1971 and grew rapidly during the 1990s and early 2000s. However, the company began to struggle in recent years as it faced increased competition from rivals like Sports Direct and JD Sports. The company's problems were compounded by the recession, which led to a sharp fall in consumer spending. The collapse of JJB Sports is a major blow to the UK High Street. The company was one of the largest sports retailers in the country, and its disappearance will leave a significant hole in the market. The closure of JJB Sports stores will also have a knock-on effect on other businesses in the High Street, as shoppers are less likely to visit areas where there are fewer shops. The collapse of JJB Sports is also a reminder of the challenges facing the retail sector. The sector is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs, increased competition, and changing consumer habits. As a result, many retailers are struggling to survive, and it is likely that we will see more high-profile casualties in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Northern Ireland earnings on the rise,"That means typical weekly pay rose from £500 to £521, or just more than £27,000 a year. Northern Ireland and the West Midlands experienced the largest gains in annual earnings growth at 11.4%, the ONS said. The data, which covers the period from April 2021 to March 2022, shows that average weekly earnings for full-time workers in Northern Ireland rose by £57 to £527. The increase in earnings is likely to be welcomed by many workers in Northern Ireland, who have been struggling with the rising cost of living. However, it is important to note that inflation is currently running at 9%, which means that real wages are actually falling. The ONS data also shows that there is a significant gender pay gap in Northern Ireland. Average weekly earnings for full-time male workers are £600, compared to £473 for full-time female workers. This means that women in Northern Ireland earn on average 21% less than men. The gender pay gap is a complex issue, and there are a number of factors that contribute to it. These include occupational segregation, where women are more likely to work in lower-paid sectors, and discrimination. The Northern Ireland government has said that it is committed to reducing the gender pay gap. In 2021, it launched a new strategy to tackle the issue. The strategy includes a number of measures, such as encouraging employers to adopt flexible working practices and providing support for women who want to return to work after having children. It is hoped that these measures will help to reduce the gender pay gap in Northern Ireland. However, it is likely to take some time before there is a significant change.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Donald Trump reverses plans for flavoured e-cigarette ban,"He announced plans for a ban in September, but reportedly decided not to enact it this month because of possible job losses and voter pushback. Thousands of lung injuries have been linked to vaping, and several deaths have also been reported. The industry says the illnesses could be caused by counterfeit or illicit products, or contaminated liquids used in refilling devices. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is continuing to investigate the illnesses. It has warned against using THC-containing e-cigarettes, but has not banned them outright. The ban on flavoured e-cigarettes has been controversial, with some arguing it could help reduce youth vaping and others saying it would hurt adults who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that youth vaping had declined in the past year, but that the use of e-cigarettes among adults had increased. The study also found that most youth who vape use flavoured products. The FDA is expected to release new regulations on e-cigarettes in the coming months. It is unclear whether the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes will be included in those regulations. The Trump administration has been under pressure from both sides of the vaping debate. Anti-vaping groups have urged the administration to implement the ban, while the vaping industry has lobbied against it. The decision to reverse the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes is a setback for anti-vaping groups. However, it is unclear whether the FDA will ultimately decide to include the ban in its new regulations. The vaping industry has welcomed the decision to reverse the ban. However, the industry is still facing challenges, including the ongoing investigation by the FDA and the threat of lawsuits from people who have suffered lung injuries from vaping.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Trial raises Parkinson's therapy hope,"The Japanese team hope their work could lead to stem cell trials in human patients before the end of 2018. Parkinson's disease causes the progressive loss of nerve cells that release dopamine, a chemical that helps control and coordinate body movements. Tremors, slowness of movement, muscle stiffness and impaired balance are common symptoms of the disease. Medications can help ease the symptoms, but current therapies cannot stop or reverse the progression of the condition. As the disease progresses, patients can struggle with everyday activities such as walking and talking, and experience difficulties with thinking and memory. The team, led by Dr Jun Takahashi at Kyoto University, took skin cells from a patient with Parkinson's disease and turned them into iPS cells. These stem cells can be grown and coaxed into developing into the type of brain cell that produces dopamine: a type called midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. The scientists then transplanted these cells into the brains of mice that had lost their own mDA neurons and showed signs of Parkinson's. The results, reported in the journal Nature, showed that the transplanted cells lived and produced dopamine for at least six months, improving the motor function of the mice. The team also showed that the transplanted cells could survive for at least two years in the brains of monkeys, another animal model of Parkinson's disease. The cells also seemed to integrate into the monkeys' brains and form connections with other neurons. ""Our findings suggest that transplantation of iPS cell-derived mDA neurons is a promising strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr Takahashi. ""We hope that our work will lead to the development of clinical trials in human patients in the near future."" Professor David Dexter, an expert in Parkinson's disease at the University of Cambridge, said the study was ""a major advance"" in the field of stem cell research for Parkinson's disease. He said the work ""provides further evidence of the potential for cell-based therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases"" and added that it was ""particularly encouraging"" that the transplanted cells had survived and integrated for as long as two years in the monkeys. However, he cautioned that there was still a long way to go before such treatments could be tested in humans. ""There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before we can move to clinical trials, such as the risk of the transplanted cells causing side-effects or forming tumours,"" he said. ""But this study is a very promising step forward.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Facebook testing 'downvote' button,"However, the social network denied that the new feature was a ""dislike"" button, which many Facebook users have requested. The downvote button is being tested as a way to help users find more relevant content and reduce the spread of misinformation. The downvote button will appear next to the like button on posts in certain groups and pages. Users can downvote posts that they find offensive, misleading, or irrelevant. The posts with the most downvotes will be less likely to appear in users' feeds. Facebook said that the downvote button is not intended to be used as a way to punish or silence people with different opinions. The company said that it is still testing the feature and that it may not be rolled out to all users. Some users have expressed concerns about the downvote button, saying that it could be used to bully or harass people. Others have said that it could be used to suppress dissenting opinions. Facebook said that it is taking these concerns seriously and that it will continue to monitor how the downvote button is used. The company said that it will make changes to the feature if necessary to ensure that it is not being used for harmful purposes. The downvote button is just one of several changes that Facebook is making to its platform in an effort to improve the user experience. The company has also recently announced plans to make it easier for users to control what they see in their feeds and to reduce the amount of misinformation that is shared on the platform. It remains to be seen whether the downvote button will be a positive or negative addition to Facebook.

Fishermen's fears over wind farm off County Down coast,"By Julian O'Neill BBC NI business correspondent A consortium, First Flight Wind, is behind the project that could see up to 100 turbines constructed off the coast of County Down. The company has already submitted an application to the Department of Infrastructure for the first phase of the wind farm, which could generate enough electricity to power 485,000 homes. However, fishermen in the area are concerned that the turbines will damage their livelihoods. They say the wind farm will affect the fishing grounds they use to catch prawns, crabs and lobsters. ""We're not against renewable energy, but we don't want it at the expense of our livelihoods,"" said John Potter, chairman of the Portavogie Fishermen's Association. ""This wind farm would be a disaster for us. It would destroy the fishing grounds that we have relied on for generations."" First Flight Wind has said it is committed to working with the fishing industry to minimise the impact of the wind farm. The company has also said it will provide compensation to fishermen who are affected by the project. However, Mr Potter said he is not convinced by these assurances. ""We've been let down by wind farm companies before,"" he said. ""They promise to work with us, but then they don't. We're not going to let that happen again."" The Department of Infrastructure is currently considering First Flight Wind's application for the first phase of the wind farm. The department will hold a public consultation on the project before making a decision. A spokesperson for the Department of Infrastructure said it is ""committed to ensuring that the development of renewable energy projects is done in a sustainable way that takes into account the needs of all stakeholders"". ""The department will carefully consider all representations made during the public consultation before making a decision on the planning application,"" the spokesperson said. The fishermen in Portavogie are not the only ones who are concerned about the wind farm. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA) has also raised concerns about the project. The RYA says the wind farm would ""significantly impact"" on the recreational sailing in the area. ""The proposed wind farm would be located in one of the most popular sailing areas in Northern Ireland,"" said the RYA. ""It would create a significant hazard to navigation and would make it difficult for sailors to enjoy the area."" First Flight Wind has said it will work with the RYA to minimise the impact of the wind farm on sailing. However, the RYA said it is not convinced by these assurances. ""We believe that the wind farm would have a negative impact on sailing in the area,"" said the RYA. ""We will continue to work with First Flight Wind to try to minimise the impact of the wind farm, but we believe that it should not be built in the proposed location.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Harry and Meghan say 'love wins' in first podcast from Spotify deal,"Singer Sir Elton John, presenter James Corden, author Matt Haig, tennis player Naomi Osaka and others feature on the first episode of Archewell Audio. It is the first fruit of Prince Harry and Meghan's multi-year deal with audio streaming giant Spotify, signed in December 2020. The couple said the episodes will ""uplift and entertain audiences around the world"" and feature ""thought-provoking conversations"" with ""historians, activists, athletes and artists"". ""Love Wins"" was recorded at their home in Montecito, where they moved in July with their son Archie. The couple talk about finding ""healing"" and power in the ""pain and trauma"" of the past year, after they stepped back from royal duties. The episode also features a meditation on ""compassion"" led by the Dalai Lama, which the couple say has ""helped us during this transition"". They met the Dalai Lama in 2016 during their royal tour of India and Bhutan. During the meeting, the Dalai Lama gave them a blessing for the birth of their first child. In the podcast, Meghan describes having ""a loss"" during the past year, which is believed to be a reference to a miscarriage that she suffered in July. She says: ""I can say that about eight or nine months ago, I felt the loss of a child. I know what that feels like, which is why I can empathize with what so many of you have been through during this."" She adds: ""In the pain of our loss, my husband's arm was on my back, rubbing my back, and he was saying 'It's going to be OK'. In those moments of darkness you grab onto any glimmer of hope you can. ""And we did, we found strength in each other, we found strength in the support of each other, in the community."" Harry adds: ""I've learned there's a hole in my heart that I think will never heal. I feel it every day, and I feel it for my wife because I can't imagine how it must feel to lose a child. ""But I've learned through this process that you need to grieve before you can heal. And our culture doesn't really allow us to grieve."" The couple say they want the podcast to be a ""safe space"" for people to share their experiences and connect with each other. They say: ""We hope that the conversations we have on this podcast will create a ripple effect of positivity, not just for our listeners, but for ourselves too.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Mental health: Pregnancy,"Smaller studies echo this finding. It is also clear many women experience stress, anxiety and other forms of emotional distress and mental illness at different points during pregnancy. A study based on data from over 3,000 women in England, Wales and Scotland reported a third (33%) of pregnant women screened had high levels of antenatal psychological distress. Around 7% of women are likely to experience antenatal depression, meaning depression during pregnancy. This is the most common maternal mental health problem experienced during pregnancy and in the year after birth. Symptoms of antenatal depression are similar to those of depression at other times, such as low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in weight or appetite, sleep disturbance, tiredness, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, and thoughts of harming oneself or the baby. Antenatal depression can be caused by a combination of factors, such as hormonal changes, life events and the psychological well-being of the expectant mother, especially experiences of stress, anxiety and a lack of social support. If left untreated, antenatal depression can significantly impact the mother's physical and mental health, as well as the health and development of the baby. It is important for women to be aware of the symptoms of antenatal depression and to seek help from their doctor, midwife or health visitor if they are concerned. There are effective treatments available, such as talking therapies and medication, which can help to manage symptoms and improve outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Other mental health conditions that can affect women during pregnancy include anxiety disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and psychosis. These conditions can have a significant impact on the mother's well-being and her ability to cope with pregnancy and motherhood. Treatment for these conditions may include talking therapies, medication and self-help strategies. It is important for women to know that they are not alone if they experience mental health problems during pregnancy or after birth. There is help and support available, and with the right treatment and support, it is possible to manage these conditions and have a positive pregnancy and birth experience.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Plan for Scottish opt-out organ donation system published,"At present, people must opt in to the system in order to donate their organs for transplants after they die. Under the proposals published at the Scottish Parliament, it will be assumed people were in favour of donation, unless they specifically register an objection. This opt-out system has been running successfully in Wales since 2015, and similar legislation is being considered in England and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government says the opt-out system is needed to increase the number of organs available for transplant and save lives. The proposals have been welcomed by some charities, but they have also been met with some opposition. Some people have argued that the opt-out system could lead to people's organs being taken without their consent. Others have argued that it could be seen as a form of coercion. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will include a number of safeguards to ensure that people's wishes are respected. For example, people will be able to easily register an objection to organ donation. They will also be able to change their minds at any time. The Scottish government has also said that the new system will be subject to regular review. The opt-out system is a controversial issue, but it is one that is likely to be debated for some time to come. In the meantime, it is important to remember that organ donation is a gift that can save lives. If you are able to donate, please consider doing so. What are the benefits of an opt-out organ donation system? There are a number of potential benefits to an opt-out organ donation system. These include: It could increase the number of organs available for transplant. This is because more people would be assumed to be in favour of donation, unless they specifically registered an objection. It could save lives. More organs available for transplant would mean that more people could receive life-saving transplants. It could reduce the waiting time for transplants. With more organs available, people would have to wait less time for a transplant. What are the concerns about an opt-out organ donation system? There are also a number of concerns about an opt-out organ donation system. These include: It could lead to people's organs being taken without their consent. This is a concern that is often raised by people who oppose opt-out systems. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will include a number of safeguards to ensure that people's wishes are respected. It could be seen as a form of coercion. Some people argue that an opt-out system could be seen as a form of coercion, as it would place the onus on people to opt out of donation rather than opt in. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will be voluntary and that people will be able to easily register an objection to organ donation. What is the next step? The Scottish government will now consider the feedback it receives on the proposals. It will then publish a final report on its plans. The opt-out system is likely to be debated for some time to come. However, it is important to remember that organ donation is a gift that can save lives.

Newspaper headlines: Trump 'eyes NHS' and Johnson's PM pitch,"By BBC NewsStaff ""Trump demands access to NHS funding as price of Brexit trade deal"" is the i's interpretation. The Times says Mr Trump is ""eyeing up the NHS"" and wants the NHS to be ""on the table"" in negotiations. The paper says he has raised the issue with Theresa May ""on several occasions"". The Guardian says Mr Trump ""has his sights on"" the NHS, while the Daily Mail reports that he ""wants to dismantle"" the health service. The paper says Mr Trump has suggested that the NHS is ""not working"" and that it should be replaced with a US-style system. The BBC has approached the White House for a response to the reports, but has yet to receive a reply. The NHS is a publicly funded health care system in the United Kingdom. It provides free or low-cost healthcare to all UK residents. The NHS is one of the largest healthcare systems in the world, with over 1.3 million employees. The NHS is a popular institution in the UK. A 2018 poll found that 83% of Britons are satisfied with the NHS. However, the NHS is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs and an aging population. The Conservative Party has pledged to increase funding for the NHS. However, it is unclear how the NHS will be affected by Brexit. The UK government has said that it will not compromise the NHS in any trade deal with the US. The US healthcare system is very different from the NHS. In the US, healthcare is provided by private insurance companies. This means that people who cannot afford insurance may not be able to get healthcare. The US healthcare system is also much more expensive than the NHS. The reports that Mr Trump wants to dismantle the NHS have caused alarm among many people in the UK. However, it is important to note that these reports are based on anonymous sources. It is possible that Mr Trump does not actually want to dismantle the NHS. It is also important to note that the NHS is a very popular institution in the UK. Any attempt to dismantle the NHS would likely be met with strong opposition from the British public.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Francois Fillon's wife facing payment investigation,"It comes after Le Canard Enchaine claimed Penelope Fillon earned about 500,000 euros (£430,000) as her husband's assistant in Parliament. The newspaper has questioned how much work was actually carried out. Mr Fillon, who is running to be France's next president, denies any wrongdoing. He has said that his wife played an ""essential"" role and that she earned about 600 euros (£520) a month. The investigation is being supervised by the French financial prosecutor and could result in charges being brought. If convicted, Mrs Fillon could face up to 10 years in prison. The scandal has been a major blow to Mr Fillon's campaign. He was once seen as the frontrunner in the race to become president, but his support has now dwindled. He is currently trailing his rival, Emmanuel Macron, in the polls. The Fillon affair has also raised questions about the accountability of politicians. Critics have accused Mr Fillon of abusing his position and of using public money to enrich his family. They have also called for tougher laws to prevent such scandals in the future. The scandal has also reignited the debate about the role of women in politics. Some have argued that Mrs Fillon's case shows that women are still not treated as equals in the political world. Others have said that her case should not be used to justify discrimination against women. The Fillon affair is a complex and controversial case that has raised important questions about accountability, transparency, and the role of women in politics.

Mexican Red Cross volunteers have also traveled to the flooded city of Houston. President Trump has not yet commented but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson thanked Mexico for the aid. ""We thank the government of Mexico for its generous offer of support and assistance to the people of Houston, Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey,"" Tillerson said in a statement. ""Mexico has been a steadfast partner in our efforts to respond to natural disasters and we are deeply grateful for their friendship and support."" The aid offer from Mexico comes as the death toll from Hurricane Harvey continues to rise. The storm has dumped historic amounts of rain on Houston and the surrounding area, causing widespread flooding. The storm has also knocked out power to over 1 million people and has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. The response to Hurricane Harvey has been a massive undertaking, involving federal, state, and local agencies, as well as numerous non-profit organizations. The Mexican Red Cross is one of the many organizations that have stepped up to help. ""The Mexican Red Cross has a long history of providing humanitarian aid in times of disaster,"" said Fernando Suinaga, president of the Mexican Red Cross. ""We are committed to helping the people of Houston recover from this devastating storm."" The Mexican Red Cross is one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world.

Chelsea fans cheer as team parades Champions League trophy,"The team, on two open-top buses, began the procession from its Stamford Bridge home up to Parsons Green. The Blues secured victory in a clash with Manchester City in Porto on 29 May, and will be hoping to continue their success in August's Super Cup, where they will face Europa League winners Villarreal. Chelsea completed a sensational Champions League triumph on Saturday night as Kai Havertz's first-half goal earned a 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the final. Victory in Porto ensured Thomas Tuchel's side ended a 19-year wait to be crowned champions of Europe for the second time. The German has masterminded Chelsea's success since arriving in January following the sacking of club legend Frank Lampard. Tuchel hailed his team's ""huge effort"" and ""great performance"" and said he was ""very proud"" of his players. ""It's a special moment because we shared it with the fans back home,"" he told reporters. ""I feel part of the Chelsea family. We won it together. It was a tough year but we did it. We never lost hope."" Captain Cesar Azpilicueta said: ""This is a special moment. This is what we work for every single day. We knew it would be really tough against one of the best teams in the world and we kept fighting until the end.""

Abuse inquiry: Legal action threat from 'left out' survivors,"By Reevel Alderson BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Survivors group White Flowers Alba said it was seeking a judicial review because the inquiry will not look at their cases. It claimed this was ""unfair"" as similar investigations elsewhere in the UK have included cases dating back decades. The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) is examining historical child abuse in care homes, schools, and other institutions from 1932 onwards. However, it will not be investigating cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. This has angered some survivors and campaigners, who believe the SCAI should examine all cases of abuse, regardless of when they happened or whether they have been investigated before. White Flowers Alba is representing around 20 people who were abused in care in the 1950s and 1960s. It claims that the SCAI's decision not to investigate their cases is ""unfair"" and ""discriminatory."" The group has been given permission to seek a judicial review of the SCAI's decision. A judicial review is a court hearing where a judge examines the decision-making process of a public body to see if it was lawful and reasonable. If the judge finds that the SCAI's decision was unlawful or unreasonable, it could quash the decision and order the SCAI to reconsider. The Scottish government said it was ""aware"" of the legal challenge and would ""defend"" the SCAI's decision. A spokesperson said: ""The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry is independent of the Scottish government. ""The inquiry has decided that it will not investigate cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. ""This decision was taken in order to ensure that the inquiry does not duplicate the work of other investigations and to avoid prejudicing any ongoing legal proceedings."" The SCAI has said it is ""committed to investigating all allegations of child abuse in Scotland."" However, it has said that it cannot investigate cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. The inquiry has said it will consider investigating cases that have not been examined by other inquiries or are not the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings.

Police Ombudsman to resume RUC misconduct investigations,"Investigations were suspended in 2011 after a critical report into the running of the office. The report found that the independence of the office had been compromised. The Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland is an independent body that investigates complaints against the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The ombudsman's office was established in 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement. In 2011, a critical report into the running of the Police Ombudsman's office found that the independence of the office had been compromised. The report made a number of recommendations, including that the ombudsman should be appointed by an independent panel, and that the office should be given more resources. The Police Ombudsman has now announced that it will resume investigations into RUC misconduct. The ombudsman's office has said that it has put in place a number of measures to address the concerns raised in the 2011 report, and that it is now confident that it can conduct independent and impartial investigations. The decision to resume investigations into RUC misconduct has been welcomed by a number of victims' groups. However, some police officers have expressed concerns about the ombudsman's independence, and have said that they fear they could be unfairly targeted by investigations. The Police Ombudsman's office is an important part of the justice system in Northern Ireland. It is essential that the ombudsman is independent and impartial, and that it has the resources to carry out its work effectively. The decision to resume investigations into RUC misconduct is a positive step, but it is important to remember that the ombudsman's office still faces a number of challenges. One of the challenges facing the ombudsman's office is the lack of funding. The ombudsman's office has been underfunded for a number of years, and this has made it difficult to recruit and retain staff. The ombudsman's office has also been criticized for being too slow to investigate complaints. In some cases, it has taken years for the ombudsman to complete an investigation. Another challenge facing the ombudsman's office is the lack of public confidence. Some people have lost confidence in the ombudsman's office, and they believe that it is not independent or impartial. The ombudsman's office needs to do more to build public confidence, and it needs to demonstrate that it is committed to investigating complaints fairly and impartially. The Police Ombudsman's office is an important part of the justice system in Northern Ireland.

Infant classes over 30 almost treble in five years,"By Judith Burns BBC News education reporter Some 72,000 infant pupils in England are now in large classes, up from 24,700 in 2008, suggests data from the Department for Education (DfE). The previous government had pledged to reduce the number of pupils in infant classes with more than 30 students, but the number has almost tripled in five years. The DfE data shows: > GCSE results: Benchmark for 4 and 5 grades falls by 0.3% > University applications: Scottish applicants to English universities rise > Is your school living on borrowed time? The National Union of Teachers (NUT) said the figures ""beggared belief"". But a DfE spokesman said many schools used larger classes in infant classes because it worked best for them. The DfE data shows that the number of year 1 and year 2 pupils in classes of more than 30 has almost trebled in the past five years. In 2008, just 3.8% were being taught in classes of this size, but by 2013, this had risen to 10.7%. The government had aimed to reduce this figure to 10% by 2015. Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the NUT, said: ""We know large classes impact on the ability of teachers to give individual attention and support to their pupils, and it impacts on children's progress and achievement."" He said the ""astounding"" rise in large infant classes was down to the fact that the government had cut funding for schools. ""What we want to see is a reduction in class sizes for all pupils, so that teachers can give individual attention to the children in their class,"" he added. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) also expressed concern about the rise in large infant classes. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, said: ""The government must reverse its policy of cutting funding to schools, which has forced heads to reduce class sizes."" She added: ""We know that smaller class sizes help pupils to learn more effectively and achieve better grades."" However, a DfE spokesman said the government had protected funding for schools. He said: ""Many schools choose to use larger classes in infant classes, because they are best placed to make judgments about what works best for the children they teach.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Alun Cairns: Trial row ex-minister paid £16,000 after resignation","A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan MP said the payment was ""in common with the departure of every minister"". Mr Cairns resigned in November over allegations of ""disloyalty"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The news comes after it was revealed that former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson received a £24,000 severance payment when he resigned in December over allegations of paid lobbying. The payments have raised questions about the government's commitment to transparency and accountability. Labour MP Jon Ashworth said the payments were ""a disgrace"" and called on the government to ""stop the gravy train"". ""These payments are a slap in the face to taxpayers,"" he said. ""They show that the government is more interested in looking after its own than in serving the public."" The Conservative Party has defended the payments, saying that they are ""in line with long-standing practice"". A spokesman for the party said: ""These payments are made to cover the costs of winding up ministerial duties and are not a bonus or a reward."" However, the payments have been criticized by some Conservative MPs. Former minister David Davis said that the payments were ""not a good look"" and called on the government to ""rethink"" its policy. ""I think it's a mistake to make these payments,"" he said. ""It sends the wrong message to the public."" The controversy over the payments is likely to continue in the coming weeks. The government is facing pressure to review its policy on severance payments for ministers.

Peckham baby death attack: Accused 'not ready to be father',"Malorie Bantala, 22, from Peckham, suffered life-threatening injuries and gave birth at 32 weeks to a stillborn boy following the attack. Kevin Wilson, and a 17-year-old boy, allegedly wore helmets and attacked her when she refused to give them money. Wilson has pleaded not guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing a child to be born prematurely. The 17-year-old boy has also denied the charges. The court heard that Bantala was walking home from a friend's house when the pair approached her and asked her for money. When she refused, Wilson allegedly beckoned for the younger teenager to ""go get the helmet"". The younger boy went to a nearby shop and returned with a helmet bearing the logo of a motorbike delivery company. CCTV cameras show Wilson putting on the helmet as he approached Bantala. He then allegedly used it to strike her on the head. ""She was knocked unconscious and left with a fractured skull,"" said prosecutor Richard Sutton. The 17-year-old boy then allegedly used the helmet to smash a car window, while Wilson kicked and punched Bantala as she lay unconscious. Bantala was rushed to hospital where she gave birth to a stillborn baby boy named Joshua. She had been 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the attack. A medical report revealed that Bantala had suffered multiple skull fractures, a bleed on the brain, and a broken nose. Her unborn baby had died as a result of a placental abruption, caused by the blunt force trauma to Bantala's abdomen. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Bantala said: ""I have been left with life-changing injuries. I have metal plates in my skull and I have to wear a helmet to protect my brain every time I go out. ""I have nightmares about what happened and I have flashbacks.

The CQC found that the majority of hospitals were providing good or outstanding care, but there were still some areas where improvements were needed. The CQC's chief executive, David Behan, said: ""The NHS is facing significant challenges, but we are seeing improvements in the quality of care at many hospitals. This is thanks to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, who are committed to providing the best possible care for their patients.""

Zimbabwe media slow to cover military takeover,"By BBC Monitoring The world through its media State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that the military had taken over but offered little by way of analysis or context. Independent newspapers and websites carried the story prominently as the main event. Some had little detail while others carried full transcripts of the statement made by the major-general. The privately-owned NewsDay, the first newspaper to be printed after the takeover, carried a front-page editorial comment on the military's intervention under the heading: ""Zimbabwe now on edge"". The paper's editor, Wisdom Mdzungairi, said: ""We are witnessing the demise of a dictatorship that has been aided and abetted by an incompetent government which has presided over years of grand-scale corruption, maladministration and economic meltdown."" He added that many people had not been surprised by the military's intervention, but he called on the military leaders to move quickly ""to restore stability and legitimacy"". Another privately-owned newspaper, the Daily News, also published a transcript of the major-general's statement under the headline: ""Army steps in to end Mugabe's rule."" However, the paper's website carried much more - including speculation over possible motives for the military intervention. It quoted former cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo as saying that the military was likely to be unhappy with the first lady Grace Mugabe's ""monopoly"" over her husband. It also carried reports of violence in Harare's central business district on Wednesday where the army had clashed with supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party. The online version of the Standard newspaper said the army had denied these reports and that there had been no violence. However, another privately-owned newspaper, the Zimbabwe Independent, said that ""soldiers ran amok"" in the capital, attacking people in company attire and searching cars. The paper also quoted businessman and political analyst, Trevor Ncube, as saying it was time for Zimbabwe to move on and embrace a ""new dispensation"". The online edition of the privately-owned Financial Gazette carried the transcript of the major-general's statement. It also carried articles on the international reaction to the military intervention and the implications for the country's economy. There was also an article headlined: ""Mugabe resigns: End of an era"", which described the president's rise and fall and the political turmoil that had engulfed the country in recent months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine,"By James Gallagher Health and science correspondent The UK's medicines safety regulator says there have been 242 clotting cases and 49 deaths, with 28.5 million doses of the vaccine administered. But the risk is slightly higher in younger people. Most of the cases have occurred in younger people - three-quarters of the cases have been in people under 50. The problem has been linked to the vaccine triggering an unusual immune response which causes clotting. There are two other effective vaccines being used in the UK - Moderna and Pfizer. Experts say these use slightly different technology that has not been linked to this rare clotting problem. This is why the recommendation is only for under-40s. The JCVI says the small number of blood clots means the overall benefits of vaccination in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks. It says the advice will be kept under review as more data becomes available. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said: ""This is a risk-benefit decision and we have decided that the balance of risk and benefit favours the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in adults under 40."" Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, said: ""The JCVI has advised that adults aged 30 and over who have not yet received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine. ""We have also advised that adults aged 18-29 years who have not yet received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine."" The JCVI says that those who have already had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still receive a second dose of the same vaccine. This is because the risk of a blood clot after the first dose is much lower than the risk of Covid-19. It also says that there is no need to test people for clotting disorders before they get a Covid vaccine. The JCVI's advice is based on the latest data on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It says that the data shows that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sea search for Brighton woman is called off,"Coastguards said it was thought a couple entered the sea after a night out and the woman was swept away. Rescue teams were scrambled overnight and an extensive air and sea operation was launched, involving lifeboats from Brighton, Shoreham, Littlehampton, Newhaven and Eastbourne. However, by Saturday evening, the search for the woman had been called off, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. A spokesperson said: ""The decision has been made to stand down the search operation as no further evidence has been found to locate the person who entered the water in the early hours of this morning."" A Sussex Police spokesperson said: ""Police are making enquiries regarding the circumstances and are in contact with the family.""

""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends,"" they said. ""It is heart-breaking when there is a loss of life."" The incident comes just weeks after a man died after jumping into the sea from Brighton Palace Pier with his dog. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has issued a warning to the public about the dangers of entering the sea at night. An MCA spokesperson said: ""Entering the water at night, even on a calm sea, can have tragic consequences. The water can be much colder than expected, which can reduce your ability to swim. The sea can also be unpredictable, and currents can quickly carry you away from safety."" The MCA advises people to always swim at a lifeguarded beach, and to never enter the water alone.

Fiscal Phil's Budget - is it just about the cash?,"David Cornock Parliamentary correspondent, Wales The Budget throws up more than enough to last a lifetime. And when there's not much money around, politicians tend to begin the vital process of kicking the can down the road. In Rishi Sunak's first outing as Chancellor of the Exchequer, there was some trust-me jam tomorrow. Fiscal Phil, as some have started calling him, is a can-kicker extraordinaire. Here is a brief list of things the UK government will be doing: 1. Borrowing £355bn to fund the package of measures 2. Raising corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023 3. Freezing income tax personal allowances and higher rate threshold 4. Cutting Universal Credit by £20 a week 5. Setting up a new UK Infrastructure Bank 6. Spending £12bn on the Restart programme to create jobs 7. Providing £15bn for the NHS 8. Investing £5bn in new bus and cycle lanes 9. Confirming that HS2 will be completed 10. Increasing the minimum wage to £9.50 an hour for over-23s There has been much criticism of the detail in the package but the broad effect is clear. Rishi Sunak is attempting to limit the impact of the economic shock that followed the pandemic. He is doing that by holding off on tax rises and borrowing more to keep spending levels very high. He is using the Infrastructure Bank and the Restart scheme to create jobs. And he is protecting the NHS and other public services from the full force of the spending cuts. This is all very expensive. The Chancellor has increased borrowing to record levels. It means that the government will now have to borrow more than £2,000 every second over the next five years just to pay the interest on the UK's vast debts. However, the Chancellor argues that the alternative would be even more painful. Without this support, the UK economy would shrink by 6% over the next two years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Unemployment would reach almost 12%, the worst recession seen in the UK for three centuries. And public services would have to be slashed to the bone. The Chancellor is gambling that the economic recovery will be strong enough to allow him to pay down the debt in the future. But if the recovery is slower than expected, the UK will be left with a very expensive hangover. The Budget has been welcomed by some economists, who argue that it was necessary to prevent a deep recession. Others have criticized the package as being too expensive and unfair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the Budget was ""regressive"", meaning it would hit the poorest in society hardest. The Resolution Foundation think tank said the Budget did not do enough to help low-income families. The government has argued that the Budget is fair because it includes a number of measures to help low-income families, such as increasing the minimum wage and spending more on childcare. However, the IFS said that these measures were not enough to offset the regressive impact of other measures, such as freezing income tax personal allowances and cutting Universal Credit. The Budget is a complex and controversial package of measures. It is too early to say whether it will be successful in preventing a deep recession. But it is clear that the UK government is taking a big gamble with the country's finances.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

L'Origine du Monde: Mystery Courbet nude uncovered 150 years on,"Now a French scholar may have solved the mystery of whose body was painted so explicitly in his 1866 work, not exhibited publicly in France till 1991. The subject of Courbet's work was for years assumed to be his mistress, Constance Queniaux. But art historian Louis-Édouard Fourcaut has recently put forward a new theory - it was actually Courbet's sister Zoé. Fourcaut has been working on this theory since 2014, when he began to compare the painting to other works by Courbet, including a portrait of Zoé that he painted in 1860. He noticed similarities in the way the two women's bodies were depicted, and in particular the way their pubic hair was rendered. Further research revealed that Zoé was living with Courbet at the time he painted L'Origine du Monde, and that she had posed for him on several other occasions. Fourcaut also found evidence that Zoé was a lesbian, which may have made her more willing to pose for such an explicit painting. If Fourcaut's theory is correct, it would mean that L'Origine du Monde is not merely a depiction of female sexuality, but also a celebration of lesbian love. This would be a significant finding, as it would be one of the few surviving examples of lesbian art from the 19th century. Fourcaut's theory has been met with some skepticism by other art historians, who argue that there is not enough evidence to prove that Zoé was the model for L'Origine du Monde. However, the theory has also generated a great deal of interest, and it is likely to be debated for many years to come. Regardless of who the model was, L'Origine du Monde remains a powerful and controversial work of art. It is a celebration of female sexuality and a challenge to traditional notions of beauty and morality. It is a reminder that art can be both beautiful and transgressive, and that it can still shock and surprise us today.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The paper outlines how MI5 has worked with the National Crime Agency and tech companies to develop AI-powered tools that can automatically detect and remove CSAM from the internet. These tools have been used to take down hundreds of thousands of images and videos of child abuse, and have helped to identify and prosecute offenders. MI5's director general, Ken McCallum, said that the use of AI was ""a game-changer"" in the fight against child sexual abuse. ""This is a truly horrific crime that destroys lives,"" he said. ""We must use every tool at our disposal to stop it."" The agency's paper also addresses the ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in this field. It says that MI5 is committed to using AI in a way that is ""proportionate, necessary, and fair."" The paper also sets out a number of safeguards to ensure that AI is not used to target innocent people. These include: Ensuring that AI tools are only used to identify CSAM, and not other types of content. Subjecting AI tools to rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure that they are accurate and reliable. Providing human oversight of all AI-powered decisions. The agency's paper is a significant step forward in the fight against child sexual abuse. It shows how AI can be used to make a real difference in protecting children from this horrific crime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cost of dying 'rose more than 10% last year',"The average cost of services including probate, headstones, flowers and the burial or cremation fee is now £8,427, according to insurer SunLife. The average cost of a funeral has increased by 87% since the survey was first conducted. The research, which surveyed 2,000 people, found that the cost of dying has risen by more than 10% in the past year alone. The biggest increases were seen in the cost of probate, which rose by 15%, and the cost of headstones, which rose by 12%. The cost of dying is a significant financial burden for many families, and it is only going to get worse in the future. As the population ages, the number of deaths is expected to increase, and this will put further pressure on funeral costs. There are a number of things that people can do to reduce the cost of dying. One option is to take out a funeral plan, which can help to cover the costs of a funeral in advance. Another option is to choose a more affordable funeral option, such as a direct cremation. Whatever option you choose, it is important to plan ahead for the cost of dying. By doing so, you can help to ensure that your family is not left with a large financial burden when you pass away. Here are some tips for reducing the cost of dying: Take out a funeral plan. Funeral plans can help to cover the costs of a funeral in advance, and they can often be purchased for a monthly fee. Choose a more affordable funeral option. There are a number of different funeral options available, and some are more affordable than others. For example, a direct cremation is a more affordable option than a traditional funeral. Ask for help from friends and family. If you are struggling to pay for a funeral, you can ask for help from friends and family. They may be able to help you with the costs of the funeral, or they may be able to provide emotional support. Consider a crowdfunding campaign. If you are unable to pay for a funeral, you can consider starting a crowdfunding campaign. This can be a way to raise money from friends, family, and other people who want to help.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting?","Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting? Bullfighting is a ""supremely dangerous art"", says Garry Marvin, professor of human-animal studies at Queen's University, Ontario. ""It's not just the risk of being gored or trampled, but also the psychological and emotional toll it takes on the participants."" Who is at risk? The most obvious people at risk are the matadors, who face the bulls in the ring. But other participants are also at risk, including the banderilleros, who place barbed sticks in the bull's neck, and the picadors, who lance the bull on horseback. Even spectators can be injured, as bulls have been known to jump the barriers and into the stands. What are the injuries? Bullfighting injuries can be severe and even fatal. Matadors can suffer from goring, trampling, and other blunt force trauma. Banderilleros and picadors can also suffer from serious injuries, including broken bones and puncture wounds. Spectators have been known to be gored, trampled, and even killed by bulls. Why is bullfighting dangerous? Bullfighting is dangerous because it involves interacting with a large, powerful, and unpredictable animal. Bulls are capable of inflicting serious injuries with their horns, hooves, and body weight. They are also very agile and can move quickly and unpredictably. This makes it difficult for matadors and other participants to avoid being injured. How can the risks be reduced? There are a number of ways to reduce the risks associated with bullfighting. One is to use more protective gear, such as helmets, chest plates, and leg guards. Another is to train matadors and other participants more thoroughly. Finally, the rules of the sport can be changed to make it less dangerous. For example, the use of swords could be banned, and the bulls could be given more space to escape. Is bullfighting worth the risk? The question of whether or not bullfighting is worth the risk is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they believe that the sport is worth the risks involved.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

HMV saved: Music fans and employees give their verdict,"By Steve Holden Newsbeat reporter in Manchester The company has been in administration since the beginning of 2013 after problems in the face of online competition. Hilco has acquired 132 HMV shops, including its flagship store on Oxford Street. The deal secures more than 2,500 jobs, but 27 stores will close. In Manchester, news that the Arndale store has been saved was welcomed by shoppers. Sean, a musician, told Newsbeat: ""It gives a sense of community, a sense of belonging, knowing there's a place you can go and see new artists and old artists. ""They do so much to help up-and-coming artists and they give people the chance to hear new music. It's a real asset to the city."" Employee Leanne said: ""I'm really happy to be staying. I knew there was a chance I would lose my job and it would have been hard to find another job. ""The customers are why I do the job. I've had very few rude people in the eight years I've been here. It's a lively working environment and that makes it a really good place to work."" In London, Newsbeat spoke to Sainsbury's employee John, who was browsing the HMV store on Oxford Street. He said: ""I like coming here. It's an iconic store. I like the choice of music, it's very extensive. ""It's not just music they sell here. They also stock films and other entertainment products. It's a convenient shopping experience."" HMV began life as a record shop in 1921. It later expanded into other areas such as DVDs, games consoles and technology. In recent years, the company has faced increasing competition from online retailers such as Amazon. It has also been hit by the decline in CD sales. The rescue deal with Hilco includes £30m of new investment. Hilco said it plans to offer a ""unique and immersive experience"" for customers. It is also planning to create a new online platform for HMV.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

A-level exam 'leak': Belfast grammar pupils sanctioned,"The schools have declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but a spokesperson for the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said: ""We can confirm that a small number of students from two schools have been subject to a penalty for malpractice in the June 2022 A-level examinations."" ""The CCEA takes all allegations of malpractice very seriously and investigates all cases thoroughly,"" the spokesperson added. ""Where malpractice is proven, the CCEA has a range of penalties available, including the cancellation of results or the disqualification of students from future examinations."" The news comes after a number of high-profile cases of exam cheating in recent years. In 2019, it was reported that over 100 students in England had their A-level results cancelled after they were found to have used unauthorized materials in their exams. In response to the growing problem of exam cheating, the CCEA has introduced a number of new measures to deter students from engaging in malpractice. These measures include: Increased use of invigilators and surveillance cameras Random searches of students and their belongings The use of software to detect plagiarism The CCEA is also working with schools to raise awareness of the consequences of exam cheating and to encourage students to report any suspicious activity. Despite these measures, it is clear that exam cheating remains a problem. The CCEA's recent announcement is a reminder that students who engage in malpractice will be punished. It is important to note that the nine students affected by the CCEA's investigation represent a very small minority of the thousands of students who took A-level exams in June 2022. The vast majority of students are honest and hardworking, and they deserve to have their achievements recognized. Exam cheating is a serious issue, but it is important to keep it in perspective.

Will Brexit last longer than other winning words of the year?,"The word had its first recorded use in 2013 but as the EU referendum approached, more and more people started using it. It's an increase that Collins says is ""unheard of"". But Brexit is not the first word to have been popularised by a major political event. In 2016, Oxford Dictionaries named ""post-truth"" as its word of the year, reflecting the growing trend towards people shaping their political beliefs around emotion rather than facts. And in 2017, Merriam-Webster's word of the year was ""feminism"", reflecting the growing prominence of the feminist movement in popular culture. So, could Brexit be another short-lived phenomenon? It's certainly possible. Political language often changes rapidly, as new events and ideas emerge. For example, the word ""austerity"" was relatively obscure before the 2008 financial crisis, but it quickly became a household term as governments around the world implemented cuts to public spending. However, it's also possible that Brexit could stick around for longer. The UK's withdrawal from the EU is a complex and unprecedented process, and it could have a major impact on British society for many years to come. As a result, it's likely that people will continue to use the word Brexit to describe the process and its consequences. Of course, it's impossible to say for sure how long Brexit will remain in the public consciousness. However, it's clear that the word has already had a major impact on the English language. It has become a shorthand way of describing the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and it has also entered the wider political lexicon as a term for a major political upheaval. Whether Brexit will continue to be used for decades to come remains to be seen. But for now, it seems clear that the word is here to stay for the foreseeable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Garden eels 'forgetting about humans' need people to video-chat,"Keepers at Tokyo's Sumida Aquarium, which has been closed since 1 March due to the coronavirus pandemic, are starting to worry about their garden eels. The sensitive little creatures had become used to seeing hundreds of faces peering into their tank every day, and now they're starting to forget about humans. ""They're not used to seeing people anymore, so they're starting to lose their trust in us,"" said aquarium keeper Rina Ono. ""They used to come up to the surface and say hello, but now they're hiding in their burrows."" The garden eels are not the only animals at the aquarium that are being affected by the lack of visitors. The penguins are also starting to get restless, and the sea otters are spending more time sleeping. ""All of our animals are social creatures, so they're used to interacting with people,"" said Ono. ""It's hard for them to understand why we're not around anymore."" The aquarium staff is trying to keep the animals entertained and engaged, but it's not the same as having visitors around. ""We're doing everything we can to make sure they're happy and healthy,"" said Ono. ""But we can't replace the interaction they get from people."" The aquarium is hoping to reopen soon, but it's not clear when that will be. In the meantime, the staff is asking people to video-chat with the animals. ""It's not the same as being here in person, but it's a way for people to connect with the animals and show them that they're still loved,"" said Ono. To video-chat with the animals, visit the Sumida Aquarium website. You can choose to chat with the penguins, the sea otters, or the garden eels. ""We hope that people will take advantage of this opportunity to connect with the animals,"" said Ono.

Coronavirus: Bat scientists find new evidence,"They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand. And blood tests from nearby villagers revealed that some had antibodies which may have been the result of a previous infection with a bat coronavirus. This suggests that the virus could have spread from bats to humans, although more research is needed to show whether this definitely happened. The Thai researchers say their findings ""support the hypothesis that bats could be the natural reservoir for the Covid-19 virus"". But experts say we may never know for sure whether bats were the original source of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. There are lots of different viruses in bats but only a handful have been known to infect humans, and most cause mild symptoms. But the Sars and Mers coronaviruses, which have both led to deadly outbreaks in the past two decades, originated in bats. Bats are thought to be the most likely hosts of the new coronavirus because they are mammals like us and they are known to carry coronaviruses. The Thai researchers collected samples of saliva and faeces from 649 bats in Thailand between June 2020 and May 2021. They tested more than 300 samples and identified nine different coronaviruses. One of them was a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans. The researchers say it is the closest match between a coronavirus in bats and the Covid virus yet identified. They also collected blood samples from 829 people living near the wildlife sanctuary. More than 10% tested positive for antibodies to a coronavirus. This means they had already been exposed to a coronavirus. The researchers speculate that exposure to bats may be the cause. However, they admit that the blood tests could be picking up antibodies to other coronaviruses and not the virus that causes Covid-19. More research is needed to determine whether these people were infected with the novel coronavirus. The researchers say their work highlights the risk of bat coronaviruses getting into humans. They are calling for greater surveillance and more research to understand bat viruses. They also say it is important to protect bat habitats.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Saudi Arabia hosts its first ever women's cycle race,"By Paul Harrison BBC UGC and Social News Saudi women cyclists were able to compete in a race held in the city of Jeddah on Tuesday. Forty-seven women took part in the event, which covered a distance of 10km. The race was organized by the Saudi Cycling Federation and was the first of its kind to be held in the country. One of the participants, Samah al-Hamdan, said that she was delighted to be able to take part in the race. ""I'm so happy that I was able to participate in this race,"" she said. ""It's a great opportunity for women in Saudi Arabia to show that we can do anything that men can do."" Another participant, Aseel al-Zahrani, said that she hoped the race would inspire other women to take up cycling. ""I hope that this race will encourage more women to get involved in cycling,"" she said. ""It's a great way to stay healthy and active."" The race was held in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, which is known for its relaxed atmosphere. The event was widely praised by human rights groups, who said that it was a sign of progress for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. ""This is a significant step forward for women's rights in Saudi Arabia,"" said Rothna Begum, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""It shows that the government is listening to the demands of women for greater equality."" The race was also praised by social media users, who said that it was a positive sign for the future of Saudi Arabia. ""This is a great day for Saudi Arabia,"" said one user. ""It shows that the country is moving in the right direction."" The race was held under the patronage of Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, who is the president of the Saudi Cycling Federation. Princess Reema is a vocal advocate for women's rights and has been instrumental in promoting cycling among women in Saudi Arabia. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has made a number of reforms to improve women's rights. In 2018, women were granted the right to drive, and in 2019, they were allowed to travel without the permission of a male guardian. These reforms have been welcomed by women's rights groups, who say that they are a sign of progress for women in Saudi Arabia. However, there are still a number of restrictions on women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Women are not allowed to vote in elections, and they are not allowed to marry without the permission of a male guardian. These restrictions are expected to be lifted in the future, as Saudi Arabia continues to move towards greater equality for women.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cholera death toll rises in hurricane-hit Haiti,"Fifty-nine people had died up until and including Thursday, and 617 others had been infected, bringing the total affected to 7,359, the ministry added. The news came as aid agencies stepped up their response to a spiralling cholera outbreak triggered by the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, described by the UN as the worst humanitarian crisis to hit Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam, which has been working to bring clean water and sanitation to Haiti since the hurricane, said the situation was becoming increasingly desperate. ""The number of cholera cases is rising rapidly, and the death toll is also climbing,"" said Oxfam's Haiti director Yolette Etienne. ""We are doing everything we can to get clean water and sanitation to those who need it, but it is a huge challenge."" The hurricane destroyed homes and infrastructure, and left many areas without access to clean water or sanitation. This created the ideal conditions for cholera, a waterborne disease that can spread rapidly in unsanitary conditions. Cholera symptoms can include diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration, and can be fatal if not treated quickly. The Haitian government has declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak, and is working with aid agencies to provide clean water and sanitation to those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also providing support, and has sent a team of experts to Haiti to help with the response. The WHO said the situation was ""extremely serious"", and warned that the number of cholera cases could continue to rise in the coming weeks. ""We are doing everything we can to support the Haitian government in its efforts to contain the outbreak,"" said WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier. ""But we need more support from the international community. This is a global health emergency, and we need to act now.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Rail disruption caused by bad planning, Network Rail says","Thousands of passengers had their journeys disrupted when work near King's Cross took longer than planned.

The work, which involved replacing a bridge, began on Saturday and was due to finish on Tuesday. However, problems were encountered, and the work is now expected to finish on Friday. The disruption affected trains on the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh, as well as services on the Great Northern and Thameslink routes. Passengers were advised to check before they travel and to allow extra time for their journeys. Network Rail said in a statement: ""We are sorry for the disruption that this has caused.

The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""We understand the frustration that this disruption is causing passengers. We are working closely with Network Rail to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."" The work at King's Cross is part of a £1 billion investment to upgrade the station.

Catalonia Spain: Separatists set to boost majority in regional parliament,"That would give them a majority of eight seats, making them less reliant on smaller anti-establishment parties for support. The left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC) looks set to remain the largest party with 33 seats, up from 32. The centre-right Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) has seen its support fall to 32 seats from 34, while the far-left Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (CUP) has increased its presence from four to nine seats. The pro-union centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) party has lost 11 seats, falling from 36 to 25, while the Socialists (PSC) have gained five, rising from 17 to 22. Both the conservative Popular Party (PP) and far-right Vox have suffered heavy losses, with the former falling from four to three seats and the latter losing all its 11 seats. The pro-independence parties have welcomed the results, saying they show that the majority of Catalans want a referendum on independence. However, the Spanish government has reiterated that it will not allow a referendum, arguing that it would be unconstitutional. The results are likely to increase tensions between the Catalan government and Madrid, and could reignite the independence movement. Catalonia, a wealthy and populous region in north-eastern Spain, has a long history of seeking independence. In 2017, it held a referendum on independence, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government. The result, which saw a majority in favour of independence, was not recognised by Madrid. The Catalan parliament subsequently declared independence, but this was also rejected by the Spanish government and the region was placed under direct rule from Madrid. In 2018, the Catalan government was reinstated, but tensions between the two sides remain high. The pro-independence movement has continued to push for a referendum, while the Spanish government has refused to grant one. The results of the regional elections are likely to further polarise the debate on independence, and could lead to renewed conflict between the Catalan government and Madrid.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping,"In a legal notice, Clean Air in London asked the mayor to ""delay implementing his decision until he can ensure air pollution is not worsened"". Mr Johnson has promised to get rid of the west London ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) from October 25. The campaign group said it was ""deeply concerned"" that the mayor's decision could lead to more air pollution. The Ulez, which charges drivers of older, more polluting vehicles, has been in operation since 2019 and has been credited with reducing air pollution in central London. A study by King's College London found that the Ulez had led to a 20% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels in central London. The mayor has said that he is scrapping the Ulez because it is ""unfair"" to drivers and is not necessary to improve air quality. However, Clean Air in London said that the mayor's decision was ""based on flawed evidence"" and that it would lead to worse air pollution. The group said that it was ""prepared to take legal action"" if the mayor did not delay implementing his decision. The mayor's office said that it was ""confident"" that the Ulez could be scrapped without worsening air quality. A spokesperson for the mayor said: ""The mayor is committed to improving air quality in London and believes that the Ulez is not the best way to do this."" The spokesperson said that the mayor was ""looking at other ways to improve air quality"" and that he would ""be announcing further details in due course"". The legal challenge to the mayor's decision is likely to be the first of many. Several other groups, including the London Assembly and the Green Party, have also said that they are considering legal action. The legal challenge is likely to focus on the mayor's duty to protect public health. The mayor has a statutory duty to reduce air pollution in London and the legal challenge will argue that scrapping the Ulez will breach this duty. The legal challenge is also likely to focus on the mayor's decision-making process. The legal challenge will argue that the mayor's decision to scrap the Ulez was not based on a proper assessment of the evidence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Supreme Court divorce approval sought by 'unhappy wife',"Tini Owens, 68, from Broadway, Worcestershire, wants a court's refusal to grant her a divorce overruled. She says her marriage to Hugh Owens, 80, has irretrievably broken down after 40 years. But a judge previously ruled the pair must remain married because their vows included a promise to stay together ""until death us do part"". Mrs Owens, who is being supported by the charity Rights of Women, is now asking the Supreme Court to consider her case. The couple met in 1969. They married two years later and have two sons and several grandchildren. But they have lived largely separate lives for years. Mrs Owens says she faced ""verbal and emotional abuse"" from her husband during their marriage. She says she has found love again and wants to be with her new partner. In a statement, she said: ""I am seeking a divorce because I do not believe that I should have to stay trapped in a loveless marriage. It is not right that the courts can force someone to stay married when they do not want to be."" The case has sparked debate about the role of the state in marriage. Some argue that the institution of marriage should be protected and that divorce should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Others say that people should be free to leave unhappy marriages and that the state should not interfere. The Supreme Court is expected to consider Mrs Owens's case later this year. If she is successful, it would be a landmark ruling that could have implications for other couples seeking a divorce. Rights of Women's legal director, Harriet Wistrich, said: ""We are supporting Mrs Owens's application to the Supreme Court because we believe that the law on divorce needs to be reformed. ""It is not right that people can be forced to stay in unhappy marriages. Marriage should be a voluntary union and people should be free to leave it when it is no longer working."" The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said it would be following the case with interest. A spokesman said: ""The Law Society believes that the law on divorce should be reviewed to ensure that it is fair and proportionate. ""We will be interested to see the Supreme Court's decision in this case and how it will affect the way that divorce is dealt with in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Don Lock murder: Mother of accused pleaded for help for son,"Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility.

He swore at traffic wardens and started ""acting out"" in the street, Mrs Daley said. She said she and her husband, who died in July this year, were left ""distressed and upset."" Matthew Daley was taken to the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, where his mother says he threatened to kill a nurse.

This included aim-assist, which helps players by automatically adjusting their aim, and wallhack, which allows players to see through walls. Epic's ban of Mr Khattri has been met with mixed reactions. Some fans have defended him, arguing that he only used the cheating software on a private server and that he did not intend to gain an unfair advantage in the game. Others have welcomed the ban, arguing that it sends a strong message that cheating will not be tolerated. Epic's decision to ban Mr Khattri is part of a wider crackdown on cheating in Fortnite. The company has previously banned other high-profile players for using cheating software, and it has also implemented a number of measures to make it more difficult to cheat in the game. It is not yet clear whether Mr Khattri will appeal his ban. However, even if he does, it is unlikely that he will be successful. Epic has a strict policy against cheating, and it has shown in the past that it is willing to ban players who violate this policy, regardless of their popularity or status. The ban of Mr Khattri is a reminder that cheating is a serious problem in online gaming. It is also a reminder that even the most popular and successful players are not immune to being banned if they are caught cheating.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Elaine Doyle murder: DNA samples could give clues to death,"Detectives used sticky tape to recover fibers from the dead girl's skin and found traces of DNA from ""an unknown male"" on Elaine's back. Forensic experts believe that this may show there was a sexual assault before she was killed. The new breakthrough comes after a cold case review into Elaine's murder was launched by detectives in the Serious Crime Review Team last year. A pollen expert has also been brought in to analyze the soil found in some of her clothing. Elaine vanished in April 1980 after leaving her office at Butlins holiday camp in Ayr, South Ayrshire. Her body was found 12 days later in a field at nearby Monkton. She had been strangled and her clothes were partially burned. Over the years, police have questioned more than 100 people about her death and major searches have been carried out in the Monkton and Prestwick areas. The fresh evidence has come to light during a cold case review into her murder which was launched by detectives in the Serious Crime Review Team last year. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: ""The inquiry team is committed to carrying out a thorough and robust review of Elaine's case and is working closely with forensic experts to ensure that all lines of inquiry are fully explored. ""We are continuing to make inquiries to identify the unknown male whose DNA was recovered from Elaine's body, and to establish the circumstances surrounding her death."" Elaine's family said they were ""delighted"" that her case was being reviewed. In a statement, they said: ""For the past 40 years our thoughts and prayers have been with Elaine day and night. We have never given up hope that one day the person or people responsible for taking her from us would be caught. ""We understand that as part of the inquiry they are trying to identify the DNA and that could take a little time. We are pleased that the police have taken this step and would ask that anyone with information comes forward and speaks to the police. ""We would also like to thank the police for their continued commitment to trying to catch Elaine's killer."" Anyone with any information about Elaine's death is being asked to contact the Serious Crime Review Team on 01786 406798 or email SCDReviewTeam@scotland.police.uk",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Joe Anderson: Liverpool mayor in police probe will not seek re-election,"Mr Anderson, 62, made the announcement after Merseyside Police said he had been rebailed until February following his arrest earlier this year. He said he would continue to serve as mayor until May, when his current term ends, but would not seek re-election in May's local elections. Mr Anderson was arrested in December on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. He was released on conditional bail in January and has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, Mr Anderson said: ""I have today decided that I will not be seeking re-election as Mayor of Liverpool in May. ""This decision has not been made lightly and has been taken after careful consideration of my personal circumstances and the current political landscape. ""I am proud of the work that I have done as Mayor of Liverpool over the last seven years. ""I have overseen a period of significant investment and regeneration in our city, and I have been a strong advocate for the people of Liverpool on a national and international stage.

Rain forecast as Glastonbury Festival opens,"Fans queued outside the Somerset site from dawn on Wednesday and counted down as the pedestrian gates were opened. They face a wet weekend, with heavy downpours predicted on Thursday and a potential mudbath on Friday. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the area, with up to 40mm of rain expected to fall within six hours on Thursday afternoon. Campers have described the site as ""a quagmire"" with many resorting to wearing wellington boots. Others battled through the thick mud in bare feet, leaving trails of brown footprints in their wake. The downpours have led to some road closures and disruptions, as well as delays to the festival shuttle buses. There are also concerns that the rain could lead to flooding, so festival-goers are being advised to take precautions. Despite the weather, spirits remain high and fans are determined to make the most of the festival. Queues for the main Pyramid Stage were already forming on Wednesday afternoon, as thousands eagerly awaited the first acts of the weekend. Headline acts this year include Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, and Paul McCartney, who will perform on Saturday night. There are also a host of other acts on the bill, including Sam Fender, Elbow, and Haim. For many, Glastonbury is more than just a music festival - it's a way of life. It's a chance to escape from the everyday and immerse yourself in a world of music, art, and culture. And while the rain may not be ideal, it's unlikely to dampen the spirits of the festival-goers. After all, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as bad weather, just inappropriate clothing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tony Blair: Hard Irish border would be 'disaster',"The former UK PM said later he believed there was a ""common desire"" to make Northern Ireland a ""special case"" in Brexit negotiations. An open border had done a ""tremendous amount"" for UK and Irish trade and must be ""maintained"". ""I think one of the key things is to try to maintain a common travel area,"" Blair told the BBC, adding that a hard border would lead to smuggling and would ""damage the interests of both sides"". Blair's comments come as the UK and EU continue to negotiate the terms of the UK's exit from the bloc. The issue of the Irish border has been one of the most contentious issues in the talks, with both sides keen to avoid a hard border that could damage trade and lead to violence. The UK government has said it is committed to maintaining an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but has not yet set out how it will do so. The EU has said it is willing to consider a ""special arrangement"" for Northern Ireland, but has not yet agreed to any specific proposals. Blair's comments are likely to be welcomed by both the UK and Irish governments, who are keen to avoid a hard border. However, it remains to be seen whether the UK government will be able to come up with a solution that is acceptable to the EU. In a speech in Belfast in January, Blair said that the UK should ""stay as close as possible"" to the EU after Brexit. He said that the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union, and should continue to cooperate with the EU on issues such as security and foreign policy. Blair's comments were welcomed by some in the UK, but were criticized by others who said that he was out of touch with the public mood. The UK government has said that it will not remain in the single market or the customs union after Brexit, but has said it will seek a close relationship with the EU. It remains to be seen what kind of relationship the UK will have with the EU after Brexit. However, Blair's comments suggest that he believes that the UK should stay as close as possible to the EU, and that a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be avoided at all costs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Husband fears for her health,"Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April on spying charges, which she denies. Ratcliffe said he feared Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be forced to sign a false confession if her detention continued. ""She had quite a high-profile campaign and there's a lot of pressure to lay a charge against her,"" he told the BBC. ""My concern is, she's not very strong, she's been through a lot, and if they keep her... then she might just sign something that she doesn't really believe in."" Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention has been condemned by the British government, which has called for her immediate release. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said that he is ""deeply concerned"" about her welfare and has raised her case with his Iranian counterpart. The Iranian government has not commented on Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, but it has previously said that it does not recognize dual nationality. Ratcliffe said that he had been in contact with his wife's lawyer, who had told him that she was ""very weak"" and had lost a lot of weight. ""She's a very strong and determined person, but she's human, and I think she's now at her limits,"" he said. ""I'm very worried about her. I think she needs to come home."" Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a British-Iranian national who was born in Iran but has lived in the UK for many years. She is married to Richard Ratcliffe, a British citizen. The couple have a two-year-old daughter, Gabriella, who is being cared for by her grandparents in the UK. Ratcliffe said that he had been told by the Iranian authorities that Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be released on bail, but that this had not yet happened.

Kit Harington reveals family connection to the 'Gunpowder Plot',"Some think Guy Fawkes led the plot but it was actually Robert Catesby. Kit wanted to play his relative in the new BBC One drama Gunpowder which tells the story of the plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament on 5 November 1605. He said: ""I'm playing Robert Catesby - my great-great-great, great-great-great grandfather, 13 greats! ""He was a fascinating man. He was a committed Catholic who believed that the only way to restore the faith in England was through violence."" Catesby was a key figure in the plot, which was hatched in the wake of the persecution of Catholics by the Protestant government of King James I. Harington said he was drawn to the role because of the complex character of Catesby. ""He was a man of great faith and conviction, but he was also capable of great violence,"" he said. ""I think that's what makes him such a fascinating character to play."" Gunpowder also stars Liv Tyler as Anne Vaux, a Catholic supporter of the plot, and Mark Gatiss as Robert Cecil, the spymaster who foiled the plot. The three-part drama was written by Ronan Bennett and directed by J Blakeson. It is due to air on BBC One in the autumn. Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones. He has also starred in films such as Pompeii and Testament of Youth. Gunpowder is his first major TV role since Game of Thrones ended in 2019. In an interview with the Radio Times, Harington said he was excited to be working on a project that was so close to his heart. ""I'm really proud of this show,"" he said. ""It's a great story, and it's been told in a really exciting way.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Subsidy for non-existent flights costs Stormont £2.3m a year,"The deduction was part of the deal which allowed long-haul air passenger duty (APD) to be devolved in Northern Ireland. The decision was taken in 2013 when Stormont was sharing power with the UK government. EU rules state that subsidies for reduced air fares can only be made for flights to a specified destination, usually for economic reasons, such as establishing links to holiday destinations. The Department of Infrastructure told BBC News NI that there was a mechanism in place to claw back the money. ""A system is in place to reconcile the subsidy payments to airlines based on the actual number of passengers carried on the routes each year,"" the Department said. ""This ensures that if an airline does not meet the number of passengers projected the subsidy is reduced and repaid."" However, the subsidy is still paid in advance. The BBC understands that the funds for the current financial year were released last November, even though most of the flights linked to the subsidy have not yet taken off. The European Commission approved the subsidy on condition that the amount was gradually reduced over a period of time. The current payment of £2.3m is set to be reduced to £2.1m next year, and to £1.3m the following year. In 2020 the EU rules allowing the subsidy will expire. By that time, the total amount of money spent on the subsidy will be around £22m, of which around £15m will have been paid by Stormont. The majority of the flights supported by the subsidy are operated by United and Delta. They fly between Belfast City Airport and New York Newark, and Belfast International Airport to Orlando and New York JFK. The routes have been consistently used, with sometimes every seat sold. The argument from the airlines and DUP is that they are essential. They argue that the flights bring tourists to Northern Ireland, create jobs and allow people to travel to America for business or to visit family and friends. However, the subsidy has been criticised for being too expensive and for not being used to support new routes or services. Critics say there is a danger it is simply allowing the government to pay for existing flights that would happen anyway.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

However, this is still below the target of 95%. The Welsh government has said that it is ""deeply disappointed"" that the target has been missed again. ""We know that this is a difficult time for the NHS and we are working hard to improve performance,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have invested an extra £350m in the NHS this year and we are working with health boards to implement a number of measures to improve waiting times."" These measures include: Increasing the number of beds in hospitals Recruiting more staff Investing in new technology Improving the way that patients are discharged from hospital The Welsh government has also said that it is working with the UK government to improve the flow of patients through the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives have said that the Welsh government needs to do more to improve waiting times. ""The Welsh government has been promising to improve waiting times for years, but we are still seeing patients waiting far too long for treatment,"" said Welsh Conservative health spokesperson Angela Burns.

International GCSEs to be axed from school league tables,"The change is part of the government's overhaul of the exam system in England. New GCSEs in maths and English, which feature little or no coursework and are more challenging, will be introduced in September 2015. The government believes that the new exams will provide a better measure of pupils' achievement and will help to raise standards. However, some experts have expressed concerns that the axing of IGCSEs could lead to a narrowing of the curriculum and a reduced focus on international education. IGCSEs are currently offered in over 140 countries and are recognised by universities and employers around the world. They provide pupils with the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects, including languages, humanities and sciences, at a higher level than GCSEs. The decision to axe IGCSEs has also been criticised by some headteachers, who argue that they provide a valuable alternative to GCSEs. IGCSEs are often seen as being more rigorous than GCSEs, and they can help pupils to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in higher education and the workplace. The government has said that it will continue to support the teaching of international languages in schools, but it is not clear how this will be achieved without IGCSEs. IGCSEs are currently the only qualifications that are recognised by universities and employers as evidence of competence in a foreign language. The axing of IGCSEs is a significant change to the English education system. It is too early to say what the full impact of this change will be, but it is clear that it has the potential to have a major impact on the way that pupils are taught and assessed. In addition to the concerns raised above, there are also concerns that the axing of IGCSEs could lead to a decline in the number of pupils studying modern foreign languages. IGCSEs are currently the most popular qualifications in modern foreign languages, and they provide pupils with the opportunity to study a language in depth. Without IGCSEs, it is likely that the number of pupils studying modern foreign languages will decline, which would be a major loss for the country. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that all pupils have access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background or ability. It is important that the government takes into account the concerns that have been raised about the axing of IGCSEs and ensures that all pupils continue to have the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects, including modern foreign languages.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Neo-Nazi group led by 13-year-old boy to be banned,"By Daniel De Simone BBC News Feuerkrieg Division, an international group that largely existed online, said earlier this year it had dissolved. But Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced plans to ban it under UK anti-terror laws. The group was led by a 13-year-old boy from the United States, who allegedly recruited children as young as 10 to carry out terrorist acts. Patel said the group posed a ""grave and credible threat to the security of the UK"" and that the ban would ""make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the group, to attend its meetings, or to support it in any way"". The ban is the first time a neo-Nazi group has been proscribed in the UK since 2016, when the far-right group National Action was outlawed. Feuerkrieg Division was founded in 2018 and quickly gained a presence on social media platforms such as Telegram and Discord. The group's members shared racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda, and encouraged their followers to carry out violence against minorities. In 2020, the group was linked to a number of plots to carry out terrorist attacks, including a plan to bomb a synagogue in the US. The group's leader, who has not been identified, was arrested in 2021 and charged with a number of offences, including conspiracy to commit murder. Patel said the ban on Feuerkrieg Division was a ""necessary step to protect the public from this dangerous group"". ""We will not tolerate hatred or violence in our society,"" she said. The ban on Feuerkrieg Division has been welcomed by anti-fascist groups, who say it is a positive step in the fight against extremism. However, some civil liberties groups have expressed concern about the ban, saying it could be used to target people who hold unpopular views. The ban is expected to come into force within the next few weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Self-employed bailout ‘problematic’,"By Faisal Islam Economics editor Rishi Sunak, however, repeatedly spelt out difficulties in applying the same terms as his recent bailout for companies. With that scheme, the Treasury agreed to pay 80% of wages for furloughed staff - those whose work has dried up because their employers cannot operate. But this relies on employers having a payroll through which wages are paid to begin with. The self-employed - by definition - do not have PAYE (pay as you earn) wages from a single employer through which the government can channel this cash. HMRC has estimated that about two million self-employed people are not eligible for Universal Credit, the main benefit for low-income families and people out of work. The Chancellor hinted at more assistance to these two million self-employed workers, but without giving details. He said: ""We are also considering what more we can do to help those who are not eligible for Universal Credit."" In a sign of frustration at the lack of clarity, the Liberal Democrats proposed an interim scheme for those self-employed workers left out. They want the government to give them a taxable grant equivalent to 80% of their average monthly income over the past three years, capped at £2,500 a month, backdated to March. The Treasury said: ""We recognise that the self-employed are facing significant challenges at the moment, and we are working on a package of measures to support them."" The chancellor also confirmed that the income tax self-assessment deadline would be deferred from 31 July to 31 January next year, but said this only applied to tax payments, not to filing the tax return itself. He said this would give people more time to complete and file their tax returns. In further support of businesses, the Treasury announced: Businesses with turnover less than £1 million will get a £10,000 grant Funding increased for the small business loan scheme from £350bn to £500bn Mr Sunak also said he would increase the generosity of the loan scheme by offering loans on a 100% guarantee, rather than 80%, from Tuesday. This would be backed up by the introduction, from next week, of a ""Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme"" offering loans of up to £25 million to businesses with an annual turnover of more than £45 million. The Bank of England also cut interest rates today from 0.75% to 0.1%, their lowest level since the Bank's inception 325 years ago, in order to stimulate the economy. The governor of the Bank, Andrew Bailey, said the ""coronavirus is the biggest economic shock that the UK has faced in living memory"". But the Treasury and Bank of England are now working together to ""do whatever it takes"" to protect businesses and jobs from the impact of the outbreak.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Windows 7 hardest hit by WannaCry worm,"More than 97% of the infections seen by Kaspersky Lab and 66% of those seen by BitSight used the older software. WannaCry affected Windows computers by exploiting a flaw in the way they handled Server Message Block (SMB) requests. Microsoft had released a patch for this flaw in March, but many computers had not installed it. The WannaCry worm spread rapidly across the world, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers. It demanded a ransom payment in Bitcoin, but it is not known how many people actually paid. The attack caused widespread disruption to businesses and organisations, including the NHS in the UK. Microsoft has since released a new patch for the SMB flaw, and it is urging users to install it as soon as possible. The company has also advised users to keep their software up to date, as this can help to protect them from future attacks. Here are some additional tips to help protect your computer from malware: Use a strong password and change it regularly. Keep your software up to date. Be careful about clicking on links in emails or on websites. Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date. Back up your data regularly. By following these tips, you can help to protect your computer from malware and keep your data safe. The WannaCry worm was a wake-up call for many businesses and organisations. It showed how important it is to keep software up to date and to have a strong cyber security strategy in place. By taking the necessary steps to protect their systems, businesses and organisations can help to prevent future attacks from causing widespread disruption. In the wake of the WannaCry attack, Microsoft has taken steps to improve the security of Windows 10. The company has released a new patch for the SMB flaw, and it has also introduced a new feature called Windows Defender Exploit Guard. This feature helps to protect computers from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in software. Businesses and organisations should also consider investing in cyber security software and services.

Neil McEvoy: Commission reconsiders decision to recognise new party,"The Electoral Commission is reconsidering whether to officially register the Welsh National Party. It follows a threatened legal challenge by the current Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru. The move comes after the commission initially decided to recognise the new party, which was founded by former Plaid Cymru MP Neil McEvoy. However, Plaid Cymru has argued that the new party is too similar to its own and could cause confusion among voters. The Electoral Commission has now said that it will reconsider its decision in light of the legal threat. A spokesman for the commission said: ""We have received a letter from Plaid Cymru's lawyers setting out their concerns about the registration of the Welsh National Party. ""We are currently considering the legal arguments put forward and will make a decision on whether to reconsider our decision in due course."" The Welsh National Party was founded by McEvoy in 2021 after he left Plaid Cymru. McEvoy has said that he wants the new party to be a ""broad church"" for Welsh nationalists. However, Plaid Cymru has accused McEvoy of trying to ""steal"" its identity. The party's leader, Adam Price, has said that the Welsh National Party is ""a pale imitation"" of Plaid Cymru and that it will ""confuse voters"". The Electoral Commission's decision on whether to register the Welsh National Party is expected to be made in the coming weeks. If the commission decides to register the party, it will be able to field candidates in elections and receive public funding. However, if the commission decides not to register the party, it will not be able to do either of these things. The legal challenge from Plaid Cymru is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Welsh National Party. In 2022, the party was forced to change its name after the Electoral Commission ruled that its original name, ""Propel"", was too similar to that of another party. The party has also been criticized for its lack of transparency. In 2023, it was revealed that the party had failed to declare a donation of £25,000 from a property developer.

Soap bubble screen is 'the world's thinnest display',"An international team produced a display that uses ultrasonic sound waves to alter film's properties and create either a flat or a 3D image. The bubbles act as lenses that can focus and redirect light waves, enabling the creation of sharp images without the need for bulky and expensive hardware. The display is flexible and lightweight, making it suitable for various applications, including mobile devices, wearable displays, and medical imaging. The bubbles are created by vibrating a transducer that generates ultrasonic sound waves in a liquid solution. The sound waves cause the formation of a thin film of bubbles, which can be controlled by varying the frequency and intensity of the sound waves. The bubbles act as lenses that can focus and redirect light waves, enabling the creation of sharp images without the need for bulky and expensive hardware. The researchers believe that the soap bubble screen has the potential to revolutionise the display industry. It could lead to the development of thin, flexible, and portable displays that can be used in a wide range of applications. The technology could also be used to create 3D displays that provide a more immersive and realistic viewing experience. Dr Masaya Nishimura, from the University of Sussex, who led the research, said: ""This is a significant breakthrough in the field of display technology. We have developed a new type of display that uses soap bubbles as lenses to create images. This has the potential to lead to the development of thin, flexible, and portable displays that can be used in a wide range of applications."" The research team is now working on improving the resolution and brightness of the soap bubble display. They are also exploring ways to use the technology to create 3D displays.

Oil firms 'need fresh strategies' says PwC report,"Oil firms 'need fresh strategies' says PwC report PwC said companies should be looking to deploy fresh strategies, following a sustained fall in the price of oil. It suggested they should look to reduce costs ""in a sustainable manner"" and find efficiencies by keeping tax costs as low as possible, whilst maintaining a focus on their workforce, technology and innovation. The consultancy's report on the oil and gas industry, entitled 'Navigating the crossroads: The strategic imperative for resilience', comes at a time when some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world have been cutting costs, and in some cases jobs. In its report PwC suggests that although the oil price may recover in the future, it is unlikely to reach the peaks seen in the past and companies need to adapt their business models accordingly. The report suggested firms should become ""more agile and responsive"" by moving away from ""rigid traditional structures"" and embracing digital technology. It also suggested a focus on technology and innovation in order to ""drive efficiency, reduce costs and gain competitive advantage"". The report's author, Jonathon Holgate, said: ""The oil and gas industry is at a crossroads. The traditional models of the past are no longer sustainable. Companies need to transform their business models to ensure their long-term competitiveness."" The report also suggests that companies should focus on their workforce, ensuring that they have the skills and capabilities to adapt to the changing business landscape. PwC argues that retaining and developing talent will be critical and this can be achieved through investment in training and development, and creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. PwC's report has been welcomed by some industry experts as a useful contribution to the debate on the future of the oil and gas industry. However, others have argued that the report does not go far enough and that the industry needs to take more radical action to adapt to the changing environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Dinas Dinlle beach erosion plan unveiled,"It is believed a flood defence built to protect Dinas Dinlle near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, from coastal flooding in 1994 has made the problem worse. Environment Agency Wales was outlining its plans for tackling the problem on Wednesday. The agency said: ""The main cause of erosion at Dinas Dinlle beach is the long-term loss of sediment from the beach and dunes. ""This is caused by a combination of factors, including the natural movement of sediment along the coast, changes in wave climate, and the presence of the flood defence structure. ""The flood defence structure was built in the early 1990s to protect the village of Dinas Dinlle from flooding. However, it has had the unintended consequence of exacerbating erosion to the beach."" The agency's preferred option is to build a new rock revetment along the length of the beach. This would be a sloping structure made of large rocks, which would absorb the energy of waves and protect the beach from further erosion. The agency said that the revetment would be ""sympathetic to the surrounding environment"" and would not have a significant impact on the visual amenity of the area. The agency is currently consulting on its plans and will be holding a public exhibition at Dinas Dinlle village hall on Thursday 12 July. Residents have welcomed the agency's plans. Clive Williams, who has lived in Dinas Dinlle for over 50 years, said: ""The erosion has been a real problem for the village. We've lost a lot of beach and the dunes are getting smaller.

London Underground: How does the Tube compare globally?,"By Nick Tarver BBC News Transport for London (TfL) has announced that every ticket office on the Tube is to shut by 2022. The move is part of a wider plan to modernize the network and make it more efficient. TfL says that ticket offices are no longer needed as the majority of passengers now use contactless payment or Oyster cards. The closure of ticket offices has been met with mixed reactions. Some passengers have welcomed the move, saying that it will make the network more streamlined and efficient. Others have expressed concern that it will make it more difficult for people to buy tickets, particularly those who are not familiar with using contactless payment or Oyster cards. TfL has said that it will provide additional support for passengers who need help buying tickets. This will include staff on hand at stations to help people use contactless payment or Oyster cards, and machines that will allow people to buy tickets using cash. The closure of ticket offices is just one of a number of changes that are being made to the Tube network. TfL is also investing in new trains, signaling systems, and stations. These changes are all part of a wider plan to improve the reliability, capacity, and frequency of services on the Tube. The Tube is one of the oldest and most iconic public transport systems in the world. It was first opened in 1863 and has since grown to become one of the busiest metro systems in the world. The Tube carries over 1 billion passengers every year and is an essential part of London's transport network. The Tube compares favorably to other metro systems around the world. It is generally clean, safe, and reliable. However, it is also one of the most expensive metro systems in the world. A single journey on the Tube can cost up to £5.60, which is more than the cost of a single journey on the New York City Subway or the Paris Métro. Despite its high cost, the Tube remains a popular and convenient way to travel around London. It is a fast, efficient, and reliable way to get from one place to another. The closure of ticket offices is unlikely to have a major impact on the Tube's popularity or convenience.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
European Commission predicts 'turning point' in Europe,"The Commission said there were ""signs of hope"" that had started to turn into ""tangible positive outcomes"". But in the eurozone - which uses the euro currency - growth is expected to be slower than in the EU as a whole. The Commission predicts that the eurozone will grow by 1.9% this year, and by 1.7% in 2024. This is slower than the EU's overall growth rate, which is expected to be 2.7% this year and 2.6% in 2024. The Commission said that the slower growth in the eurozone is due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine, high energy prices, and supply chain disruptions. The Commission also said that the EU's public finances are improving. The EU's budget deficit is expected to fall from 5.0% of GDP in 2022 to 3.9% of GDP in 2023, and to 3.6% of GDP in 2024. This is due to a number of factors, including the strong economic growth, and the EU's efforts to reduce its spending. The Commission said that the EU's debt-to-GDP ratio is also expected to fall, from 95.5% of GDP in 2022 to 91.8% of GDP in 2023, and to 89.6% of GDP in 2024. This is due to the EU's efforts to reduce its debt, and the strong economic growth. The Commission said that the EU's economy is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The Commission predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 2.8% in 2025, and by 2.9% in 2026. This is due to a number of factors, including the expected recovery in the eurozone, the strong global economy, and the EU's ongoing efforts to reform its economy. The Commission said that the EU's economy is facing a number of challenges, including the war in Ukraine, high energy prices, and supply chain disruptions. However, the Commission said that it is confident that the EU's economy will continue to grow in the coming years. The Commission said that the EU is ""well-placed to weather the current challenges and emerge stronger"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Second footballer comes forward over abuse at Crewe Alexandra,"Steve Walters - who was the club's youngest debutant in 1988 - has spoken to the Guardian newspaper. Ex-Crewe player Andy Woodward has also waived his anonymity to speak about the abuse he suffered at the club. Walters said he was abused by a coach when he was a teenager. He said the abuse took place over a period of two years and that he felt unable to speak out at the time. ""I was a young boy and I didn't know what to do,"" he said. ""I was scared and I didn't want to rock the boat."" Walters said he eventually told his parents about the abuse and they reported it to the police. However, he said the police did not take any action. ""I felt let down by the police,"" he said. ""I felt like they didn't believe me."" Walters said he is now speaking out to help other victims of abuse. He said he wants to show that they are not alone and that they can get help. ""I want to help other people who have been through the same thing,"" he said. ""I want them to know that they are not alone and that they can get help."" Crewe Alexandra has said it is ""deeply concerned"" by the allegations and that it is investigating them. The club said it is committed to providing a safe environment for all its players and that it will take any necessary action to protect them. ""We are deeply concerned by the allegations that have been made,"" a club spokesman said. ""We are investigating them and we will take any necessary action to protect our players."" The Football Association (FA) has also said it is investigating the allegations. The FA said it is committed to protecting children and that it will take any necessary action to ensure that they are safe. ""We are aware of the allegations that have been made and we are investigating them,"" an FA spokesman said. ""We are committed to protecting children and we will take any necessary action to ensure that they are safe."" The allegations come at a time when the FA is facing increasing pressure to do more to protect children from abuse. In recent months, a number of former players have come forward to speak about the abuse they suffered at football clubs. The FA has said it is committed to working with clubs to ensure that all players are safe. The FA has also said it is working with the government to develop new legislation to protect children from abuse.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Saudi blogger Raif Badawi flogging postponed second time,"No reason has been given, but last week Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first round of 50 lashes. Mr Badawi's flogging was to have been carried out in public after Friday prayers outside a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, but witnesses said it did not take place. Saudi authorities have not commented on the postponement. Mr Badawi was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after being convicted of insulting Islam on his blog. His case has drawn widespread international condemnation, with human rights groups describing the punishment as ""cruel and inhuman"". The United Nations and the European Union have both called for Mr Badawi's release, and the United States has expressed ""deep concern"" about his case. Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, who lives in Canada with their three children, has welcomed the postponement of the flogging. However, she said she was still concerned about her husband's health. ""I am very worried about Raif's physical and mental health,"" she told the BBC. ""He has been through a lot in the last few weeks, and I don't know how much more he can take."" Mr Badawi's flogging has been condemned by a number of prominent figures, including the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond. Mr Hammond said the punishment was ""barbaric"" and ""an outrage"". The Saudi authorities have defended the sentence, saying it was in accordance with Islamic law. However, human rights groups argue that the punishment is cruel and inhuman, and that it violates international law. Mr Badawi's case has highlighted the issue of freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia. The country has a long history of suppressing dissent, and journalists, bloggers and activists are often arrested and imprisoned for expressing their views. In recent years, there have been some signs of progress on human rights in Saudi Arabia. In 2013, the country adopted a new law that criminalises torture. However, the law does not apply to flogging, and human rights groups say that torture is still widespread in Saudi prisons.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pound falls as Theresa May indicates Brexit date,"It also hit its lowest level against the dollar since the beginning of July. On Sunday, the prime minister said she would trigger Article 50, the clause needed to start the process, by the end of March next year. The news prompted a flurry of activity in the foreign exchange market, with investors eager to protect themselves from any uncertainty that may arise during the Brexit negotiations. ""The pound has been under pressure for some time now, as investors have been worried about the impact of Brexit on the UK economy,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""The latest comments from Theresa May have only added to those concerns, and we could see further falls in the pound in the coming days and weeks."" The pound's decline has been particularly pronounced against the euro, which has gained around 10% against the pound since the UK voted to leave the EU. This is partly due to the fact that the eurozone economy is seen as being more stable than the UK economy, and partly because investors are betting that the UK will be forced to make concessions to the EU in order to secure a favourable Brexit deal. The pound's weakness is a concern for the UK government, as it could lead to higher inflation and make it more difficult for businesses to compete in the global market. The government has said that it is committed to maintaining the UK's economic stability, and it is likely to take steps to support the pound if it continues to fall. However, it is important to note that the pound's decline is not a one-way street. It is possible that the pound could recover some of its losses if the Brexit negotiations go smoothly and if the UK economy shows signs of improvement. Ultimately, the future of the pound will depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the broader economic outlook.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ikea looks set to open more small stores in the UK,"UK boss Javier Quinones said the London shop was a ""learning experiment"" but its success meant the format was likely to expand to other UK cities. The concept allows people to order and design their furniture online before picking it up in-store, removing the need for large storage facilities. Instead, smaller stores have the space to display more products and offer workshops and other services. Quinones told the BBC: ""The store has been incredibly successful. It's proven itself as a very relevant concept. ""We have had incredibly positive reactions from customers and colleagues. It's really giving a better service, a more convenient service."" He added that the new format could be particularly useful in locations where space was at a premium, such as city centres. ""It means we can bring Ikea to even more people,"" he said. The move by Ikea follows a similar trend in the retail sector, with other big brands such as Amazon and John Lewis also opening smaller stores in recent years. These smaller stores are typically located in urban areas and offer a more curated selection of products, as well as services such as click-and-collect and online ordering. Analysts say that the smaller stores are helping to revitalise the retail sector by making it more convenient for customers to shop in person. The Ikea store in London's Hammersmith district opened in 2019 and has been a success ever since. It spans 10,000 sq ft, compared to the average 30,000 sq ft of a traditional Ikea store. In addition to the smaller footprint, the London store also has a different layout, with more products on display and fewer self-assembly options. Customers can order their furniture online before picking it up in-store, or they can use the store's planning service to design their own furniture. The store also offers a range of services, including workshops, cookery classes, and a restaurant. The success of the London store has led Ikea to consider opening more small stores in the UK. The company is currently looking at potential locations in other major cities, including Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Auschwitz victim Jane Haining's relatives attend reunion,"The recently discovered document offers fresh insight into the life of Jane Haining from Dunscore. In total some 14 of her relatives attended the event in Edinburgh. One of them, Catriona Routledge, said she thought it would be fascinating to learn more about her great-great-aunt, adding: ""I'm so glad we are able to do this at long last."" ""We remember her as Aunty Jane and we know she used to send wee parcels to her family back home,"" Catriona said. ""We did not know about the extent she cared for the children."" Another great-great-niece, Morag Pollard said: ""My grandfather and his brother, the sons of Jane Haining's sister, were brought up as if they were Jane's own children. ""They were looked after by the family while their mother died when they were young. ""They did not talk about it too much but what I did gather is that they were happy times."" Rev Iain MacDonald from Jane Haining's home church said she was ""an extraordinary woman. ""She was one in thousands of people who were caught up in circumstances that they did not have any control over,"" he said. ""For her to have the courage to go and help and then to stay when everyone was wanting her to go back makes her quite an extraordinary woman. ""She was a remarkable person."" The document states that Jane Haining came to the sanctuary to make a deliberate decision to stay. It shows that she was ""not prepared to leave the girls under any circumstances whatsoever."" Catriona Routledge said: ""We knew all along that she stayed to look after the children but we did not know that she made a conscious decision to do so. ""It might have been more courageous than we thought."" A memorial to Jane Haining was erected in Dunscore in 1995 and she is set to be honoured with a permanent display in the Museum of Edinburgh dedicated to her life. The current exhibition there has been visited by more than 50,000 people. A film has also been made to tell the story of Jane Haining. Entitled For Those I Loved, it charts the story of her work in Budapest and the circumstances of how she went to Auschwitz.

Three-point turn may be dropped from UK driving test,"Under a revised practical exam, learners may also be asked to use a satellite navigation system instead of following road signs. About 1,000 learners will take part in a trial of the new test from June 2023, with the changes potentially being introduced by 2024. The current three-point turn manoeuvre may be scrapped, as sat navs become the norm and new cars fitted with reversing cameras and sensors. Other changes being considered include reversing into a parking bay and maneuvering at junctions, such as roundabouts. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said the changes are being considered to ensure the driving test ""remains relevant and up to date"". It comes after a review of the current test found that it does not ""sufficiently reflect the demands of modern driving"". The DVSA said the changes are not a ""watering down"" of the test, but rather a ""modernisation"" to reflect the way people drive today. The three-point turn has been a staple of the UK driving test for decades, but it is becoming increasingly less relevant as more and more drivers rely on sat navs. Sat navs can provide clear and concise directions, which can be helpful for drivers who are unfamiliar with an area. They can also help drivers to avoid getting lost, which can be a stressful experience. The DVSA said that the decision on whether or not to remove the three-point turn from the test will be made after the trial has been completed. The trial will assess the impact of the changes on the safety and competence of new drivers. It will also consider the views of learner drivers, driving instructors, and other stakeholders. The changes to the driving test are part of a wider effort to improve road safety in the UK. The government has set a target of reducing the number of road deaths and serious injuries by 40% by 2030. The DVSA said that the changes to the driving test will help to contribute to this target by ensuring that new drivers are better prepared for the challenges of modern driving.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Homeless mental health and drugs services 'broken' in Wales,"By Daniel Davies BBC Wales, Correspondent Funding is too low to cope with a ""rough sleeping crisis"" in Wales, according to a committee report which also cited a lack of leadership. Charities want ""radical action"", including extra money to deliver better drug and alcohol services. The Welsh government said it was committed to addressing homelessness. The Senedd's health committee found a ""lack of coherent and cohesive leadership"" in homelessness and mental health services. Urgent action needed, say homelessness charities Jenny Rathbone MS, chair of the health committee, said: ""Despite some good work by individuals and organisations, overall progress on tackling homelessness is too slow and inconsistent across Wales. ""In particular, we are concerned about the lack of co-ordination and leadership that exists at a local and regional level."" The committee found that statutory guidance and regulation was ""too weak"" and was not followed consistently. ""Consequently, a range of services are not operating to required standards,"" the report said. Its findings come at a time when homelessness in Wales is at a record high. Official figures show an 11% increase in the number sleeping rough in December 2022 compared to the same time in 2021. In 2023, 350 people were counted sleeping on the streets. The committee said that ""piecemeal"" work by councils and the voluntary sector ""cannot be a substitute for a co-ordinated, more consistent and transformative approach"". It has called on the Welsh government, local authorities, and health boards to ""collaborate to develop a 10-year strategy to end rough sleeping"". The report also said investment in addiction and mental health services was ""far too low"". ""We consider this to be wholly inadequate given the high levels of substance misuse and mental health problems among the homeless population,"" it added. Dr Patrick Kitley, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Wales, said: ""We need a radical approach to our drug and alcohol services. ""This must be embedded within broader homelessness services with a focus on recovery."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, said: ""The homelessness crisis and the lack of suitable provision of mental health and drug and alcohol services have gone on for far too long."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to addressing homelessness and providing support for those who need it most. ""The Tackling Homelessness Action Plan sets out our plan to deliver our commitment to end rough sleeping in Wales by 2030."" The spokesperson said it was ""committed to supporting people who are homeless for whatever reason"" and it provided more than £20m annually to local authorities to support them. ""We will continue to work collaboratively with health boards, the homelessness sector and others to deliver the right support for people who are homeless.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Police 'outnumbered' by Middlesbrough and Newcastle sledging crowds,"Large crowds congregated to frolic on Newcastle's Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough on Wednesday and Thursday. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings but the rules do not apply for spontaneous gatherings, which these events were deemed to be.  However, on Wednesday evening, a large crowd gathered on the Town Moor to celebrate the easing of lockdown. Police were called to disperse the crowd, which was estimated to be around 1,000 people. However, the size of the crowd meant that the police were outnumbered. The police were unable to disperse the crowd and they eventually left.  On Thursday evening, a similar crowd gathered on Flatts Lane Country Park. Again, the police were called to disperse the crowd, but they were again outnumbered. The police were able to disperse the crowd after a short time, but not before several people had been injured.  The police have said that they are disappointed with the behaviour of those who gathered on the Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park. They have said that they will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with such gatherings in the future.  The gatherings on the Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park are a reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. It is important to remember that social distancing measures are still in place and that we must all do our part to prevent the spread of the virus.  The police have said that they will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with such gatherings in the future. They have said that they will be issuing fines to those who break the rules and that they will use their powers to disperse gatherings if necessary.  The police have urged the public to cooperate with them and to follow the rules.

MPs doubt supermarket scheme to spot carers,"By Rebecca Keating BBC News Sainsbury's has begun training staff to look for signs that customers may be caring for elderly or disabled people. They are told to give those doing two lots of shopping at once, or struggling to manage heavy bags, a little extra help. But some MPs fear the supermarket giant is only doing this to boost profits, by aiming to sell more products to carers. The retailer said its staff would be ""discreet and sensitive"" when approaching customers, and would only offer help if it was clear that it was needed. Customers would not be asked about their personal circumstances, Sainsbury's said. The move is part of a wider initiative by the supermarket to help vulnerable customers. Staff are also being trained to identify people who may be lonely or isolated. Sainsbury's said it had listened to feedback from carers and other groups, and had designed the scheme to be as non-intrusive as possible. However, some MPs have expressed concerns about the scheme. Labour's Barbara Keeley said she was worried that it could be used to target carers with marketing campaigns. ""I think it's a bit patronising and actually, it might be counter-productive,"" she said. ""If people feel like they're being targeted, they might be less likely to come forward and ask for help."" Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said she was ""a little bit sceptical"" about the scheme. ""I think it's great that Sainsbury's are trying to help vulnerable customers, but I just worry that this could be a way of them trying to sell more products,"" she said. Sainsbury's said it was ""committed to supporting carers"" and that the scheme was ""not about selling more products"". ""This is about helping people who are struggling to do their shopping,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're not going to be asking people about their personal circumstances. We're just going to be offering them a little bit of extra help if we think they need it."" The scheme is being piloted in 20 stores across the UK. If successful, it could be rolled out to all of Sainsbury's 600 stores.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Supreme Court to hear transgender school bathroom case,"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The district claims this is necessary to protect the privacy of cisgender girls, but the student argues it is discriminatory. The case is being closely watched as a potential landmark ruling on the rights of transgender people. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination, but it has not yet ruled on the specific issue of transgender bathroom access. A decision in favor of the school district could set a precedent for other schools to ban transgender students from using the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Conversely, a decision in favor of the student could provide greater protection for transgender students nationwide. The case is also being seen as a test of the Trump administration's stance on transgender rights. The administration has rolled back several Obama-era protections for transgender people, and it has signaled that it does not believe that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in March 2023. A decision is expected by the end of June. In addition to the legal issues involved, the case has also sparked a broader debate about the rights of transgender people. Some argue that transgender people should be able to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, while others believe that this could lead to safety concerns for cisgender people. The debate is likely to continue regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case. However, the Court's ruling will likely have a significant impact on the lives of transgender people across the United States.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Family of man shot dead by sheriff's deputy awarded $4 damages,"Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr was shot through his garage door on 14 January 2014 by the deputy in St Lucie County, Florida, while his hands were up. His family has now been awarded $4 in damages after an eight-year legal battle. The fatal shooting happened as Hill opened his garage door as the deputy was looking for someone else. The deputy claimed to have mistaken his phone for a gun. Body camera footage of the incident was released by the sheriff's office in 2017. It showed Hill opening his garage door and raising his hands in the air as the deputy fired four shots through it. Hill's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the sheriff's office in 2015. The case went to trial in 2019, but a federal jury found that the deputy did not use excessive force. The family appealed the verdict and in April 2022, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence. The court ordered a new trial on the issue of whether the deputy used excessive force. In November 2022, the family reached a settlement with the sheriff's office for $4. The settlement was approved by a federal judge on 10 January 2023. Hill's family said they were ""disappointed"" with the amount of damages they were awarded. ""We feel like our son's life was worth more than $4,"" Hill's mother, Beatrice Hill, said. ""But we're grateful that we were able to get some justice for him."" The sheriff's office said it was ""pleased"" that the case had been resolved. ""We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable,"" a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said. The settlement comes after a string of high-profile police killings of unarmed black men in the United States. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform. In response to the outcry, some police departments have begun to adopt new policies, such as requiring officers to wear body cameras and to de-escalate situations before using force. However, critics say that more needs to be done to address the issue of police brutality. They argue that the $4 settlement in Hill's case is a sign that the justice system is still failing black victims of police violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Research by the RAC found that one in five drivers admitted to using social media while driving in the past year. The survey also found that drivers who used social media at the wheel were more likely to have been involved in a crash in the past five years. Chief Constable Davenport said: ""We need to do more to educate drivers about the dangers of using social media at the wheel. ""It's not just about the risk of crashing, it's also about the fact that it can distract you from other hazards on the road."" The RAC is calling for tougher penalties for drivers who use social media at the wheel. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""We believe that using social media at the wheel should be treated as seriously as drink driving. ""We want the government to introduce a specific offence for using social media while driving, with a minimum penalty of a £200 fine and six points on your licence."" Chief Constable Davenport said she supports the RAC's call for tougher penalties. ""We need to send a clear message that using social media at the wheel is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We will continue to work with our partners to educate drivers about the dangers of this behaviour and we will also be taking enforcement action against those who break the law.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
West Coast Main Line bid probe 'must be external',"The decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup was scrapped over ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government has since announced a review of what went wrong, but Labour says this should not be carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT). Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said an external probe was needed to restore trust in the process. ""The botched West Coast Main Line competition has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermined trust in the government's ability to run a fair and transparent bidding process,"" he said. ""An internal DfT review into what went wrong simply won't cut it. The public needs to know that the government is taking this seriously and that lessons will be learned to prevent the same mistakes happening again. ""The only way to achieve this is through an independent external review."" The DfT has said it will ""carefully consider"" Labour's request. A spokesman said: ""We are conducting a thorough review of the West Coast Main Line bidding process to understand what went wrong and learn lessons for the future. ""We will carefully consider Labour's request for an external review and respond in due course."" The West Coast Main Line is one of the busiest railway lines in the UK, running from London Euston to Glasgow Central. The franchise to operate the line was awarded to FirstGroup in August 2022, but the decision was scrapped in October 2022 after the DfT found ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government has since announced a review of the process, which is being led by former civil servant Keith Williams.

"Children need more exercise - especially girls, study says","By Nick Triggle Health correspondent, BBC News University College London researchers found just 51% of the 6,500 children they monitored achieved the recommended hour of physical activity each day. For girls, the figure was just 38%, compared with 63%. They say girls are more reluctant to take part in activities that will make them sweaty, messy or put them at risk of injury. And for both boys and girls, after-school clubs and family outings play a key role in ""topping up"" children's activity levels. The research, published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal, is the largest of its kind, and tracks activity in 11-12 year olds from 12 countries, including the UK, US, Belgium and Australia. The World Health Organization recommends children aged five to 17 years should do at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day, to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. But the study found that around half (49%) of children across the globe were falling short. ""The good news is that across all of the countries, over 80% of children were managing at least some physical activity,"" said Prof Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study. ""But the bad news is that it's not enough."" The study used accelerometers - worn on the wrist like a watch - to measure children's activity. ""What we found was, girls were much less active than boys. On average, they did 25 minutes less activity per day,"" said Prof Viner. ""There are a number of factors at play - girls are more likely to spend time at home, playing video games or watching TV, and they are more concerned about getting messy or sweaty."" ""And doing strenuous activities can be painful for girls, because they may be beginning to develop breasts."" The study also found that activity levels varied widely between countries - with children in Australia and New Zealand the most active and those in Colombia, Brazil and South Africa the least active. One of the reasons for this was the time spent on ""active travel"". ""Children in New Zealand and Australia were much more likely to walk or cycle to school,"" said Prof Viner. ""And going to school and walking home provide kids with an easy way to top up their daily activity level."" The study also found that watching TV and playing video games can reduce activity levels by the equivalent of one to two hours per day. ""But while screen time is important, what really concerns us is the children who are not doing any structured activity,"" said Prof Viner. ""It's really important that we find ways to increase physical activity in children. And that means encouraging them to take part in activities that they enjoy, and making sure there are safe places for them to play.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Italy coalition: Thousands rally in Rome against cuts,"Wielding red flags and placards, they urged the centre-left Prime Minister, Enrico Letta, to scrap austerity measures and focus on job creation. Public trust in his fragile coalition with the centre-right is dropping, opinion polls suggest. ""We're here today to tell the government to stop killing us,"" said one protester, Livia Albertini, a retired teacher. ""We want them to stop cutting education, health and public services. We want them to start investing in jobs and the future."" The protest was called by the largest Italian trade union, the CGIL, as well as several leftist parties and social movements. They say that the government's austerity measures are hitting the poor and working class the hardest, while the rich and powerful continue to get richer. ""This government is making the rich richer and the poor poorer,"" said Susanna Camusso, the leader of the CGIL. ""We cannot accept this anymore. We need a change of course."" The government has defended its austerity measures, saying they are necessary to reduce Italy's high debt and deficit. But critics say the measures are too harsh and are causing unnecessary hardship. ""These cuts are killing people,"" said Antonio Lai, a disabled protester. ""I'm here to fight for my rights and the rights of all disabled people. We cannot afford to lose any more."" The protest comes at a time of growing public discontent in Italy. The government's popularity has plummeted in recent months, and there is increasing speculation that it could collapse. A recent opinion poll found that only 29% of Italians approve of the government's performance. Dissatisfaction with the government is particularly high among young people, who are struggling to find jobs and afford housing. The government is facing a difficult balancing act. It needs to reduce the deficit while also addressing the needs of the population. If it fails to do so, it could face a wave of protests and instability.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Betsi health board chief criticises 'misleading' Tawel Fan claims,"It made major criticisms but found no evidence of institutional abuse at the now-closed Tawel Fan ward for dementia patients at Glan Clwyd Hospital. Some politicians and some families had claimed that abuse on the ward was widespread and systematic. The independent inquiry into the ward was ordered by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in 2020. It was chaired by former High Court judge Wyn Williams QC. Its report found there was no evidence to back up the claims of abuse, but it did find there were many problems on the ward, which has now been closed. In a hard-hitting report, it concluded that the board's governance arrangements ""required significant improvement"". It also said the board had failed to respond adequately to concerns and complaints about the ward. In response to the report, a spokesman for the health board said it had accepted ""all the findings and recommendations in the report and is already taking action to address each one"". The report made 24 recommendations to the health board, including: Improve its governance arrangements Respond more effectively to concerns and complaints Improve safeguarding arrangements Improve staffing levels and training Establish an independent body to provide assurance that improvements are being made. In a statement, the Welsh government said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the findings of the report. It said it was working with the health board to ensure that the recommendations were implemented. The report comes after a series of allegations of abuse at the ward. In 2019, a BBC Wales investigation revealed that a number of patients had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. The health board initially denied the allegations, but later apologized and launched an internal investigation. The independent inquiry was commissioned to investigate the allegations in more detail. It heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including patients, their families, and staff. The report concluded that there was no evidence to support the claims of institutional abuse. However, it did find that there were a number of problems on the ward, including: Understaffing Poor communication Lack of training A culture of fear The report also found that the health board had failed to respond adequately to concerns and complaints about the ward. It said the board had a ""defensive and dismissive approach"" to concerns raised by families and staff. In response to the report, the health board has said it has accepted all the findings and recommendations. It has also apologized to the families of patients who suffered poor care on the ward. The report is a damning indictment of the health board. It shows that the board failed to protect some of the most vulnerable people in its care. The board must now take action to implement the recommendations of the report and ensure that such abuses can never happen again.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
TEDGlobal: Burns portrait comes alive at TED,"By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter, TEDGlobal, Edinburgh The demonstration was part of a session at the TEDGlobal (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference dedicated to makers and DIY-ers. With a nod to the talking portraits at Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the portrait of Robert Burns started to move and speak after Farrow put on a pair of special glasses. Farrow, who describes himself as a ""digital artist and necromancer"" - someone who brings the dead back to life with technology - said that using his glasses, the portrait ""becomes a window into some parallel universe"". ""I'm using a camera to film my video and then I'm projecting it back on to the painting,"" he explained. ""It's all real time. There are no pre-recorded videos. Instead, my software is analysing the video of my face and neck and then mapping that on to the painting. ""This technology has been around for years in films and the video game industry but I wanted to see if it could be used in a different way. ""This is the first time that I've used it with a portrait. I'm really interested in the use of artificial intelligence. Can we use computers to bring dead people back to life? Can I upload my brain to the cloud? ""If I could, I would want to be like Tupac. I would want to be a rapping ghost."" Farrow's work may seem like a gimmick, but he said that it could have a serious use in the future. ""I can see this technology being used for historical figures,"" he said. ""Imagine a museum where you can put on a pair of glasses and see Churchill making a speech. Or you could watch Neil Armstrong walking on the moon."" ""I think it's a really exciting and powerful way to connect with the past."" The audience at TEDGlobal seemed impressed with Farrow's work. Afterwards, many people queued up to put on the glasses and see the portrait of Burns for themselves. One person said that it was ""like magic"". Farrow's work is a reminder that technology is constantly evolving and that we are only just beginning to explore its possibilities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe,"Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, he was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the pair had a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to ""deepen the European Union"". Mr Macron's speech was titled ""For a Democratic and Sovereign Europe"", and he laid out his plans for a ""rebirth of Europe"" based on three key principles: a sovereign, united Europe; a more democratic Europe; and a Europe that is ""open to the world"". On the first point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to become more independent and less reliant on others. He called for a ""European defence force"" to protect the continent from external threats, and for a ""European energy union"" to reduce dependence on Russian gas. On the second point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to become more democratic and accountable to its citizens. He called for a ""European citizens' initiative"" to give people a greater say in EU decision-making, and for a ""European Parliament that is truly representative of the people"". On the third point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to be more open to the world. He called for a ""European trade policy that is fair and ambitious"", and for a ""European immigration policy that is humane and effective"". Mr Macron's speech was well-received by the German audience, and it was seen as a sign that he is serious about reforming the EU. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to convince other EU leaders to follow his lead. Ms Merkel, who has been a close ally of Mr Macron, said that she shared his ""vision for Europe"". She said that the EU was ""at a crossroads"" and that it was time to ""take bold steps"" to reform it. The speech comes at a time when the EU is facing a number of challenges, including the rise of populism, the threat of terrorism, and the ongoing migration crisis. Mr Macron's speech was seen as an attempt to provide a positive vision for the future of Europe and to reassure people that the EU can meet these challenges. However, it remains to be seen whether Mr Macron will be able to convince other EU leaders to follow his lead. The EU is a complex institution, and it is difficult to get all 28 member states to agree on anything.

China 'to survey disputed East China Sea islands',"State news agency Xinhua said the survey was part of China's ""programme to safeguard its maritime rights and interests"". The islands are controlled by Japan, which refers to them as the Senkakus, but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyus. The move comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over the islands, which are located in an area believed to be rich in natural resources. Beijing's announcement on Tuesday (19 July) confirmed the survey had started near the disputed islands the previous day. Japan has lodged a formal protest with China, saying the survey was ""unacceptable"" and a violation of its territorial waters. Tokyo said it had dispatched patrol ships and aircraft to the area to monitor the Chinese activity. China's foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said the survey was a ""routine"" operation, carried out in waters under China's jurisdiction. He urged Japan to ""immediately stop its illegal activities"", and respect China's sovereignty. The Diaoyu/Senkaku islands are a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, about 200km (124 miles) north-east of Taiwan. They have been under Japanese control since 1895, but China claims they were first discovered by Chinese sailors in the 14th Century. The dispute over the islands has escalated in recent years, with both countries sending ships and aircraft to patrol the area. The islands are thought to be surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially valuable oil and gas reserves. The survey by China is likely to further increase tensions between the two countries, which are also at odds over a number of other issues, including their respective claims to parts of the South China Sea. The United States has urged both China and Japan to resolve their dispute peacefully, and has said it would not take sides in the matter. The US has also said that it has no view on the ultimate sovereignty of the islands, and that it expects both sides to avoid actions that could escalate tensions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
First peek at Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play,"By Amelia Butterly Newsbeat reporter Published on Pottermore, JK Rowling's Harry Potter website, the images show a young boy in a nest. The photos also show an older boy, said to be an adult Harry Potter, talking to a bearded man thought to be Ron Weasley. The photographs have fuelled speculation that the play, which is set 19 years after the end of the Harry Potter series, will focus on one of Harry's children. But the latest information released on the play's official website suggests Harry and Ron will have a more prominent role in the production. The full synopsis reads: ""While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. ""As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places."" The synopsis indicates that not everything is plain sailing for Harry and his family in later life. Fans will get a chance to find out what Harry has been up to since the Battle of Hogwarts when the play opens at the Palace Theatre in London's West End on 30 July 2016. While little has been revealed about the plot of the play, speculation is already rife among Potter fans. Some fans have suggested that Albus, Harry's youngest son, will struggle to live up to his family name. Others have speculated that the play will explore the relationship between Harry and his rival Draco Malfoy, whose son Scorpius will also be attending Hogwarts. Whatever the plot, the play is sure to be a major event in the Harry Potter calendar. Tickets for the play went on sale in October 2015 and sold out within hours.

'Scrap ban' on term-time holidays,"By Hannah Richardson BBC News education reporter Since September last year, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take children out of school for unauthorised absences. But the Local Government Association says the ""zero-tolerance"" approach for term-time holidays has resulted in ""huge"" variations in fines across the country. And campaigners argue that the rules are unfair, disproportionately affecting poorer families. In theory, local authorities are supposed to issue a fixed penalty notice (FPN) of £60, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 28 days, and possibly a fine of up to £1,000 for non-payment. However, a BBC investigation has found some are not issuing any fines, while others issue penalties of up to £2,500 in some cases. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was ""disappointing"" that ""very small number of parents continue to take their children out of school without authorisation - and that there is a ""small but significant variation in enforcement."" Here are some key points: Fining parents for taking their children out of school during term time is a hot topic at the moment, with strong opinions on both sides of the debate. The government introduced a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to term-time holidays in September 2013, and since then, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take their children out of school for unauthorised absences. However, there is a huge variation in fines across the country, with some councils issuing no fines at all and others issuing fines of up to £2,500. The Local Government Association says this is because the government has not provided clear guidance on how to enforce the new rules. Campaigners argue that the new rules are unfair, disproportionately affecting poorer families. The government says it is ""disappointing"" that a very small number of parents continue to take their children out of school without authorisation, and that there is a small but significant variation in enforcement. Only 10 councils out of 128 in England issued more than 1,000 fines for absence last year, according to the LGA. A handful, including Hartlepool and Bristol, issued no fines at all. The LGA, which represents more than 370 local councils, said there was ""confusion and inconsistency"" about how the rules should be enforced. ""It's unworkable and unfair on families,"" he said. ""The system needs urgent reform.""

The pair were searching a field near Hearsall Common, close to the Hearsall Hangar community centre in Coventry, when they found the platinum band. It had the name ""Jan"" engraved inside, as well as the date the couple married in 1977. ""I could tell it was a wedding ring, it's quite a distinctive pattern,"" Mr Moore said.

VW US sales rise despite scandal,"On Monday US regulators said an extra 800,000 cars had been identified as using devices that concealed emission levels during testing. The carmaker sold 30,387 cars in October, a rise of 6.6% on the same period last year. It was the third month in a row that sales have increased. The company's US chief executive Hinrich Woebcken said October's results were ""encouraging"". However, the firm still faces a number of challenges, including a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice and a class action lawsuit filed by owners of affected vehicles. Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with software, known as a ""defeat device"", that allowed them to cheat on emissions tests. The scandal has cost the company billions of dollars in fines and compensation, and has led to the resignation of its chief executive Martin Winterkorn. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ordered Volkswagen to recall nearly 500,000 vehicles. The company has also agreed to pay a $4.3bn (£2.8bn) fine for violating environmental regulations. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen's US sales have remained relatively strong. The company has been offering incentives to customers, such as zero-percent financing and cash rebates. It has also been promoting its new models, such as the redesigned Tiguan SUV and the all-electric e-Golf. Volkswagen's US sales chief Mark McNabb said that the company was ""pleased"" with October's results. However, he acknowledged that the company still faces a ""number of challenges"".

"Women still do more household chores than men, ONS finds","The Office for National Statistics said that, when it came to unpaid chores at home, women were doing almost 40% more than men on average. Men averaged 16 hours a week on unpaid work in the home, compared with women's 22 hours. The ONS data showed a small improvement on the previous year, when the gap was 41%. However, the data also showed that the share of unpaid work done by women had not changed significantly since the early 1990s. The figures come from the ONS's annual Time Use Survey, which asks people about how they spend their time. The survey found that women were more likely to do unpaid chores such as: Cleaning Cooking Laundry Childcare Caring for elderly or disabled relatives Men were more likely to do unpaid chores such as: DIY Gardening Car maintenance The ONS said that the gender gap in unpaid work was ""partly due to the fact that women are more likely to work part-time or have caring responsibilities"". However, the ONS also said that ""gender stereotypes and expectations"" may play a role. The ONS data also showed that the gender gap in unpaid work was wider among younger people. Women aged 25-34 did an average of 25 hours of unpaid work a week, compared with 17 hours for men of the same age. The gender gap in unpaid work has been declining in recent decades, but progress has been slow. The ONS said that ""more needs to be done to address the gender gap in unpaid work"". The ONS data also showed that the amount of time people spend on paid and unpaid work has increased in recent decades. In 1995, people spent an average of 37 hours a week on paid and unpaid work. By 2015, this had increased to 42 hours a week. The ONS said that the increase in working hours was partly due to the fact that more women are now in the workforce. However, the ONS also said that ""the increasing demands of work and family life"" may be playing a role.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Ex-soldier self-isolating on 'uninhabited' Hildasay,"Chris Lewis has walked 12,000 miles after setting off from near his home in Swansea in August 2017. He has now been self-isolating on the remote Scottish island of Hildasay since March 23. The island, which is located in the North Atlantic, is home to only one other person, a farmer who lives on the neighboring island of Sanday. Lewis, a former soldier, decided to self-isolate on Hildasay after the UK government imposed a lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said he wanted to ""get away from the crowds"" and ""minimize the risk"" of contracting the virus. ""I'm not afraid of the virus,"" Lewis told the BBC. ""I'm just being sensible. I don't want to put anyone else at risk."" Lewis has been living in a bothy, a small stone hut, on Hildasay. He has been foraging for food and fishing for mackerel. He has also been keeping a blog about his experience. ""I'm really enjoying it,"" Lewis said. ""It's a beautiful island and I'm getting plenty of exercise. I'm also learning a lot about survival skills."" Lewis is not the only person who has chosen to self-isolate on a remote island during the pandemic. In April, a group of six people from the UK sailed to the uninhabited island of Gigha in the Inner Hebrides. The group, which included a doctor, a nurse, and a teacher, said they wanted to ""create a safe haven"" away from the virus. ""We're not trying to escape reality,"" one of the group members told the BBC. ""We just want to live a more sustainable and self-sufficient life."" The decision to self-isolate on a remote island is not without its risks. The islands are often exposed to harsh weather conditions and there is limited access to medical care. However, for some people, the benefits of escaping the crowds and living a simpler life outweigh the risks. ""I'm not sure how long I'll stay on Hildasay,"" Lewis said. ""But I'm in no rush to leave.

Putin's Stasi spy ID pass found in Germany,"The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass, a document that allowed him to access restricted areas in East Germany, was recently discovered in the archives of the German secret service. The pass, which bears Putin's photo and signature, was issued in 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is a reminder of Putin's close ties to the former East German regime, which was one of the Soviet Union's closest allies. Putin has never denied his past as a KGB officer, and he has often spoken fondly of his time in Dresden. In a 2014 interview, he said that he ""learned a lot"" from his experience in East Germany, and that it helped him to ""understand the world."" However, some critics have accused Putin of glorifying the Soviet Union and its repressive regime. They argue that his nostalgia for the past is a sign that he is not committed to democratic values. The discovery of Putin's Stasi pass is likely to fuel further debate about his past. It is a reminder of his close ties to the former East German regime, and it raises questions about his commitment to democratic values. In addition to the pass, the German secret service also discovered a number of other documents related to Putin's time in Dresden. These documents include reports on his activities, as well as assessments of his character. The documents provide a glimpse into Putin's life as a young KGB officer. They show that he was a ambitious and dedicated agent, who was highly valued by his superiors. The documents also reveal that Putin was involved in a number of controversial activities while in Dresden. These activities include the surveillance of dissidents and the suppression of political dissent. The discovery of Putin's Stasi pass and the related documents is a significant event. It provides new information about his past, and it raises important questions about his commitment to democratic values.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Trump tariffs: President says EU makes business 'impossible',"Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had ""taken advantage of"" the US for many years. He said the EU was ""very difficult to deal with"" and made it ""impossible"" for US businesses to make money. ""We can't have that, we're not going to have that,"" he said. The EU has said it will retaliate against the US tariffs, which it believes violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The US has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, and is threatening to impose tariffs on cars and other products. The EU has said it will impose tariffs on a range of US products, including motorcycles, bourbon and jeans. The trade dispute is the latest in a series of tensions between the US and the EU. The two sides have also been at odds over Iran, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The US has also imposed tariffs on China, and is threatening to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods, and the two sides are currently engaged in trade talks. The trade disputes are having a negative impact on the global economy, and are raising fears of a trade war. The WTO has warned that the trade disputes could lead to a global recession. The US and the EU are the world's two largest economies, and a trade war between the two would have a significant impact on the global economy. The trade disputes are also raising tensions between the US and its allies. The EU and China are both allies of the US, and the trade disputes are putting a strain on those relationships. The US is also at odds with Canada and Mexico over trade, and is threatening to impose tariffs on imports from those countries. The trade disputes are a major challenge for the Trump administration, and it is unclear how they will be resolved. The Trump administration has said that it is willing to negotiate with other countries, but it is also prepared to impose tariffs if necessary. The trade disputes are a complex and difficult issue, and it is unclear how they will be resolved.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sir Terry Matthews: Wales lacks IT commerce skills,"The industrialist, who made his fortune in hi-tech firms, is to address a conference in Newport on how businesses can use IT to boost profits. He said: ""We don't lack people who can write an algorithm, or design a software programme, or get a computer system up and running. What we lack, and this is across all industries, is people who really understand how to transform businesses by using IT."" Sir Terry believes the Welsh government is taking important steps to improve the situation, but more is needed from industry itself. ""The Welsh government has a role, through schools and training, to make sure people get the basic skills they need,"" he said. ""But really, we need more people to become IT-savvy middle managers. Businesses need to create more jobs specifically in this area."" He said companies need to move away from the ""traditional mindset"" of seeing IT as a ""geeky backroom function"". He said: ""It's not that. IT is a powerful tool that can help businesses reach new customers, increase efficiency, improve productivity, and make better decisions."" Sir Terry said the conference will hear practical advice from business leaders who have successfully used IT to boost their profits, including examples from industries as diverse as manufacturing, tourism and retail. ""I hope a lot of business people from all over Wales will come along,"" he said. ""The conference will leave them in no doubt that IT can be a big help to businesses of all sizes."" The conference, called ""IT for Business Growth"", will be held at the Newport Hilton on 10 May. Further information can be found at www.itforbusinessgrowth.com. Sir Terry Matthews is a Welsh entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is the founder and former chairman of several successful hi-tech firms, including Mitel, Newbridge Networks and Dialog Semiconductor.

Rory Cowan: 'Unhappy' Mrs Brown's Boys actor quits,"Cowan said he had been ""unhappy"", and left his co-stars after a Mrs Brown show at London's O2 Arena on Sunday. He has worked with the comedy's creator Brendan O'Carroll for 26 years. ""It was a hard decision to leave after 26 years,"" Cowan told PA Media. ""It was a great job but I'm not happy doing it anymore."" Cowan played Rory Brown in the sitcom, which has been a huge hit for the BBC since it began in 2011. The show has won numerous awards, including two BAFTAs. However, Cowan said he had become increasingly unhappy with the show in recent years. ""I've been unhappy for a long time,"" he said. ""I've been talking to Brendan about it for the last few years. I've been trying to work it out, but I couldn't do it anymore."" Cowan said he did not want to go into detail about his reasons for leaving, but he said it was not because of any disagreement with O'Carroll. ""I've had a great time working with Brendan,"" he said. ""He's a great guy and I wish him all the best."" O'Carroll said he was ""very sad"" to see Cowan leave the show. ""Rory is a great actor and a great friend,"" he said. ""I wish him all the best in the future."" Cowan's departure is the latest in a series of changes for Mrs Brown's Boys. In 2020, Brendan O'Carroll's wife Jenny Gibney left the show after 20 years. However, O'Carroll has said that the show will continue despite the departures. ""The show will go on,"" he said. ""We've got a great cast and crew and we're still getting great ratings."" Mrs Brown's Boys has been criticized for its perceived homophobia and transphobia. In 2020, the show was accused of using homophobic slurs in an episode. However, O'Carroll has defended the show, saying that it is not intended to be offensive. ""I'm not a homophobe,"" he said. ""I'm not a transphobe.

John Boehner survives House rebellion in US Congress,"Mr Boehner survived a challenge from the party's more conservative wing, with 25 Republicans voting against him. At the top of the Republican agenda is approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial project that would carry oil from Canada to the US Gulf Coast. The pipeline is opposed by environmentalists, who argue that it would increase carbon emissions and contribute to climate change. However, Republicans argue that the pipeline would create jobs and boost the economy. Boehner's victory is a sign that he has been able to maintain the support of the majority of his caucus, despite the challenge from the more conservative wing of the party. However, the vote also shows that there is significant opposition to his leadership within the Republican Party. This opposition could make it difficult for Boehner to pass legislation in the future, especially if he needs the support of conservative Republicans. The vote on the Keystone XL pipeline is likely to be a major test for Boehner's leadership. If he is unable to pass the bill, it will be a sign that he is losing the support of his caucus. However, if he is able to pass the bill, it will be a major victory for him and for the Republican Party. The Keystone XL pipeline is a major infrastructure project that would have a significant impact on the US economy and environment. The pipeline would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States, and it is estimated to create thousands of jobs and add billions of dollars to the US economy. However, the pipeline is also opposed by environmentalists, who argue that it would increase carbon emissions and contribute to climate change.

Mayor hopes Treasury will hop on board travel plans,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter Today the mayor is in Northern Ireland showing off the new chassis production line for the 'New Bus for London', a modern design based on the old Routemaster which has been built at Wrightbus in Ballymena for 70 years. It will be a hybrid diesel-electric double-decker with more wheelchair spaces and USB charging points and, crucially, the ability to convert to 100% electric when the technology allows. At the same time, Transport for London (TfL) has begun its own consultation on proposals for a new bus franchising system in the capital. Under the plans, all buses would be run by a small number of companies under contract to TfL, rather than the current system where each operator is responsible for its own routes. The mayor hopes the Treasury will hop on board his travel plans by providing funding for a pilot scheme and, crucially, for the conversion to electric buses. The government's Integrated Rail Plan for the north of England, published last week, has been criticised for ignoring Leeds and Bradford and the potential to develop the Northern Powerhouse. There is a glimmer of hope for West Yorkshire, however, with the promise of £200m towards a new mass transit system that will link Leeds Bradford Airport with the city centres of Leeds and Bradford. In his speech, the mayor will also unveil plans for a new walking and cycling superhighway between Barking Riverside in east London and the City of London. The 12-mile route, which will be open 24 hours a day, will be mostly segregated from traffic and is intended to make it easier and safer for people to travel between east and central London. The mayor is also expected to announce a new push to make London the most cycle-friendly city in the world. The plans include a new 'Cycle Superhub' at Waterloo station, which will provide secure parking for 10,000 bikes, and a new 'Cycleway to Heaven' that will link the North Circular with Alexandra Palace. The mayor's plans are ambitious, but they are also essential if London is to meet its goals of reducing air pollution and congestion. With the government's support, he can make London a more sustainable and livable city for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, 'not caused by the XMRV virus', say researchers","By Helen Briggs Health reporter, BBC News US scientists linked the condition, also known as ME, to a mouse-like virus in 2009 after finding it in a few patients. The finding raised hopes that a cause had been found and even that a cure might be on the horizon. But subsequent research has cast doubt on this idea, with other scientists failing to find the virus in ME patients. Now a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences provides the strongest evidence yet that the virus is not a cause of ME. The study tested nearly 1,000 people - about half with ME, and half healthy - for the presence of XMRV. They found that, out of about 500 people with ME, 6.7% had antibodies to the virus. But, out of about 500 healthy controls, 6.5% also had antibodies to the virus. This suggests that the presence of the virus is not what distinguishes people with ME from healthy people. The researchers also looked for the actual virus in the blood of people with ME and in healthy controls, again finding no difference between the groups. They also looked for signs of an active viral infection in people with ME and did not find any. This all adds to the growing body of evidence that XMRV is not a cause of ME. At the very least, the virus is not necessary for the development of ME, and it is unlikely to be sufficient to cause the condition. The researchers say that this does not mean that a virus is not involved in ME. It could be that another virus, so far undetected, is the cause. Or it could be that a virus is a trigger for ME in some people, but that other factors are also required. The researchers say that more research is needed to find the cause of ME. In the meantime, they say that people with ME should not be discouraged by the latest findings. There is still hope that a cause will be found and that a cure will be developed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Netflix removes Dave Chappelle's show after comedian's complaint,"Chappelle's Show first aired on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2006. But in an excerpt from a recent stand-up gig that he posted on Instagram, he claimed he ""never got paid"" royalties. ""They didn't have to pay me because I signed a contract,"" he says in the clip. ""But is that right? I found out that these people were streaming my work, and they never paid me a dime..."" Netflix confirmed to the BBC that it had removed the show from its platform. ""We licensed Chappelle's Show from ViacomCBS, and we're removing the show from Netflix until we can resolve the licensing issues,"" a spokesperson said. ViacomCBS, which owns Comedy Central, said in a statement that it ""has been actively working with Netflix to resolve this issue"". The move has sparked a debate about the rights of artists and performers, particularly in the streaming era. Some have argued that Chappelle is right to demand payment for his work, while others have questioned whether he has the legal right to do so. In a statement posted on his website, Chappelle said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by Netflix's decision to remove the show. He said he had ""no idea"" that Netflix was not paying him royalties and that he had asked his lawyers to ""look into this and find out what happened"". The comedian also said that he was ""not going to go into a lot of detail"" about the matter, but he wanted to make it clear that he ""will not tolerate"" being ""taken advantage of"". ""I hope that we can come to a resolution soon,"" he said. ""But if we don't, I will take whatever legal action is necessary to protect my rights."" The dispute highlights the complex legal landscape around streaming rights. In the past, artists and performers have often signed contracts that give streaming services the right to distribute their work without paying them royalties. However, there is a growing movement to challenge these contracts and to ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their work. It is unclear how the Chappelle's Show dispute will be resolved. However, it is likely to have a significant impact on the way that streaming services negotiate with artists and performers in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Le Patourel brothers could be set for Guernsey blue plaque honour,"Plans to place the plaque at their former home in the Fosse Andre, in St Peter Port, have been submitted. John Herbert Le Patourel was a leader in the fight to have capital punishment abolished in the British Isles. He was also a campaigner for the rights of homosexuals and for animal welfare. His brother, Clement Le Patourel, was a painter and photographer who was also active in the campaign against capital punishment. The plaque will commemorate the brothers' contribution to social justice. It will also serve as a reminder of the importance of fighting for what you believe in. The Le Patourel brothers were born in Guernsey in the 19th century. John Herbert was born in 1863 and Clement in 1864. The brothers were raised in a religious family and were educated at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. John Herbert Le Patourel studied law at Cambridge University and was called to the bar in 1888. He returned to Guernsey and practiced law until 1905, when he was elected to the States of Guernsey. He served as a member of the States until 1945. During his time in the States, John Herbert Le Patourel was a vocal opponent of capital punishment. He introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment in Guernsey in 1906, but it was defeated. He continued to campaign against capital punishment and in 1943 he succeeded in having it abolished in Guernsey. John Herbert Le Patourel was also a campaigner for the rights of homosexuals. He was one of the founders of the Homosexual Law Reform Society in 1958. He also worked with the Albany Trust, which provided support to homosexuals who had been convicted of crimes.

Covid: Device aids 'virtual' treatment of Leicester patients,"Patients take their own blood oxygen readings using the small device, which is linked to a smartphone app that sends the data to clinical staff. The monitor, known as a pulse oximeter, measures the level of oxygen saturation in the blood, which can drop to dangerously low levels in Covid-19 patients. The data can then be reviewed by healthcare professionals at the trust's Covid Oximetry@Home service, who can provide advice and support remotely. In some cases, the service has been able to prevent patients from needing to be admitted to hospital. Dr Andy Carson, a consultant respiratory physician at University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, said: ""Covid Oximetry@Home has been a real success story. ""It has meant that patients can be monitored and treated in the comfort of their own homes, while also freeing up hospital beds for those who need them most. ""The pulse oximeters are small and easy to use, and the app is very user-friendly. ""Patients have really appreciated being able to take an active role in their own care, and it has given them peace of mind to know that they are being monitored remotely by healthcare professionals."" One patient who has benefited from the service is 70-year-old John Smith. Mr Smith, who has underlying health conditions, tested positive for Covid-19 in January. He was initially treated at home by his GP, but his condition deteriorated and he was referred to the Covid Oximetry@Home service. Mr Smith said: ""The service was fantastic.

Monarch airline awaits package holiday licence decision,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch's licence by 24 hours on Saturday amid uncertainty about the company's future. However, with the deadline now passed, the regulator has yet to comment on whether the airline will be granted a package holiday licence. Monarch, which was founded in 1967, is the UK's fifth largest airline. It operates scheduled and charter flights to destinations in Europe and North Africa. The company has been struggling financially in recent months, and was forced to cancel flights earlier this year. The CAA has said that it will not grant Monarch a licence if it is not satisfied that the airline is financially sound. The regulator is also concerned about Monarch's plans to reduce its fleet and staff. Monarch has said that it is confident that it will be granted a licence. The airline has said that it has a strong business plan and that it is committed to providing a quality service to its customers. However, industry experts have expressed doubts about Monarch's future. They say that the airline is facing a number of challenges, including competition from low-cost airlines and the rising cost of fuel. If Monarch is not granted a licence, it will be forced to cease trading. This would mean that thousands of passengers would be left stranded and would have to find alternative flights. The CAA is expected to make a decision on Monarch's licence in the coming days. In the meantime, the airline is continuing to operate its flights as normal. Update: The CAA has announced that it has refused to grant Monarch a package holiday licence. This means that the airline will be forced to cease trading. Monarch has said that it is ""deeply disappointed"" by the CAA's decision. The airline has said that it will now enter into administration. The CAA has said that it is working to ensure that Monarch passengers are not left stranded.

'Tuition grants affecting Welsh universities',"Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant. Ministers are set to announce a major review of student funding in Wales. Prof Riordan wants the Welsh government to bring in a system of student grants that would replace the current system of tuition fee loans. Under the existing scheme, the poorest students pay nothing towards their tuition fees, while the majority pay £9,250 a year towards their degree. This money is paid back through the tax system once graduates are earning more than £27,295 a year. But critics of the current system argue that it is unfair on students from poorer backgrounds, who often end up with large debts. They also say it has contributed to the widening gap between rich and poor. Prof Riordan said the current system was ""not sustainable"" and needed to be replaced with a ""fairer"" system. ""We need to move to a system of grants that are means tested,"" he said. ""This would mean that students from poorer backgrounds would get more support, while those from wealthier backgrounds would pay more."" He said this would help to ""level the playing field"" and ensure that all students had an equal chance of success. ""We want to create a system that is fair and equitable for all students,"" he said. ""We believe that a means tested grant system is the best way to do this."" The Welsh government said it was ""committed to ensuring that higher education is affordable and accessible to all"". ""We are currently undertaking a major review of student funding in Wales and will be announcing our findings in due course,"" a spokesman said. The review is expected to look at a range of options, including a means tested grant system.

""We have just had one of the busiest Januarys on record in terms of ambulance arrivals and in A&E,"" he said. ""This means long waits in A&E for patients - and for ambulances waiting to hand over patients.

Celebrities join calls to axe sixth-form 'learning tax',"Unlike schools and academies, sixth-form colleges in England are unable to claim back their VAT costs. The government says they are liable for VAT because they are classified as ""commercial organisations"". This means that sixth-form colleges have to charge VAT on their fees, which can add up to thousands of pounds for each student. The government has been urged to scrap the VAT charge on sixth-form education, with critics arguing that it is a ""stealth tax"" on further education. A number of celebrities have now joined the calls to axe the VAT charge, including actor and comedian David Walliams, singer Paloma Faith and TV presenter Davina McCall. In a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, they said: ""VAT on sixth-form education is a barrier to learning and opportunity for young people. ""It is a stealth tax on further education that is unfair and unjust. We urge you to scrap it."" The government has said that it is ""committed to supporting further education"" and that it will ""continue to look at ways to make the system fairer"". However, it has not yet committed to scrapping the VAT charge on sixth-form education. The Association of Colleges (AoC) has welcomed the support of celebrities for their campaign to axe the VAT charge. AoC chief executive David Hughes said: ""We are grateful to these celebrities for using their voices to highlight the unfairness of VAT on sixth-form education. ""This is a tax that is holding back young people and preventing them from reaching their full potential."" The AoC is calling on the government to scrap the VAT charge on sixth-form education as a matter of urgency. Mr Hughes said: ""We believe that every young person should have the opportunity to access high-quality further education, regardless of their background or financial circumstances. ""Scrapping the VAT charge would be a major step towards making this a reality.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

He added: ""I think we can get it by the middle of the week but we need to see commitment from all sides."" The UK government has said it is ""committed to finding a solution"" that works for all. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said: ""We have been working hard to find a way forward that addresses the concerns raised by Sinn Féin. ""We are committed to finding a solution that works for all of Northern Ireland and we will continue to work with all parties to achieve that."" The welfare reform bill is part of a wider package of reforms to the welfare system in the UK. The bill includes a number of changes, such as reducing the amount of money that people can claim in benefits and introducing a new Universal Credit system. Sinn Féin has said that it cannot support the bill because it believes it will disproportionately affect the poorest in society. The party has also said that the bill is not in line with the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is the peace agreement that was signed in 1998. The agreement brought an end to the Troubles, a period of violence in Northern Ireland that lasted for over 30 years. The Good Friday Agreement includes a number of provisions that are designed to protect the rights of all communities in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin has said that the welfare reform bill breaches these provisions. The UK government has said that it is committed to the Good Friday Agreement. However, the government has also said that it believes that the welfare reform bill is necessary to reduce the deficit. The talks between Sinn Féin and the UK government are ongoing. It is hoped that a deal can be reached that will allow the welfare reform bill to be passed while also protecting the rights of all communities in Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

He said the government needed to make an ""active decision"" on whether the risk of fraud outweighed the benefits of increased accessibility. ""I think they have an obligation to make us confident that the systems they are proposing will be safe and secure,"" he added. The government is currently consulting on plans for online voting in some elections in England. It says it will ""not introduce digital-only voting unless and until we are fully satisfied that it is secure"". But Sir John said he was ""not yet persuaded"" that the government had done enough to ensure the security of e-voting systems. ""There is still a lot of work to be done,"" he said. ""I think the government needs to be very careful about this. This is not something that can be rushed. It needs to be done properly."" The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for more accessible voting, said e-voting could make it easier for people to participate in elections. ""We know that electronic voting can be secure if it is done properly,"" said the society's chief executive, Darren Hughes. ""It is important to remember that there are many different types of electronic voting systems, and not all of them are created equal. ""The government needs to ensure that any system it introduces is robust and secure."" Mr Hughes said the government should also consider the accessibility benefits of e-voting. ""For many people, electronic voting could make it easier to cast their ballot,"" he said. ""This could be particularly important for people with disabilities, people who work long hours, or people who live in remote areas."" The government has said it will not introduce e-voting unless it is confident that it is secure and accessible.

Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors,"Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors By Louise Cullen BBC NI News Green Pastures church plans to build an urban village on the edge of Ballymena, with housing, business parks, a hotel and community facilities. Planners recommended the multi-million pound proposal should be rejected, but elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council's planning committee voted five to three in favour. The development will include 430 homes, a business park, hotel, medical centre and shops. The site at Cushendall Road is just outside the town and Green Pastures is also planning to build a church and community facilities there. The church initially proposed 700 homes on the 64-acre site, which had been opposed by some residents due to traffic concerns, but that was reduced to 430. DUP Alderman William McCaughey said the development was ""in the wrong location"". ""We don't want to see green fields and open space sacrificed for profit. That is not what we should be doing and it's not what the constituents who put us here want to see, either,"" he said. However, Sinn Féin councillor Ryan McMullan proposed the application be approved. ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Ballymena and our borough,"" he said. The development has been welcomed by Ballymena's business community. ""This is a very significant development for the town and one which will deliver hundreds of jobs,"" said Ballymena Chamber of Commerce and Industry president John Hood. ""It will create 430 new homes which will help address the current housing shortage in the area."" Mrs Cullen added that the Green Pastures church's application was one of several major housing developments currently at the planning stage in Ballymena. In total, almost 2,000 new homes are expected to be built in the town in the coming years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ariana Grande says she feels 'broken' after Manchester concert attack,"The US star was not physically hurt, but posted a tweet saying: ""Broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."" The blast happened just after the 23-year-old singer had finished performing. It is the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Speaking a few hours after the explosion, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""Tonight we have seen the worst of humanity. But I've also seen the best of humanity."" He said people had risked their own lives to help others, describing an off-duty nurse who had saved a child's life. Prime Minister Theresa May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Tuesday morning and praised the ""extraordinary bravery"" of the emergency services. ""This was an act of appalling barbarism,"" she said ""The people who did this want to divide us, but we will never let them succeed."" The Queen said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the attack. ""The whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night,"" she said. ""This was a particularly cruel attack, which targeted young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives."" The attack is being investigated by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit. Police have arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the bombing. The force said he was arrested at 12:30 BST and remains in police custody. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. However, many experts believe the attack bears the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. The group has claimed responsibility for previous attacks on civilians in Europe, including the November 2015 Paris attacks and the March 2016 Brussels bombings. The US State Department has issued a travel warning for the UK, urging US citizens to be aware of the ""increased threat of terrorism"". The warning said that ""terrorists may be planning attacks targeting tourist sites, transportation hubs, and other public areas in the UK"". US President Donald Trump has offered his condolences to the victims of the attack.

Why good economics can make for bad politics,"Why Good Economics Can Make for Bad Politics India's beleaguered Congress-led ruling coalition in Delhi is discovering that, in its attempts to push through major economic reforms, it may have been inadvertently opening itself up to political backlash. On Tuesday evening, its unpredictable ally the Trinamool Congress pulled out of the ruling United Progressive Alliance coalition, destabilizing the government and raising questions about the future direction of India's economic policy. At the heart of the matter is a sharp divide between the government's technocratic approach to economic reform and the political realities of India's complex and fractious politics. For example, the government's recent relaxation of foreign investment rules in a bid to attract capital and boost growth has been met with staunch opposition from several of its coalition partners. These parties fear that such measures will lead to job losses and the erosion of indigenous industries. This clash between good economics and bad politics is not unique to India. In fact, it is a recurring theme in many developing countries, where governments often face the difficult choice of implementing unpopular but necessary economic policies or appeasing their political base. In the case of India, the government's focus on austerity and fiscal consolidation has drawn criticism from the Left, which argues that it is hurting the poor and marginalized. Similarly, the government's efforts to reform the labor market, which include making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers, have sparked protests from unions and opposition parties. This tension between economic reform and political expediency is often referred to as the ""political economy"" problem. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that has stymied policymakers around the world. In India, the political economy problem is compounded by a lack of consensus on what constitutes ""good economics."" Different political parties and interest groups have competing visions for the country's economic development, making it difficult to forge a cohesive policy agenda. Moreover, the government's credibility has been eroded by a series of corruption scandals, making it even harder to convince the public of the need for austerity and reform. As the Indian government continues to grapple with the political economy problem, it will need to find a way to balance the demands of good economics with the realities of bad politics. This is no easy task, but it is essential for the country's long-term economic well-being.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Germany migrant shelter fire 'cheered by onlookers',"The fire in the town of Bautzen in the early hours of Sunday morning destroyed the roof of a former hotel that was being used to house 101 refugees, mostly Syrians and Iraqis. No one was injured in the blaze but police are treating it as arson.  Saxony, where Bautzen is located, has been at the forefront of resistance to Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy. The state has borne the brunt of the new arrivals, taking in 45,000 refugees last year - about 10% of the national total. Recent weeks have seen a series of attacks on refugee shelters in the eastern state. Local officials said three suspects were seen fleeing the scene and that witnesses had reported hearing people celebrating as the shelter burned. ""It is a miracle that no one was killed,"" said Saxony's interior minister Markus Ulbig. ""This was an act of inhumanity."" The fire comes just days after another refugee shelter was attacked in the town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony. In that case, a group of far-right protesters prevented asylum seekers from entering the shelter, chanting xenophobic slogans. The attacks have prompted widespread condemnation from politicians and community leaders. ""This is a dark day for Germany,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""These attacks are an attack on our values ​​and our humanity."" The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the attacks were reminiscent of the Nazi era. ""We must never forget that anti-Semitism and xenophobia go hand in hand,"" he said. The attacks have also raised concerns about the growing influence of far-right groups in Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has campaigned against immigration and Islam, has made significant gains in recent elections. Some critics have accused the AfD of stoking anti-immigrant sentiment and creating a climate of fear and intimidation. The AfD has denied these accusations, blaming the attacks on a small number of extremists. However, the party's rhetoric has been welcomed by some far-right groups, who see it as giving legitimacy to their views. The attacks on refugee shelters have sent shockwaves through Germany and raised serious questions about the country's ability to integrate newcomers. The government has vowed to crack down on those responsible for the attacks and to protect refugees from further harm. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to stem the tide of xenophobia and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wild animals circus ban passes first Holyrood vote,"MSPs unanimously signed off the general principles of the ban, which would be the first of its kind in the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said using animals in this manner was ""morally objectionable"". MSPs raised a series of concerns over the impact of the ban, including the livelihoods of circus performers and animal welfare during transportation. Opposition parties broadly supported the legislation, but raised questions about the timing of the ban and whether it provided enough support for the industry to adapt. Scottish Labour said it was ""disappointed"" the government had not provided more detail on a financial support package for circuses. The party's environment spokesperson, Claudia Beamish, said: ""Scottish Labour supports the principle of banning the use of wild animals in circuses, but we have concerns about the timing of the bill. ""We want to make sure that the right support is in place to assist circuses in transitioning to animal-free shows."" The Scottish Conservatives also raised questions about the potential impact on jobs. Rural affairs spokesman Finlay Carson said: ""The ban will put 50 jobs at risk and it is going to make it very difficult for small circuses which use wild animals to operate."" He called on the government to provide a ""proper financial support package"" for affected businesses. The Scottish Greens welcomed the legislation, saying it was a ""landmark moment"" for animal welfare. Environment spokesperson Mark Ruskell said: ""This ban is a victory for animal welfare and a reflection of changing public attitudes. ""We have campaigned for this ban for many years and we are delighted that the Scottish Parliament has taken this historic step."" The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) also welcomed the vote, saying it was a ""great day for animals"". Chief executive Kirsteen Campbell said: ""This is a landmark decision that will spare countless animals from a life of suffering. ""We have long campaigned for a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses and we are delighted that the Scottish Parliament has listened to our concerns."" The legislation will now be subject to further scrutiny by MSPs before it can be passed into law.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Essex County Council HQ swastikas should be removed says UKIP group,"Earlier this week, it was reported the markings on County Hall had been deemed ""potentially upsetting"". The carvings on Chelmsford's County Hall, built between 1928 and 1939, were made by a local stonemason and are believed to be based on ancient Hindu symbols of good luck. However, the swastika was later adopted by the Nazi party in Germany and has since become associated with fascism and racism. As a result, some people have called for the carvings to be removed from the building. In a statement, UKIP group leader John Vasey said: ""These carvings are a reminder of a dark period in our history and have no place on a public building. They should be removed as soon as possible."" Vasey said the carvings were ""offensive"" and ""upsetting"" to many people. ""They need to go,"" he said. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns that have been raised about the carvings on County Hall. We are currently reviewing the situation and will be taking into account all of the views that have been expressed. ""We understand that the swastika is a symbol that can cause offence and we want to be sensitive to the concerns of all our residents."" The spokesperson said the council would be making a decision on the future of the carvings ""in due course"". The swastika is an ancient symbol that has been used by many cultures around the world. However, its association with the Nazi party in Germany has led to it being widely regarded as a symbol of hate and intolerance. In recent years, there have been a number of calls for the removal of swastikas from public buildings and other places. In 2018, the London Borough of Camden voted to remove a swastika from the facade of a building in Hampstead. The decision to remove the swastikas from County Hall will ultimately be up to Essex County Council. The council will need to weigh the concerns of those who find the carvings offensive against the historical and architectural significance of the building.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Leeds war hero's statue could be moved to heritage centre,"Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron, from Leeds, was killed on a bombing mission in Italy. The RAF pilot was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honour, for his bravery in continuing to fly his stricken plane so his crew could bail out. His statue currently stands in Leeds city centre, but a campaign has been launched to move it to the Royal Armouries Museum's new £25m visitor centre. The museum is dedicated to telling the story of the British Army and is already home to a number of war memorials and artefacts. Supporters of the move say the statue would be more fittingly displayed in a place that tells the story of the armed forces and would be seen by more people. However, others have argued that the statue should remain in the city centre as a reminder of Leeds's proud military history. The decision on whether to move the statue will be made by Leeds City Council. A council spokesman said: ""We are aware of the campaign to move the statue of Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron to the Royal Armouries Museum. ""We will be considering all options and consulting with stakeholders before making a decision."" In a statement, the Royal Armouries Museum said: ""We are honoured to have been approached to house the statue of Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron. ""We believe that the museum would be a fitting home for the statue and that it would be seen by more people here than in its current location. ""We are committed to working with Leeds City Council and other stakeholders to ensure that the statue is displayed in a way that is respectful and appropriate."" Flt Sgt Aaron was born in Leeds in 1914. He joined the RAF in 1940 and flew with 105 Squadron. On 12 August 1942, he was piloting a Lancaster bomber on a bombing mission to Turin in Italy. His plane was hit by enemy fire and badly damaged. Despite being wounded himself, Flt Sgt Aaron continued to fly the plane so his crew could bail out. He was eventually forced to abandon the plane himself but was killed when his parachute failed to open. Flt Sgt Aaron was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery. The citation for his award reads: ""For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the face of the enemy. ""Flight Sergeant Aaron pressed home his attack with the utmost determination, in spite of heavy opposition, until his aircraft was set on fire.

Hong Kong student's death sparks impromptu protests and vigils,"Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation to clear the area on Monday morning. The exact circumstances of his fall are unclear, but reports say he was trying to get away from police who had been firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Chow's death has sparked impromptu protests and vigils across Hong Kong. On Monday evening, thousands of people gathered at the site of his death to mourn and demand answers. They held candles and sang songs, and some chanted slogans against the police and government. The protests continued on Tuesday, with demonstrators gathering in several districts of Hong Kong. They blocked roads, set up barricades, and clashed with police. The police responded with tear gas and water cannons, and several people were arrested. Chow's death has reignited anger and frustration among many Hong Kong people, who feel that the government is not listening to their demands for greater democracy and autonomy. The protests are likely to continue in the coming days and weeks, and could escalate if the government does not respond to the demands of the demonstrators. The death of Alex Chow has also raised questions about the use of force by the police. Some witnesses have accused the police of using excessive force against the protesters, and there have been calls for an independent investigation into Chow's death. The police have defended their use of force, saying that it was necessary to maintain order and protect public safety. However, the Independent Police Complaints Council, which investigates complaints against the police, has announced that it will launch an investigation into Chow's death. The death of Alex Chow is a tragedy, and it is important that the circumstances surrounding his death are fully investigated. It is also important that the government listens to the demands of the protesters and addresses their concerns about democracy and autonomy. If the government does not respond to the demands of the protesters, the protests are likely to continue and could escalate.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""We feel so let down by the Gambling Commission,"" he said. ""They knew about the problems with VIP schemes but they did nothing. They've allowed these companies to continue operating and people are dying because of it. ""Chris was a vulnerable young man who should never have been given VIP status. He had a history of mental health problems and he was struggling with addiction. ""PT Entertainment should have known that he was not in a position to gamble. But they didn't care.

A spokesperson for PT Entertainment said the company was ""committed to responsible gambling"" and that it was ""co-operating fully with the GC's investigation"". Chris's death has highlighted the dangers of VIP gambling schemes, which have been linked to a number of other problem gambling cases. VIP schemes are designed to attract high-spending customers by offering them a range of perks, such as free bets, bonuses and access to exclusive events. However, there is concern that these schemes can encourage people to gamble more than they can afford, and that they can lead to addiction. The GC has introduced a number of measures to try to reduce the risks associated with VIP gambling schemes, including a new affordability check requirement. However, critics argue that these measures do not go far enough, and that the GC needs to do more to protect people from the dangers of gambling.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
US 'preparing indictment against Julian Assange' of WikiLeaks,"The reports came as a filing in a separate court case hinted that charges were being prepared. Justice officials said the filing was made in error. Mr. Assange fled to Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations. He has always denied the allegations. In 2017, Sweden dropped its investigation into the sexual assault allegations, but Mr. Assange remained in the embassy, fearing that if he left, he would be extradited to the United States to face charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of classified US documents. In April 2019, Mr. Assange was arrested by UK police after Ecuador withdrew its asylum protection. He was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for breaching his bail conditions. In May 2019, the US Justice Department announced that it had charged Mr. Assange with conspiracy to hack into a US government computer system. The indictment alleges that Mr. Assange conspired with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain and publish classified US documents. Mr. Assange's lawyers have argued that the charges against him are politically motivated and that he is being persecuted for his work as a journalist. They have also said that the indictment is an attempt by the US government to set a precedent for prosecuting other journalists who publish classified information. The US government has said that the charges against Mr. Assange are not related to his work as a journalist, but rather to his alleged criminal activity. The government has also said that it is committed to protecting freedom of the press. The case against Mr. Assange is expected to go to trial in 2023.

But in a consultation on whether to change it, more than half of the 30,000 respondents thought the wording should be altered to reflect the diversity of members and modern society. The changes would affect more than 300,000 Guides, aged four to 14, across the UK. The organization has published a report on the consultation, which it says shows a ""clear desire"" for change. The three main suggestions are: Removing references to God, Queen, and country Replacing the phrase ""to help other people"" with ""to serve my community"" Adding a promise to ""be inclusive"" The Girlguiding chief executive, Angela Salt, said: ""Our current promise was written in 1930 and has stood the test of time, but language evolves and society changes, and we want to ensure that our promise remains relevant and meaningful to our members today."" She added that the changes would ""make it clearer that Guiding is for everyone, regardless of their beliefs, background or circumstances."" The consultation, which ran from October to December 2022, was the biggest ever undertaken by Girlguiding. Some of those who responded felt that the current wording was too narrow and prescriptive. ""I am a British citizen with a Hindu faith,"" said one. ""The promise as it is now is alienating and exclusive for me and my daughter."" Others said that the changes would dilute the organization's unique identity. ""We are a Christian organization and our promise should reflect that,"" wrote one Guide.

""However, we are not immune to the wider economic pressures, and the outlook for the rest of the year is uncertain."" The BRC said that consumer confidence remains low, and that retailers are facing rising costs for energy, wages, and transportation.

Paul Cleeland: ‘Non-disclosure’ claim over 1972 murder,"Paul Cleeland: ‘Non-disclosure’ claim over 1972 murder By Tanya Gupta BBC News Paul Cleeland has made a fresh request to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to revisit his case. He served 26 years for the murder of Terry Clark, who was found dead in a derelict building in Rotherham in 1972. Mr Cleeland, now 70, has always maintained his innocence. He was released on licence in 1999, and his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2006 after it found vital evidence had not been disclosed to his defence team at the time of his trial. In 2012, an independent review of Mr Cleeland's case found there had been ""a serious miscarriage of justice"" and described the police investigation as ""woefully inadequate"". It also found that officers had put ""improper pressure"" on witnesses. However, the CCRC refused to refer Mr Cleeland's case back to the Court of Appeal, saying it was not satisfied that the conviction was unsafe. Mr Cleeland has now submitted a fresh application to the CCRC, arguing that new evidence has come to light which shows that the police failed to disclose a number of key documents to his defence team. The documents include: A statement from a witness who saw Mr Cleeland leaving the scene of the murder with another man. A report from a forensic scientist which concluded that the blood found on Mr Cleeland's clothing did not match the victim's blood. A transcript of a telephone conversation between a police officer and a witness which suggests that the police were aware of Mr Cleeland's innocence. Mr Cleeland's solicitor, Mark Newby, said: ""These documents are highly significant and they should have been disclosed to the defence at the time of the trial. They would have had a material impact on the outcome of the case."" The CCRC has confirmed that it has received Mr Cleeland's application and is considering whether to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal. Mr Cleeland said: ""I have always maintained my innocence and I am determined to clear my name. I hope that the CCRC will finally agree to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal so that I can have a fair trial."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We are aware of the application made to the CCRC. We will be co-operating fully with their investigation.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Theresa May said Dame Millicent ""continues to inspire the next generation"" of women, and that her statue will show young girls they can ""achieve anything they set their mind to."" Fawcett was a leading figure in the women's suffrage movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was the founder and president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), and she played a key role in the campaign for women's right to vote. Fawcett's statue will be the first of a woman in Parliament Square, which is home to statues of some of Britain's most famous historical figures. The statue has been designed by Gillian Wearing, a Turner Prize-winning artist. The statue will be unveiled in 2022, which will mark the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act, which gave women the right to vote. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a fitting tribute to a woman who made a significant contribution to British history. Her statue will be a reminder of the long struggle for women's rights, and it will inspire future generations of women to fight for equality. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a reminder of the progress that has been made in the fight for women's rights, but it is also a reminder that there is still more to be done. Women around the world still face discrimination and violence, and they are still underrepresented in positions of power. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a call to action. It is a reminder that we must continue to fight for equality for women, and that we must not rest until women are truly equal in all aspects of life. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a symbol of hope. It is a reminder that change is possible, and that even the most difficult battles can be won. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a tribute to a woman who dedicated her life to fighting for equality, and it is an inspiration to us all to continue her work.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nóra Quoirin: 'Compelling evidence' of abduction,"Nóra Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast, disappeared from her room at the Dusun resort on 4 August 2019. Her body was found 10 days later about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the resort in a rainforest. The post-mortem examination found that Nóra died as a result of starvation and stress. In announcing the results of the second inquest, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said there was ""compelling evidence"" that Nóra had been abducted. She said: ""I find that it is more likely than not that Nóra was abducted from the Dusun resort on the night of 3 August 2019 and that she was taken to the location where she was found deceased."" The coroner said that Nóra's disappearance had been ""a mystery from the start"" and that she had considered ""all possible scenarios"". She said: ""I have considered all the possible scenarios, including the possibility that Nóra wandered off and got lost, but I do not find this to be a likely explanation. ""I have also considered the possibility that Nóra was killed by a wild animal, but I do not find this to be a likely explanation either."" The coroner said that the key piece of evidence in the case was the fact that Nóra's body was found in a stream. She said: ""The fact that Nóra's body was found in a stream is significant because there is no evidence to suggest that Nóra was able to swim. ""I find it more likely than not that Nóra was placed in the stream after she died."" The coroner said that she had also considered the possibility that Nóra had been killed by a human being. She said: ""I cannot rule out the possibility that Nóra was killed by a human being, but I do not find this to be the most likely explanation."" The coroner said that she had come to her conclusion after considering all the evidence in the case. She said: ""I have come to this conclusion after considering all the evidence in the case, including the post-mortem examination report, the scene examination report, and the witness statements."" The coroner said that she hoped that her findings would provide some closure for Nóra's family. She said: ""I hope that my findings will provide some closure for Nóra's family and that they will be able to find some peace in knowing that her body has been found and that she is now at rest.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Waspi campaign: The fight against changes to women's state pension age,"By Reality Check team BBC News That effort goes back decades, so to help understand the issue here is some background. How did we get here? From 1948 for more than 60 years men received their state pension at 65 and women at 60. However, concerned about the impact of an ageing population and the rising cost of state pensions, in 1995 the government announced plans to equalise the state pension age for men and women at 65. This was always going to be a controversial move and a campaign was quickly launched to oppose it, led by the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) movement. The campaign argued that the changes were unfair to women who had been paying National Insurance contributions based on the assumption they would get their pension at 60. They also pointed out that many women, particularly those who worked in lower paid jobs, had been unable to build up enough private pension provision to compensate for the loss of their state pension for five years. The government did make some concessions in response to the campaign, such as bringing forward to 2026 the date when the state pension age for women would reach 65 and introducing a transitional period during which women born in the 1950s would receive some additional state pension payments. However, Waspi argued that these concessions did not go far enough and continued to campaign for the changes to be scrapped altogether. What's the current status? In 2019, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman published a report which found that the government had failed to communicate the changes to the state pension age adequately, particularly to women born in the 1950s. The Ombudsman recommended that the government should make a one-off payment of £12,000 to women affected by this communication failure. The government has accepted this recommendation and is in the process of making these payments. However, Waspi is still campaigning for further compensation, arguing that the government should fully compensate women who lost out financially as a result of the changes to the state pension age. The government has so far resisted these calls, but the issue is likely to remain a source of political debate for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fifth of UK women decline cervical smear tests,"Early detection through screening, followed by treatment, can prevent up to 75% of these cancers developing. Yet despite high-profile cases such as that of Jade Goody, who died of the disease aged 27 in 2009, the uptake of cervical screening continues to fall. In England, only 68.6% of women aged 25 to 64 attended a screening appointment in the year to March 2022, down from 83.4% in 2000. The decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including embarrassment, fear of pain, and a lack of awareness about the importance of screening. Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""It is worrying to see that so many women are not taking up this potentially life-saving screening."" She added: ""Cervical screening is not painful and only takes a few minutes. The benefits of screening far outweigh any discomfort that women may experience."" There are a number of things that can be done to improve the uptake of cervical screening. These include: Raising awareness of the importance of screening through public health campaigns and school education programs. Making it easier for women to access screening appointments, by offering them at convenient times and locations. Providing information about the screening process in a clear and accessible way. Training healthcare professionals to be sensitive and supportive when discussing cervical screening with women. By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that more women benefit from the life-saving benefits of cervical screening. In addition to the reasons cited by Dr Saliba, other factors that may be contributing to the decline in cervical screening uptake include: A belief that cervical screening is no longer necessary because of the availability of the HPV vaccine. A fear of being judged or stigmatized for having a sexually transmitted infection (STI). A lack of trust in healthcare professionals. It is important to note that the HPV vaccine does not eliminate the need for cervical screening. While the vaccine protects against the most common strains of HPV, it does not protect against all strains. It is therefore still important for women to have regular cervical screenings to check for any abnormal cells that could develop into cancer. It is also important to remember that cervical screening is a private and confidential procedure. Healthcare professionals are bound by law to protect the privacy of their patients. If you are concerned about being judged or stigmatized, you can speak to your doctor or nurse in confidence. If you have any concerns about cervical screening, please speak to your doctor or nurse. They will be able to provide you with more information about the screening process and answer any questions you may have.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Northamptonshire was 'hair's breadth' from tier 3,"The county will remain under tier two rules, as it has been since England's second national lockdown ended. Lucy Wightman, director of Public Health Northamptonshire, said people should remain ""vigilant"". The government will review the tiers again on December 16, and it is possible that Northamptonshire could move into tier three at that point. Wightman said: ""The data shows we are still in a vulnerable position, and we are just a hair's breadth away from moving into tier three. ""It is vital that we all remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidance to protect ourselves, our families and our communities."" The latest figures show that Northamptonshire has a rate of 119.7 cases per 100,000 people, which is slightly below the national average of 126.2. However, the number of cases in the county has been increasing in recent weeks, and the government is concerned that the county could soon move into tier three. If Northamptonshire does move into tier three, it would mean that all non-essential shops would have to close, and people would only be allowed to meet in groups of six outdoors. Wightman said that she is hopeful that Northamptonshire will be able to avoid moving into tier three, but she urged people to continue to follow the guidance. She said: ""We all need to play our part to keep the virus under control. ""Please continue to wash your hands regularly, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and keep your distance from others. ""If you have any symptoms of Covid-19, please self-isolate and get tested immediately."" The government has said that it will review the tiers again on December 16, and it is possible that Northamptonshire could move into tier three at that point.

Norfolk and Waveney mental health: Dissatisfaction with care,"The survey, by the Norfolk and Waveney Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), said 40% did not know how to access services at their GP practice. Steven Rose, the STP's lead for mental health, said the issue had been identified as a priority. ""There's quite a lot of work going on at the moment to improve access, for example, developing a single point of access for mental health services across Norfolk and Waveney,"" he said. ""It's really important that people in the area know how to access mental health services as they need them."" A spokesman for NHS Norfolk and Waveney Clinical Commissioning Group said: ""We recognise that there are challenges in accessing mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney, and we are working to improve this. ""We are investing in a range of initiatives, including expanding the number of mental health staff and improving access to services through digital channels."" The survey also found that 32% of respondents had experienced discrimination or stigma related to their mental health. Mr Rose said: ""Discrimination and stigma can have a devastating impact on people's lives, and it can make it even harder for people to get the help they need. ""We need to challenge discrimination and stigma whenever and wherever we see it."" He added: ""It's important to remember that mental health is just as important as physical health, and everyone deserves to access the support they need."" The STP is working with a range of partners to improve mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney. This includes working with Norfolk and Waveney Mind, a mental health charity, to provide a range of services, including peer support groups and counselling.

Welsh theatre company launches translation app,"By Ian Youngs Arts reporter, BBC News Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, the Welsh-language national theatre, has developed the smartphone app called Sibrwd, which means Whisper. It will allow audience members to hear key lines and explanations of scenes in English. The theatre hopes it will help non-Welsh speakers, tourists, and deaf and hard of hearing people to enjoy its productions. Sibrwd is the latest example of how apps and technology are being used to make theatre more inclusive. In 2016, the Royal Shakespeare Company launched an app called RSC Play On, which provides closed captions, audio descriptions, and sign language interpretation for its productions. And in 2017, the National Theatre launched an app called NT Live, which allows audiences to watch live and recorded performances on their phones and tablets. Sibrwd is different from these other apps in that it is designed specifically for Welsh-language theatre. ""We wanted to create something that would help people who might not be fluent in Welsh to enjoy our productions,"" said Elen Bowman, the theatre's artistic director. ""We hope it will make our work more accessible to a wider audience."" The app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play. It is available for all of the theatre's main stage productions, as well as for some of its touring shows. Users can select the language they want to hear the translation in, and they can adjust the volume and speed of the narration. The app also includes a glossary of Welsh words and phrases, and a guide to Welsh pronunciation. ""We hope Sibrwd will help to break down some of the barriers that can prevent people from enjoying Welsh-language theatre,"" said Bowman. ""We want to make our work as accessible as possible to everyone."" Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru is not the first Welsh theatre company to use technology to make its work more inclusive. In 2015, the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff launched an app called Theatr Clwyd, which provides audio descriptions and closed captions for its productions. And in 2016, the National Theatre Wales launched an app called Theatr na n'Og, which provides Welsh-language and English-language content for children. The use of technology to make theatre more inclusive is a welcome development. It is helping to make theatre more accessible to a wider range of people, and it is making it possible for people to enjoy theatre in new and different ways.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scotland weather: More gales hit parts of Scotland,"High winds battering the coast are expected to ease as an area of low pressure continues to move across northern parts of the country. Flood alerts and warnings have been issued for several areas, with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) urging people to be prepared for flooding. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for wind for much of Scotland, which is in place until 15:00 GMT. The warning covers the Highlands and Islands, Grampian, Tayside, Fife, Central, Lothian Borders, Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway. Gusts of up to 70mph are expected in some areas, with the strongest winds likely to be in the west and north of Scotland. The Met Office is also warning of the potential for snow and ice on higher ground, especially in the north. SEPA has issued 10 flood alerts and three flood warnings for Scotland. The alerts are in place for the following areas: River Spey at Grantown-on-Spey River Deveron at Banff River Don at Alford River Dee at Banchory River Tay at Perth River Earn at Crieff River Leven at Leven River Clyde at Glasgow River Annan at Annan River Nith at Dumfries SEPA is urging people in these areas to be prepared for flooding and to take steps to protect their homes and businesses. The agency is also advising people to avoid walking or driving through flood water, as even shallow water can be fast-flowing and dangerous. The Scottish government has also issued a warning to the public, urging people to be aware of the risks of flooding and to follow the advice of SEPA. The government is also working with local authorities to ensure that they are prepared to respond to any flooding incidents. The weather is expected to improve later today, with the wind and rain easing. However, SEPA is warning that flooding could still occur in some areas, even after the rain has stopped.

Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show,"The adult film star was expected to be one of the housemates this series, which started on Thursday night. But she pulled out at the last minute, and her lawyer said producers ""tried to bully and intimidate her"" into changing her mind. In a statement released shortly before the new series began, Celebrity Big Brother said: ""Stormy Daniels has been offered a place in the Celebrity Big Brother house on numerous occasions. Despite agreeing to enter the house yesterday, Stormy Daniels' lawyer subsequently informed us that she had withdrawn from the agreement and would not be entering the house."" The statement continued: ""Celebrity Big Brother is a reality TV show in which celebrities live together in a house for several weeks, with no contact with the outside world. As such, potential housemates are required to sign an extensive contract which sets out the conditions of their stay. Any failure by a housemate to observe the terms of their contract may result in disciplinary measures, including removal from the house."" Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has said that his client was ""coerced"" into signing the contract and that she was ""harassed and intimidated"" by producers in the lead-up to the show. He has also said that Daniels was offered a ""significant sum of money"" to enter the house, but that she ultimately decided to pull out because she felt that the show was ""not a good fit"" for her. Celebrity Big Brother has not commented on Avenatti's allegations. However, a source close to the show has said that Daniels was ""fully aware"" of the terms of her contract and that she was not pressured into signing it. The source also said that Daniels had been offered a ""fair and reasonable"" amount of money to appear on the show, and that she had been given ample time to consider her decision. The decision to pull out of Celebrity Big Brother is a major blow for Stormy Daniels, who has been hoping to use the show to raise her profile and promote her upcoming book. It is also a blow for the show, which has been struggling to attract viewers in recent years. It remains to be seen whether Stormy Daniels will ever appear on Celebrity Big Brother. However, it is clear that her decision to pull out at the last minute has caused a great deal of controversy and has cast a shadow over the new series.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Australian political parties hit by 'state actor' hack, PM says","The cyber-attack revealed two weeks ago was carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"", he said. But he added there was ""no evidence of any electoral interference"". The nation will face more attacks of this nature in future, he said, and the government was ""taking this very seriously"". The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is investigating the attack, which targeted the Liberal and National Parties, the Labor Party and the Greens. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said the attack was a ""wake-up call"" for Australia. ""This is a serious incident and it's important that we get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""We need to be doing everything we can to protect our democracy from these kinds of attacks."" The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the attack was a ""threat to our democracy"". ""This is a very serious issue and we need to make sure that our electoral system is protected,"" he said. The cyber-attack is the latest in a series of incidents that have raised concerns about the security of Australia's electoral system. In 2015, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was hacked, and in 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics was targeted. The AEC has since implemented a number of security measures to protect its systems, including introducing multi-factor authentication and encryption. However, the government has been accused of not doing enough to protect the nation from cyber-attacks. The Labor Party has called for the government to establish a national cybersecurity agency, and the Greens have called for a ban on foreign interference in elections. The government has said it is committed to protecting the nation from cyber-attacks, and has introduced a number of measures to do so. These include establishing the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), which provides advice and assistance to businesses and individuals on how to protect themselves from cyber-attacks.

Home ownership 'overestimated by official data',"The official estimate of a 64% home ownership rate was too high, the Resolution Foundation said, as many people shared or owners had taken on extended family members during the pandemic. The think tank said this ""disguised"" a fall in owner-occupation, to a true rate of 62%. It said the government should focus on supporting home ownership among lower-income households, renters, and first-time buyers. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the government is ""committed to increasing home ownership"". The official figures count anyone who owns a home, even if they share it with others, as a home owner. Before the pandemic, around one in seven of all households in England contained multiple adult generations, or two or more unrelated adults. During the pandemic, however, that figure rose to one in four as many people moved in with family or friends because of the high cost of housing and the need for childcare. This inflated the official count of home owners by about 300,000, the Resolution Foundation estimated. The think tank said its ""true"" home ownership rate of 62% is in line with other recent estimates. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""These figures expose the government's failure to get to grips with the housing emergency. ""Home ownership shouldn't be a pipe dream for most. But the harsh reality is that our broken housing system is pricing millions of people out of a decent home. ""Millions of people are trapped in the renting trap, unable to save for a home of their own. The government must deliver a new deal for renters and build more social homes."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to increasing home ownership and ensuring everyone has a safe and secure place to live. ""We have supported over 800,000 first-time buyers onto the property ladder since 2010, and have invested over £12 billion to support affordable housing.

Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn,"The start-up's flagship product, the Oculus Rift, is a goggle-like ""immersive"" headset for video gaming. It was developed with funds raised through crowdfunding site Kickstarter, before the start-up went on to receive further investment from venture capitalists. The deal with Facebook could help Oculus Rift gain wider consumer recognition. Facebook said it plans to keep the Oculus team intact, and even to expand it by hiring more engineers. The company also said it would ""work with developers to explore new ways of interacting with each other online"", rather than solely focusing on video gaming. Facebook's purchase of Oculus Rift is the first major acquisition by the social networking company since its $19bn purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp last year. The acquisition is also the latest in a series of investments by Facebook in virtual reality, a technology that allows users to experience simulated environments as if they are real. In March this year, Facebook bought virtual reality production company, Surreal Vision. It also formed a virtual reality team at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. And in June, Facebook announced that it was developing a virtual reality headset that users could control with their thoughts. The latest deal is further evidence of Facebook's commitment to virtual reality, a technology that many see as the future of entertainment and communication. It is not yet clear how Facebook plans to integrate Oculus Rift into its existing products. However, the acquisition could give Facebook a significant boost in the virtual reality market. The deal is also a sign of the growing importance of virtual reality. With Facebook's backing, Oculus Rift is now one of the most high-profile virtual reality headsets on the market. This could help to drive consumer adoption of virtual reality, and make it a more mainstream technology.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lorry drivers who drink coffee 'cut their crash risk',"By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online Australian investigators say they found the link while comparing 530 heavy goods vehicle drivers who had recently been in a crash with 517 who had not. Coffee and other beverages containing the stimulant caffeine helped counter the effects of fatigue, say the researchers writing in the journal Sleep. The researchers from the University of Sydney and the University of Adelaide also found that the more caffeine the drivers consumed, the lower was their risk of crashing. Those drivers who had the highest levels of the caffeine breakdown product paraxanthine in their urine had a 63% reduced risk of being in a crash compared with the drivers with the lowest levels. ""The reduction in crash risk was likely due to caffeine's effects on alertness,"" said Dr Harriet Hiscock, lead author of the study from the University of Sydney. She added that the effects of a single cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink could last for several hours, ""which is the length of a typical work shift for a heavy vehicle driver."" Previous research has shown that the hours between midnight and 6am are when the most fatigue-related truck crashes occur, she added. Fatigue is more common among long-distance drivers who may be working long hours and driving through the night. Dr Hiscock recommended that heavy vehicle drivers with long work hours should consider increasing their intake of caffeine, such as by drinking two to three cups of coffee before starting work and having more as the work shift progresses. ""The risk of consuming too much caffeine and experiencing side-effects like insomnia is very low in healthy adults,"" she said. ""The benefits of consuming caffeine to reduce fatigue and crash risk appear to outweigh any risks associated with moderate caffeine intake."" The researchers say that studies have shown that caffeine can help with alertness, attention, memory and reaction time. It can also reduce feelings of fatigue and sleepiness. Dr Hiscock said that in addition to consuming caffeine, drivers should take breaks when they feel fatigued, avoid working long hours and avoid driving while on medication that causes drowsiness. She said that there was also a need for more research to examine the relationship between caffeine and other factors that can affect crash risk, such as age, experience, and road and traffic conditions. ""In the meantime,"" she said, ""caffeine appears to be a useful strategy for reducing the risk of fatigue-related crashes in heavy vehicle drivers.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Richard Wadani: Austrian Nazi deserter dies aged 97,"Richard Wadani was drafted into the German army but escaped on his second attempt in 1944, going on to serve in a British-led unit. After the end of the conflict, he helped prosecute his former comrades and settled in the UK. Born in April 1925, he was the youngest of four children. His family was Jewish, but not religious, and lived in a predominantly Christian area of Vienna. After the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, his father was arrested and sent to the Dachau concentration camp. He was released after six weeks, but the family was forced to give up their business and home. Richard was conscripted into the German army in 1943 and sent to the Eastern Front. He was captured by the Soviets in 1944, but escaped during a train journey to a prisoner-of-war camp. He made his way to Vienna, where he hid for several months before joining a group of Jewish partisans. In 1945, Richard joined the British-led Jewish Brigade, which fought alongside the Allies in Italy. After the war, he helped prosecute Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials. In 1947, he settled in the UK, where he worked as a builder and later as a social worker. Richard rarely spoke about his experiences during the war, but he was a strong advocate for Holocaust education and reconciliation. He visited schools and gave talks about the dangers of prejudice and discrimination. In 2015, he was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, First Class, for his work in promoting understanding and tolerance. He died on 15 March 2023, aged 97.

West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service currently has 12 fire engines at the scene and has asked members of the public to avoid the area. The fire service said there are ""no immediate concerns for public safety"" but the blaze is ""causing significant damage to the moorland"". The fire is believed to have started between Wessenden Head and the A640, and is the second large moorland fire in West Yorkshire in less than a month. The National Trust said it believed the fire was started deliberately and had been ""totally avoidable"". ""We're shocked and saddened by the damage this fire has caused to the beautiful landscape of Marsden Moor,"" said the National Trust's general manager for the area, Rob Stoneman. ""We know the vast majority of people would never dream of doing anything to harm such a special place, but a minority seem hell-bent on destroying it.

Taj Mahal: mud-pack treatment for pollution stains,"The treatment is hoped to restore the natural sheen and colour of the white marble monument. It will be the fourth time the 17th century mausoleum has had the treatment. The last mud-pack was applied in 2018. The Taj Mahal is one of India's most iconic landmarks, and is visited by millions of tourists each year. However, the pollution in the surrounding area has taken its toll on the building, and the white marble has become stained and discoloured. The mud-pack treatment is a traditional Indian method of cleaning marble. It involves applying a paste made from clay, water and herbs to the surface of the marble. The paste is left to dry for several hours, and then washed off with water. The mud-pack is said to remove dirt, grime and pollution stains from the marble. It is also said to help to restore the marble's natural sheen and colour. The Taj Mahal is not the only building to have been treated with a mud-pack. The Red Fort in Delhi and the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata have also undergone the treatment. The mud-pack treatment is a relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly way to clean marble. It is also a traditional method that has been used for centuries. However, the treatment is not without its critics.

Police chief responds to Fred West 'murder victim' petition,"Fifteen-year-old Mary Bastholm was last seen alive in Gloucester 44 years ago. Gloucestershire Police is being petitioned to carry out a fresh investigation into her reported murder by serial killer Fred West, after new evidence was uncovered by amateur detectives. Gloucester's Police Chief Supt Ian Chisolm, said: ""The remains of Mary Bastholm have never been found and no-one has ever been charged with her murder. ""The investigation into her murder remains open and we will continue to investigate any new information that is brought to our attention. ""In 2015, following media interest in the case, we agreed to review the investigation to ensure that all possible lines of enquiry had been exhausted. ""This review was overseen by an independent detective chief inspector. ""As part of this review, Gloucestershire Police liaised with the relevant authorities in Portugal where Mary's parents were living at the time of her disappearance. ""We also met with Mary's family in the UK to provide an update on the investigation. ""The review concluded that all reasonable lines of enquiry had been exhausted and that there was no new evidence to suggest that Fred West was involved in Mary's disappearance or murder. Pete Moore, who runs the 'Mary Bastholm Murder Investigation' Facebook group, said: ""In 2017, myself and three other volunteers started looking into the case. ""Last year, we took our findings to Gloucestershire Police. ""They said our investigation matched their own but we had taken it a stage further. ""We believe there is enough evidence to prove that Fred West abducted Mary and murdered her at his Cromwell Street home."" Mary's younger sister Janet added: ""We want Gloucestershire Police to follow up on all the evidence that we've presented to them. ""We want them to take a fresh look at it and see if they can find Mary's remains. ""We need to know what happened to her. ""It would be the best outcome if we could find out what happened."" Mr Moore said that the retired officer added he was assisting the BBC in making a programme about the case. The petition states: ""The family of Mary Bastholm and an independent group of investigators have presented new evidence that we believe may finally solve a 44-year-old murder mystery. ""We ask Gloucestershire Police to take ownership of this compelling new information and investigate with the aim of finding Mary Bastholm's body and finally securing justice for her family and loved ones and ending the decades of torment they have suffered.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
GCSE computing tasks withdrawn after answers appear online,"By Judith Burns Education reporter, BBC News The exam board OCR has confirmed the units will be ""replaced"" to avoid the risk of students gaining an unfair advantage. It follows claims that answers to the GCSE exam papers were posted online before the exams had taken place. OCR said it was made aware of ""potential issues"" with the Computing units on 18 May - the same day the exams were sat. The board said an investigation was launched immediately and a decision to withdraw the units was made shortly afterwards. It is understood that the papers had been leaked online and that students had accessed them before the exams. The move to withdraw the units affects students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a statement, OCR said: ""We are aware of some potential issues with the GCSE (9-1) Computing units 1 and 2 that have been brought to our attention. ""As a result, we have taken the decision to replace units 1 and 2 only. ""This decision has been made to ensure there is no unfair advantage given to any students."" The board said it was still investigating the leak and that it would be ""taking all necessary actions"" to prevent a similar incident happening again. It added that it would be providing further updates to students and schools as soon as possible. The move to withdraw the units has been met with anger from some students and parents. One student, who asked not to be named, said: ""I'm really angry. I've been revising for this exam for months and now it's been cancelled because of someone else's mistake. ""It's not fair."" A parent of a student who was due to sit the exam said: ""I'm furious. My child has worked so hard for this exam and now it's been taken away from them. ""OCR needs to take responsibility for this and ensure that it doesn't happen again."" The exam board has said it is committed to ensuring that all students are treated fairly and that they will be working closely with schools to provide support during this time.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Small businesses in Scottish council spend call,"The FSB said public bodies should be required to publish regular assessments of how they spend their cash. It argued they should also have to identify areas for improvement. The FSB called for a ""small business act"" to give small firms more representation on public sector boards. The move would create a powerful voice for small businesses to challenge public sector spending decisions. It would also help to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance of winning public sector contracts. The FSB said that small businesses were often overlooked by public sector bodies. It said that this was because small businesses did not have the resources to lobby or tender for contracts. The FSB's call for action was welcomed by the Scottish government. A spokesperson said that the government was committed to supporting small businesses. The spokesperson said that the government would consider the FSB's proposals. The Scottish government has a target of increasing the number of public sector contracts awarded to small businesses to 25%. The target was set in 2014. The government has made some progress towards meeting the target. In 2016, 22% of public sector contracts were awarded to small businesses. However, the government is still some way short of meeting its target. The FSB's proposals would help the government to meet its target. The proposals would also help to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance of winning public sector contracts. The FSB's call for action is a positive step. It is important that small businesses have a voice in public sector spending decisions. The FSB's proposals would help to ensure that this happens.

George Alagiah's debut novel up for author's award,"Alagiah's The Burning Land, is up for the Paul Torday memorial prize, awarded to a first novel by a writer over 60. The thriller's plot revolves around corruption and homicide. It follows the story of Charles Hilary, a headteacher who has rebuilt his life in Kenya 10 years after his wife's death in a car accident.  His existence is challenged when he is drawn into a police investigation of a murder and corruption in a local school. Speaking to the BBC, Alagiah said the book had been ""percolating"" for many years and was inspired by many visits to Kenya and his experiences there. ""It was an attempt to think through some of the dilemmas and issues facing the country, particularly corruption,"" he said. ""I wanted to write a story that is hopeful, ultimately, about people's resilience and determination to live their lives and bring up their families with dignity."" The Paul Torday prize is named after the author of Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, who died of cancer in 2012. Chair of judges Elizabeth Buchan said the prize celebrated ""the most exciting and original"" debut novelists over 60. ""It is a great pleasure to announce the longlist for this year's prize, which contains so many vivid, compelling and original voices,"" she said. Alagiah, who turned 65 on 22 November 2022, is best known to the public as a newsreader, having been a BBC journalist for over 30 years. He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014, and subsequently wrote about his experience in a memoir, The Burning Land, published in 2022. Alagiah said that writing a novel had always been ""a little bit of a dream"" for him. ""I've always found writing very enjoyable, but the news is so relentless and so time-consuming that it was very hard to make the time to do it,"" he said. ""But my illness gave me the opportunity to step back. I've not given up broadcasting, but I'm only doing one day a week now, so I've carved out some time to write."" Alagiah said he was ""thrilled"" that The Burning Land had been shortlisted for the Paul Torday prize. ""It's a great honour,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to reading the other books on the longlist and seeing who wins.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Trade deal now looking remote,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The big sticking points remain: EU fishermen's access to UK waters, and the UK's plans to potentially undercut EU standards on issues such as workers' rights. Both sides are now saying that, without movement, a no-deal Brexit is the most likely scenario - although they insist they want to keep talking. So what would no-deal mean? Economically, it would lead to tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the UK and the EU - so that means higher costs for businesses and consumers. The food and drink sector, for example, says prices will go up - and some produce might not even be available. Manufacturers and retailers warn of disruption to supply chains. More than just a question of economics, a no-deal Brexit would also mean the UK would no longer take part in EU programmes - for example, the research and development programme Horizon or the Erasmus student exchange scheme. UK universities are worried about how they will continue to collaborate with European partners. And for UK businesses, it means losing the right to trade freely across the EU - they would face new checks and restrictions. For travel, it would mean the end of freedom of movement within the EU. British passport holders would need visas to stay in the EU for longer than 90 days. Tourists would have to check roaming charges. And it would mean British citizens who live in the EU could lose some of their rights. So what about those lorry queues? Under no-deal, there would be new checks and customs controls on goods entering or leaving the UK. If these are not ready by the end of the year, it is highly likely we will see major delays and congestion at ports. This will not just affect UK food and industry, but also businesses in the EU that rely on the UK. This is perhaps one of the most urgent issues that needs to be resolved. And the UK government says it will be ready. It says it has already massively increased capacity at ports, and it will be setting up inland customs sites. But there are many who remain highly sceptical as to whether this is enough. And the government admits that there will be some disruption. For its part, the EU has been planning too. Its negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been setting up lorry parks - essentially giant car parks where vehicles can be stored while awaiting customs checks. The UK wants to avoid this. But no-deal would not just be economically and logistically challenging. It would also be a huge diplomatic headache. The UK would have to negotiate new agreements with countries around the world. It will probably have to join the World Trade Organization and sign up to its rules. And it will have to work out how to maintain open borders with the Republic of Ireland if Northern Ireland is following EU rules. For many people, this would be a big departure from the UK's current position, as a member of a large trading bloc. The government says it will be able to continue to trade with the EU. But it is acknowledged that there will be costs to the UK economy, and that no-deal will make the UK a less attractive place to do business. The EU's message is that it will survive without the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Suspected Tamil rebels shot dead in Sri Lanka,"By Charles Haviland BBC News, Colombo It says they were taking instructions from two LTTE leaders based in Europe. The reported incident, if true, is the first such admission by the Sri Lankan authorities of extra-judicial killings carried out in the final phase of the civil war. Tamil politicians told the BBC that the men killed were suspected of links to the LTTE but not of involvement in violence. They said the men were shot after they tried to flee a house that had been surrounded by the military in the final months of the conflict. The LTTE was defeated in May 2009 after a 26-year campaign for an independent Tamil homeland. The Sri Lankan government has been accused of serious human rights abuses during the final months of the war, including the extra-judicial killing of suspected Tamil Tiger rebels. The government denies the allegations, but a UN panel appointed by then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon concluded that the Sri Lankan military had been responsible for ""credible allegations"" of extra-judicial killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. The group of men now reported to have been shot dead is said to have included a former town mayor, a local councillor and several businessmen. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main Tamil political party, has called for an independent investigation into the killings. The government has not commented on the allegations. The reported incident has taken place against a backdrop of growing international pressure on Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of war crimes and other human rights abuses committed during the final months of the civil war. In March, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling on Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the UN panel and to establish a credible mechanism to investigate allegations of war crimes. The Sri Lankan government has said that it will not accept any external interference in its internal affairs. However, the international community is likely to continue to press for accountability for the alleged crimes committed during the war. The reported incident is a reminder of the dark chapter in Sri Lanka's history and of the need for the country to confront its past in order to build a truly reconciled and peaceful future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wirelessly charged electric buses set for Milton Keynes,"By Neil Bowdler Science and technology reporter, BBC News A fleet of eight new electric vehicles will operate along a busy route in Milton Keynes from late January. The buses can run for longer than previous models because they are fitted with wireless charging technology, avoiding the need for regular overnight charging.  Rapid charging points are located at bus stops along the H5 route, which connects the new university quarter to the city centre via Milton Keynes Central railway station. The vehicles will charge for four minutes while passengers get on and off at the stops. The buses, which are made by Chinese company Yutong and are known as E12s, are replacing diesel vehicles on the route. Each bus can carry up to 90 passengers. Wireless charging is achieved through the use of a charging plate installed under the road at bus stops. As the bus parks over the plate, it begins to receive an electric current. The system is designed to be efficient and safe, with no risk of electric shocks or damage to the bus or the road surface. The wireless charging system has been developed by a consortium of companies including Milton Keynes Council, bus operator Arriva UK Bus, power company UK Power Networks and infrastructure firm Conduent. Milton Keynes Council leader Pete Marland said: “We are leading the UK in developing innovative solutions to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. These new electric buses will make a real difference to the lives of people in Milton Keynes, providing a cleaner, greener and more reliable public transport service.” Arriva UK Bus managing director Paul O'Neil said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Milton Keynes Council and other stakeholders to bring this exciting new technology to Milton Keynes. These new electric buses will provide a significant improvement to the customer experience, with faster journey times and reduced emissions.” The introduction of the electric buses is part of Milton Keynes Council’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. The council has already invested in a number of other green initiatives, including the installation of solar panels on council buildings and the planting of trees.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lundy Island visitors return to mainland after ferry failure,"The MS Oldenburg arrived to collect 65 holidaymakers on Saturday but had a mechanical fault and was towed back. The Landmark Trust, which leases the island, found extra accommodation for the stranded visitors. On Sunday, another vessel, the MV Balmoral, was dispatched to the island. The 65 holidaymakers disembarked the MV Balmoral at Ilfracombe, Devon, at around 17:00 BST. One of the stranded visitors, Dave Thornton, said it had been a ""great adventure"". ""We were supposed to be leaving on Saturday morning, but the ferry broke down,"" he said. ""We were supposed to be going home on Saturday, but we ended up staying on the island for two extra nights."" ""The Landmark Trust made us very welcome,"" he added. The MV Balmoral is expected to return to Lundy Island on Monday to collect the remaining visitors. The Landmark Trust said in a statement: ""We are pleased that the holidaymakers have been able to return to the mainland. ""The safety of our visitors is our top priority and we are grateful to the crew of the MV Balmoral for their assistance."" Lundy Island is a small island in the Bristol Channel, about 12 miles (19 km) off the coast of Devon. It is owned by the National Trust and is leased to the Landmark Trust.

Essex lorry deaths: Accused made earlier crossing attempt,"Essex Lorry Deaths: Accused Made Earlier Crossing Attempt The Vietnamese nationals, aged between 15 and 44, suffocated as they were transported from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet on 23 October last year. Jurors heard how the victims had been sealed in the pitch black unit with no ventilation or light for at least 12 hours, and that they died from a combination of suffocation and hyperthermia. The six defendants on trial for manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people include Ronan Hughes, 41, of Armagh, and Maurice Robinson, 26, of Craigavon, who are accused of being the ringleaders of the smuggling operation. The other defendants are Gheorghe Nica, 43, of Basildon; Alexandru-Ovidiu Hutanu, 33, of Grays; Christopher Kennedy, 24, of Co Armagh; and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham. All deny the charges. The court heard that Hughes and Robinson had made an earlier attempt to smuggle people into the UK using the same mode of transport. On that occasion, they had successfully transported 10 Vietnamese nationals in a refrigerated container from France to Ireland. However, the victims in the Essex lorry deaths were not so fortunate. Prosecuting barrister Bill Emlyn Jones QC told the jury that the defendants had shown ""callous disregard for human life"" by cramming the victims into the lorry in ""utterly dangerous and inhumane"" conditions. He said that the defendants had known that the journey would be long and dangerous, and that they had deliberately created a situation in which the victims were likely to die. The defense has argued that the defendants were not responsible for the deaths of the victims, and that they had been duped by people higher up the smuggling chain. They have also claimed that the victims had voluntarily entered the lorry, and that they had not been aware of the dangers involved. The trial is expected to last for several weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Golden and sea eagle decline since Dark Ages mapped,"Researchers looked at places named after eagles in Gaelic and Old English to help estimate populations of the birds in AD500. From the Dark Ages, they drew on historical material, such as laws protecting the birds, which are among Europe's largest birds of prey. Golden eagles are found across much of the UK, while sea eagles are only found in Scotland. Numbers of both species fell sharply since the Middle Ages. The study suggests the biggest decline took place between AD800 and AD1100, though this varied regionally. In the Highlands of Scotland, for example, golden eagles made a recovery, with their numbers peaking around AD1200. This is in contrast to the rest of the UK, where numbers continued to fall after AD1100. This detailed study shows how golden and sea eagle populations have fluctuated over the centuries, providing important context for understanding current conservation efforts. Dr Justin Dodd of Royal Holloway, University of London, who led the research, said: ""Our work gives us a better and more detailed understanding of the historical changes in the fortunes of these magnificent birds, and can help inform future conservation action."" The research was motivated by the lack of long-term data on golden and sea eagle populations in Britain. To address this, the team of scientists used historical ecology to look at the spatial and temporal dynamics of the birds over many centuries. The team searched online gazetteers for place names that referenced eagles, such as ""Aird an Iolair"" (Eagle Height) in Scotland and ""Lydd"" (meaning ""eagle"") in England. They found 1,126 place names across Britain that contained the word ""eagle"" or a direct translation. Combining this data with historical sources, including legal documents and medieval chronicles, allowed the researchers to reconstruct the likely distribution of eagles in different parts of Britain at a series of different time periods since AD500. This provides the first detailed historical map of golden and sea eagle distribution and abundance in Britain. The researchers also discovered that the total area across Britain occupied by golden and sea eagles has declined by nearly two-thirds since AD500.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Homeless people struggle to access healthcare, report says","A third of people surveyed by housing charity Cymorth Cymru said health problems contributed to them losing their home. Seven recommendations have been made to health boards and the Welsh government to improve access to healthcare for homeless people. The report, published on Tuesday, found that homeless people often face barriers to accessing healthcare, including a lack of ID, difficulties registering with a GP, and stigma. One in five people surveyed said they had been refused healthcare because they did not have an ID. A quarter said they had been treated with disrespect by healthcare staff. The report makes seven recommendations to health boards and the Welsh government, including: Establishing a system to allow homeless people to register with a GP without an ID Providing training for healthcare staff on how to work with homeless people Setting up outreach services to provide healthcare to homeless people on the streets The report also calls for more research to be done on the health needs of homeless people. Cymorth Cymru's chief executive, Bethan Jones, said: ""Homeless people often face multiple barriers to accessing healthcare, including a lack of ID, difficulties registering with a GP, and stigma. This report highlights the need for urgent action to improve access to healthcare for homeless people."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that everyone in Wales has access to the healthcare they need, regardless of their circumstances.

JVP 'planned to kill' MP,"A senior leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Sunil Handunnetti, MP, is under house arrest by the party after he tried to flee the country, amid revelations that he and his brother had allegedly conspired to kill a fellow lawmaker. Handunnetti's attempted flight follows the arrest of his brother, Upul Shantha Handunnetti, by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on charges of planning to kill Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa, an opposition legislator. According to the CID, Upul Shantha Handunnetti had hired a group of hitmen to carry out the assassination, providing them with a firearm and a down payment of 1 million Sri Lankan rupees (around £4,300). The plot was allegedly hatched in response to an ongoing dispute between Rajapaksa and the JVP. Sources within the JVP have told the BBC that Sunil Handunnetti had been warned by senior party officials to cooperate with the investigation into his brother's alleged involvement in the assassination plot. However, he is believed to have ignored these warnings and attempted to flee the country. The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist party, has a long history of violence and political intimidation, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s when it launched an armed rebellion against the Sri Lankan government. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, the JVP has been active in mainstream politics, but it has continued to face accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuses. The arrest of Sunil Handunnetti and the allegations against his brother have raised concerns about the potential for further political violence in Sri Lanka. The CID is continuing its investigation into the assassination plot, and it is expected that further arrests will be made. The JVP has condemned the allegations against its members and has vowed to cooperate with the investigation. However, critics have accused the party of harbouring individuals who are capable of carrying out violence and intimidation. The allegations against the JVP have also cast a shadow over the upcoming parliamentary elections, which are scheduled to be held in August. The JVP is expected to perform well in the elections, but the revelations about its alleged involvement in a murder plot could damage its chances of gaining significant support.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had spoken to Green and made it clear that her comments were ""completely wrong"". ""The pandemic has been a terrible time for our country,"" he said. ""It has caused immense suffering and loss. To suggest that it is a 'good crisis' is deeply insensitive and offensive."" Green's apology was welcomed by some, but others said it was not enough. ""She needs to do more than just apologise,"" said bereaved families group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. ""She needs to resign from her position as an MP.""

Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules,"Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules The bill, which now returns to the lower house, also eases fines for some previous illegal clearance if farmers commit to a reforestation programme. Supporters say Brazil needs land for food production, but environmentalists warn of increased Amazon deforestation. The bill reduces the size of the protected Amazon biome by two million hectares (7,700 square miles) and opens up new areas to mining and other commercial activities. It also weakens environmental oversight and enforcement in the region. Environmentalists say the bill will lead to increased deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Amazon, which is the world's largest rainforest and a vital carbon sink. They argue that the government should be focusing on sustainable development and protecting the Amazon for future generations. ""This is a disaster for the Amazon and for the climate,"" said Marcio Astrini, the public policy coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Brazil. ""The government is putting short-term economic gain ahead of the long-term health of the planet."" The bill was approved by the Senate by a vote of 63 to 13. It now returns to the lower house of Congress, where it is expected to pass easily. The bill has been criticized by scientists, environmentalists, and indigenous groups. They argue that it will lead to increased deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Amazon, and that it will undermine Brazil's efforts to combat climate change. The bill's supporters say that it is necessary to open up more land for agriculture and other economic activities in order to meet the needs of Brazil's growing population. They also argue that the bill includes safeguards to protect the environment, such as the requirement that farmers commit to a reforestation programme if they clear land illegally. The bill is part of a broader effort by the Brazilian government to weaken environmental protections in the Amazon. In recent years, the government has reduced funding for environmental enforcement and has made it easier for companies to obtain permits to clear land in the rainforest. The weakening of environmental protections in the Amazon is a major concern for the international community. The Amazon is a vital carbon sink, and deforestation in the region contributes to climate change. The Amazon is also home to a vast array of biodiversity, and deforestation threatens the survival of many species. The international community has urged Brazil to strengthen, not weaken, environmental protections in the Amazon. In 2015, Brazil signed the Paris Agreement on climate change, which commits the country to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The weakening of environmental protections in the Amazon makes it more difficult for Brazil to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Australia to hold royal commission inquiry into banks,"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - would help restore confidence in the sector.

It will examine a wide range of issues, including lending practices, financial advice, and the culture of the banking industry. ""We need to restore trust in our financial system,"" Mr Turnbull said. ""This royal commission will help us to get to the bottom of the problems that have been identified and make sure that our banks are operating in a way that is in the best interests of all Australians."" The announcement of the royal commission has been welcomed by consumer groups and the opposition Labor Party. ""This is a significant step towards cleaning up the banking sector and rebuilding trust with the Australian people,"" said Labor leader Bill Shorten. The inquiry is expected to take about two years to complete. It will report its findings and recommendations to the government, which will then decide what action to take. Scandals involving Australian banks In recent years, Australian banks have been involved in a number of scandals, including: The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was found to have breached anti-money laundering laws on over 53,000 occasions. The National Australia Bank (NAB) was found to have charged fees for financial advice to dead customers. The Westpac Banking Corporation was found to have sold inappropriate financial products to customers. The ANZ Banking Group was found to have engaged in misleading conduct in relation to the sale of financial products. These scandals have led to a loss of trust in the banking sector. A recent survey found that only 37% of Australians trust banks to act in their best interests. The royal commission is expected to shed light on the causes of these scandals and make recommendations for how to prevent them from happening again.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk linked to skin tears',"Doctors say small tears in the skin from shaving or trimming could make it easier for infections to take hold. But they also say groomers - particularly extreme ones - tend to be more sexually active too. STIs are spread through contact with infected bodily fluids, such as during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. They can also be passed on from an infected mother to her baby during birth. There are a number of different types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis HIV Herpes HPV Symptoms of STIs can vary depending on the type of infection, but they may include: Painful or itchy genitals Discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or rashes on the genitals, anus, or mouth Swollen lymph nodes Fever Fatigue If you think you may have an STI, it is important to see a doctor or sexual health clinic as soon as possible. Treatment for STIs varies depending on the type of infection, but it may include antibiotics, antiviral medications, or surgery. There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk of getting an STI, including: Using condoms every time you have sex Getting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B Limiting your number of sexual partners Avoiding sex with people who have symptoms of an STI If you have any questions about STIs, please speak to your doctor or sexual health clinic. Pubic hair grooming and STI risk A number of studies have found a link between pubic hair grooming and an increased risk of STIs. One study, published in the journal ""Sexually Transmitted Infections"", found that women who groomed their pubic hair were more likely to have chlamydia and gonorrhea than women who did not groom their pubic hair. Another study, published in the journal ""The Lancet Infectious Diseases"", found that men who trimmed or shaved their pubic hair were more likely to have HIV than men who did not groom their pubic hair. The researchers believe that the increased risk of STIs among pubic hair groomers may be due to the fact that shaving or trimming can create small tears in the skin. These tears can then provide a pathway for bacteria and viruses to enter the body. Extreme pubic hair grooming Extreme pubic hair grooming, such as Brazilian waxing or laser hair removal, may further increase the risk of STIs. This is because these procedures can remove all of the hair from the pubic area, leaving the skin more exposed to bacteria and viruses. Conclusion The decision of whether or not to groom your pubic hair is a personal one. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with pubic hair grooming, including the increased risk of STIs. If you decide to groom your pubic hair, be sure to do so carefully to avoid creating tears in the skin.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Term-time holiday outlook - what might change?,"However, they maintain the policy to reduce school absence is ""clear and correct"" and they also plan to strengthen the statutory guidance on the issue to schools and local authorities. It was changes to this guidance that led to the most recent row. The government is consulting on a number of possible changes to the guidance, including: Reducing the number of authorised leave days for family holidays from 10 to five. Requiring parents to give schools more notice of any planned absence. Making schools responsible for ensuring that children are up to date with their work when they return from holiday. The consultation closes on 31 October, and the government is expected to publish its final decision in early 2023. Head teachers have welcomed the prospect of a change in the guidance, but they are concerned that the proposed changes do not go far enough. They argue that the number of authorised leave days should be reduced further, and that parents should be required to get permission from the head teacher before taking their children out of school at all. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has also called for the government to go further, arguing that the only way to reduce school absence is to make it a criminal offence for parents to take their children out of school without permission. The government has said that it is committed to reducing school absence, but it is also mindful of the need to avoid criminalising parents who simply want to spend time with their children. It is likely that the final decision will be a compromise between these two competing interests. In the meantime, parents should be aware that the rules on term-time holidays are likely to change in the near future. They should also be prepared for the possibility that they may be fined if they take their children out of school without permission.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Manchester homeless man's shock at Spice use in city,"In the space of a year, William Nicholson said he has noticed a marked rise in use of the formerly legal drug. Mr Nicholson, who spent six months in Manchester in 2016 before returning this May, said spice is now ""rife"" on the city's streets. He said: ""I was shocked when I came back, I didn't realise how bad it had got. ""There are people smoking it in broad daylight, in doorways, on park benches, everywhere you look. ""It's a real problem because it's so addictive and it's causing a lot of harm."" Spice is a synthetic cannabinoid that was first developed in the early 2000s. It is similar to cannabis in its effects, but it is much more potent. Spice has been linked to a number of health problems, including seizures, heart problems, and psychosis. It can also be fatal. In 2016, the UK government banned the sale and possession of spice. However, the drug is still widely available on the black market. Mr Nicholson said he has seen the devastating effects that spice can have on people. ""I've seen people who are addicted to spice and they're just not the same people anymore,"" he said. ""They're withdrawn, they're aggressive, and they're just not functioning properly. ""It's really sad to see."" Mr Nicholson said he is concerned that the use of spice is increasing in Manchester. ""I think it's because it's so cheap and easy to get,"" he said. ""It's also very addictive, so once people start using it, it's very difficult for them to stop. ""I'm worried that we're going to see more and more people dying from spice."" Mr Nicholson said he hopes that the government will take action to tackle the problem of spice use. ""I think the government needs to do more to educate people about the dangers of spice,"" he said. ""They also need to do more to crack down on the sale and supply of the drug. ""We need to do everything we can to stop people from dying from this terrible drug.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tyne and Wear Metro strike: Commuters and shoppers affected,"The network has been brought to a standstill after talks between operator Nexus and the RMT union broke down. Nexus has apologised to passengers and local bus companies. The strike, which began at 11pm on Monday, is over a pay dispute. The RMT is demanding a 7.1% pay increase, while Nexus has offered 2%. The strike is causing major disruption to commuters and shoppers. Many people are having to walk, cycle or drive to work or school. Local bus companies are also reporting a surge in demand. Nexus has said it is ""disappointed"" that the strike has gone ahead. It has urged the RMT to return to the negotiating table. However, the RMT has said it is ""determined"" to get a fair deal for its members. It has accused Nexus of ""failing to take the concerns of its workers seriously"". The strike is expected to last for three days. However, it could be extended if the two sides cannot reach an agreement. In the meantime, commuters and shoppers are advised to check the Nexus website for the latest information on services. They are also urged to consider alternative modes of transport. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial disputes that have hit the UK in recent months. Workers in various sectors, including rail, education and healthcare, have taken action over pay and conditions. The government has said it is ""concerned"" about the rising number of strikes. It has urged unions to work with employers to find a solution that is fair to both sides. However, unions have accused the government of failing to address the underlying issues that are causing the disputes. They have said that workers are simply trying to keep up with the rising cost of living. The strike is likely to cause further disruption to the UK economy. It is estimated that the rail strikes alone have cost the economy £1 billion. The government has said it is ""committed"" to supporting businesses that are affected by the strikes. However, it has also said that it will not tolerate ""unreasonable"" demands from unions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Virus rebuilds heart's own pacemaker in animal tests,"The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals and if these go awry the consequences can be fatal. In the heart, a small group of cells called the sinus node acts as the body's natural pacemaker, generating the electrical pulses that initiate each heartbeat. But if the sinus node becomes damaged, the heart's rhythm can become irregular and dangerously slow. Current treatments such as pacemakers rely on implanted devices to take over the role of the damaged sinus node. Now, scientists have developed a virus that appears to rebuild the body's own natural pacemaker in animal tests. The technique was developed by a team at the University of Utah and the results are published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The virus is a harmless adeno-associated virus, which has been genetically engineered so that it carries a gene that makes a key protein needed to generate electrical signals in the heart. When the virus is injected into the heart, it infects and modifies a small group of cells within the sinus node. These modified cells are then able to generate electrical signals, effectively rebuilding the heart's natural pacemaker. In animal tests, the technique led to a significant improvement in heart function in animals with damaged sinus nodes. The research is at an early stage and the team is now working on adapting it for use in humans. They are currently conducting a trial in patients with heart problems to assess the technique's safety and effectiveness. Dr Carlos Henrique, who carried out the research, said: ""This technique could potentially revolutionise the treatment of heart rhythm disorders. It could provide us with a way to restore normal heart function without the need for implanted devices."" Heart rhythm disorders - or arrhythmias - are a major global health problem. Irregular heart rhythms are caused by disruptions to the heart's normal electrical impulses. Arrhythmias affect one in four people in their lifetime. They can lead to a range of problems including dizziness, palpitations, breathlessness and tiredness. Some arrhythmias can also be fatal. Current treatments include medications, pacemakers and defibrillators. But these have a range of limitations and can lead to complications. The new technique could provide a more effective and less invasive treatment option for arrhythmias caused by damage to the sinus node.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Brexit: Differences remain over trade deal, say UK and EU","UK negotiator Lord David Frost said ""wide divergences"" remained in some areas, despite progress being made. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said there were ""serious divergences"" over fishing and competition rules. Negotiation resumed last week after a three-week break, but talks broke up at the weekend without agreement. Speaking after a meeting of EU ambassadors, Mr Barnier said the ""essential"" issue of fisheries and the ""crucial"" subject of ""governance"" - including rules on state aid and competition - remained unresolved. ""I regret the UK's position as it stands... It is not up to the task,"" he added. In a statement, Lord Frost said: ""We made progress in some areas but serious differences remain, particularly on fisheries and the so-called level playing field. Resolving these issues is essential for an agreement."" The UK government wants a deal that allows it to set its own rules, while the EU wants to ensure that the UK does not gain an unfair advantage over its member states. One EU diplomat said that the UK was demanding ""the best of both worlds"" - access to EU markets without following EU rules. ""This is not acceptable,"" the diplomat said. ""We are not going to give them a better deal than our own members."" The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains in a transition period until the end of the year. During this time, the UK abides by EU rules and regulations, but does not have a say in how they are made. If no trade deal is agreed by the end of the year, the UK will leave the EU's single market and customs union without a deal. This would mean that tariffs and other barriers to trade would be imposed between the UK and the EU. Many businesses have warned that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging to the UK economy. Lord Frost said the UK was ""prepared to leave without a deal at the end of the year"". ""But we continue to believe that it is possible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with the EU,"" he added.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Australia approves strikes against IS in Iraq,"Prime Minister Tony Abbott said IS was a ""death cult"" that had ""declared war on the world"" and must be stopped. IS controls a broad swathe of territory, spanning a borderless stretch of Syria and Iraq. The group, which is also known as ISIS, has led a campaign of abduction, rape and murder against civilians, and has become one of the biggest security threats to the West. Australia has already committed 600 personnel to the international coalition against IS, including 30 special forces soldiers who will train Iraqi army personnel in Iraq. The government has said it will not rule out sending combat troops to the region if necessary. The decision to approve air strikes was made after the government received a briefing from the chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley. General Hurley said the strikes would be carried out ""as part of the international coalition"", and that they would be ""precise and proportionate"". The government has said that the strikes will be targeted at IS headquarters, training camps and command centers. It has also said that the strikes will be carried out in accordance with international law. The decision to approve air strikes has been welcomed by the opposition Labor party. Labor leader Bill Shorten said that the strikes were ""necessary"" and that they would help to ""degrade"" IS. However, some critics have argued that the strikes will not be effective in stopping the spread of IS. They argue that IS is a highly mobile and adaptable group, and that it will be difficult to target its leaders and headquarters. Others have argued that the strikes could lead to civilian casualties. The government has said that it will take all possible measures to avoid civilian casualties, but there is no guarantee that this will be possible. The decision to approve air strikes is a significant escalation of Australia's involvement in the fight against IS. It is a sign that the government is increasingly concerned about the threat posed by the group, and that it is willing to take military action to stop it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Menzies Aviation workers face redundancy after global travel slump,"The Unite trade union said Menzies Aviation has started a 45-day consultation with staff. Before most aircraft were grounded, the company was one of those providing ground handling for aircraft and baggage. The firm said it had taken “all possible steps” to keep staff employed throughout the pandemic, including furloughing 90% of its workforce. However, it said it now needs to “restructure” its operations to survive the downturn in air travel. Unite regional officer Willie Thomson said: “This is devastating news for Menzies Aviation workers and their families, particularly at this time of year. “The aviation industry has been hit hard by the pandemic but it is also true that Menzies has been struggling financially for a number of years.” He said the union would be “doing everything we can” to support members during the consultation process and would be “pressing the company to do everything possible to avoid compulsory redundancies”. Menzies Aviation is a global aviation services company headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland. It provides ground handling, cargo handling, and fuelling services to airlines at more than 200 airports worldwide. The company has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a collapse in air travel. In September, Menzies Aviation announced plans to cut 400 jobs in the UK, citing the impact of the pandemic on its business. The company said the job cuts would affect all areas of its UK operations, including ground handling, cargo handling, and fuelling. The aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has estimated that the industry will lose $84 billion in revenue in 2020. The pandemic has led to a sharp decline in air travel, as people have been reluctant to fly due to concerns about the virus.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Challenge of Redcar blast furnace relighting,"Dave Johnson and Derek Thomas have between them more than 80 years' experience in the steel industry. Both spoke about the huge achievement of reopening the Redcar steelworks, which is now owned by SSI UK. ""It's a massive achievement to get this plant back up and running,"" said Johnson, who is the plant manager. ""It's a credit to the hard work and dedication of everyone involved."" Thomas, who is the operations manager, said that the restart of the blast furnace was a ""critical milestone"" for SSI UK. ""This is a major step forward for the company and for the Teesside area,"" he said. The Redcar steelworks was mothballed in 2015 after its previous owner, Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), went into liquidation. SSI UK bought the site out of administration in 2016 and has since invested heavily in restarting production. The blast furnace is the heart of the steelmaking process. It uses coke, iron ore and limestone to produce molten iron, which is then converted into steel. Restarting the blast furnace is a complex and time-consuming process. It took around three months to complete, and involved the work of hundreds of people. The first iron was produced from the blast furnace on 17 October 2022. This was a major milestone for SSI UK and for the Teesside area. The restart of the blast furnace has created hundreds of jobs and is a major boost for the local economy. It is also a sign of the growing confidence in the steel industry in the UK. However, the challenge is not over yet. SSI UK still needs to raise significant funding to complete the restart of the steelworks. The company is also facing challenges from the global steel market, which is currently in a downturn. Despite these challenges, Johnson and Thomas are confident about the future of SSI UK. They believe that the company has the potential to become a major player in the global steel industry. ""We have a great team of people and we have a great product,"" said Johnson. ""We are confident that we can make SSI UK a success.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Scots NHS staff to receive pay rise denied to English,"By Reevel Alderson BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Scots NHS staff are to receive a 1% pay rise backdated to April 2022, the Scottish government has announced. This is in contrast to England, where staff will not be given the 1% increase recommended by the NHS pay review body. The Scottish government said the pay rise was ""fair and affordable"" and that it recognized the contribution of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Royal College of Nursing in Scotland welcomed the pay rise, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the Scottish government had not gone further. ""This pay award is a welcome step in the right direction, but it is still a real-terms pay cut for our members,"" said Julie Lamberth, the RCN's director in Scotland. ""The Scottish government must now commit to a multi-year pay deal that will ensure that our members' pay keeps pace with inflation."" The Scottish government said the pay rise would cost £125m and would be funded from existing budgets. The announcement of the pay rise comes after months of negotiations between the Scottish government and trade unions. In England, the government has refused to implement the 1% pay rise recommended by the NHS pay review body. The government said it could not afford the pay rise and that it would have to be funded by cuts to services. The decision has been met with anger from trade unions, who have accused the government of breaking its promise to NHS staff. The Royal College of Nursing in England has said it will ballot its members for industrial action if the government does not agree to a pay rise. The pay dispute is the latest in a series of disputes between the government and public sector workers. In recent months, teachers, civil servants and railway workers have all taken strike action over pay and conditions. The government has said it is committed to keeping public sector pay down, but unions have argued that public sector workers are falling behind the cost of living. The pay dispute is likely to continue in the coming months, with unions warning of further industrial action if the government does not meet their demands.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

PC Gordon Semple death: Stefano Brizzi 'spent days' with body,"Stefano Brizzi, 50, is accused of strangling PC Gordon Semple, 59, and attempting to dispose of the remains in an acid bath. He told detectives he ""thought he was getting away with it"" when he spent days with the body before fleeing to Italy. Brizzi is said to have attacked the officer on April 1 following ""a brief discussion"" at his home in Southwark, south London. The pair were known to each other. The Old Bailey heard how Brizzi placed the officer's body in a large bag before keeping it in his living room for several days. Jurors were told he bought a number of items, including bleach, drain cleaner, and a new suitcase, which he planned to use to dispose of the body.

Undercover police: Legal challenge over inquiry,"Dominic Casciani Home affairs correspondent @BBCDomCon Twitter In a legal warning letter to the home secretary, they say one of the officers at the centre of the inquiry was responsible for their mother’s death. The lawyers acting for Jean Charles de Menezes’ family have sent a legal warning letter to the home secretary over a public inquiry into undercover policing. In a legal warning letter to the home secretary, they say one of the officers at the centre of the inquiry was responsible for their mother’s death. The inquiry, set up in 2014, is examining the use of undercover police officers to infiltrate political and social activist groups, and the way these officers have acted while undercover. Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead by police in 2005 after being mistaken for a suicide bomber. The police officer who shot him, known only as W40, was one of the undercover officers at the centre of the inquiry. The family’s lawyers say that W40 was responsible for the death of Jean Charles de Menezes and that the inquiry has failed to properly investigate his role. They are now calling for the inquiry to be halted and for a new one to be set up. The home secretary has said that she will not halt the inquiry, but she has agreed to meet with the family’s lawyers to discuss their concerns. The inquiry is due to report back to the home secretary by the end of 2023. The legal warning letter from the family’s lawyers is the latest in a series of challenges to the inquiry. Earlier this year, a group of campaigners launched a legal challenge to the inquiry’s terms of reference, arguing that they were too narrow. The campaigners’ challenge was unsuccessful, but the family’s lawyers hope that their warning letter will be more successful. The inquiry into undercover policing is one of the most important public inquiries in recent years. It is examining a serious issue that has raised questions about the role of the police and the way they operate. It is vital that the inquiry is able to conduct its work properly and that it is not subject to political or legal interference.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Libby Squire murder trial: Accused's behaviour 'frightening',"Libby Squire, 21, disappeared after she was refused entry to a Hull nightclub on 31 January 2019 and was found seven weeks later in the Humber Estuary.

Prosecutor Richard Wright QC has told Hull Crown Court how Relowicz, a Polish butcher, was ""determined that night to have sex with Libby, come what may"". Wright said Relowicz, who had drunk vodka and Jagerbombs before going out that night, had been ""casing"" women in the city centre, and had driven around in his van looking for a victim. He said Relowicz saw Ms Squire ""vulnerable"" and alone and decided to pursue her. He followed her in his van as she walked from the nightclub and through an alleyway.

Yemen's Houthis step back on threats to tax aid,"The rebel group, which has controlled the capital Sanaa and much of Yemen since 2014, had said they would impose a 2% tax on all aid entering the country, a move that would have had a devastating impact on the millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance. The Houthis' decision to back down on their threat came after intense international pressure, including from the United Nations and the United States. The UN envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said that the Houthis had ""agreed to reconsider"" their plans after he met with their leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. The US State Department also welcomed the Houthis' decision, saying that it was ""a positive step"" and that it would ""allow aid to continue to flow into Yemen."" The Houthis' decision to impose a tax on aid had been widely condemned by aid agencies, who said that it would have made it even more difficult to provide assistance to those in need. The UN estimates that 24 million Yemenis are in need of humanitarian assistance, and that 10 million are on the brink of famine. The Houthis have been accused of using aid as a weapon of war, and of diverting it to their own supporters. In 2018, the UN accused the Houthis of stealing food aid from warehouses and selling it on the black market. The Houthis have denied the allegations, but they have been accused of making it difficult for aid agencies to operate in Houthi-controlled areas. Aid agencies have said that they have been subjected to harassment and intimidation, and that they have been prevented from accessing some areas. The Houthis' decision to back down on their threat to tax aid is a welcome step, but it remains to be seen whether they will allow aid to flow into Yemen without hindrance. The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the worst in the world, and it is essential that all parties allow aid to reach those in need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Karate punching power 'all in the brain',"By Jonathan Ball BBC News In a close-range punching contest described in Cerebral Cortex, experts consistently out-hit novices. Scientists peered deep into the brains of the experts to reveal alterations in two regions related to balance and coordination - the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. They discovered that expert karateka have different patterns of activity in these regions compared with less experienced fighters. It's as if the expert brains have fine-tuned these areas for punching. The study also found that better-skilled fighters showed greater levels of connectivity between the two brain regions. ""I've been training now for 42 years and the movements are almost automatic,"" says Gary ""Tiger"" Mullins, a world champion karate fighter and one of the experts involved in the study. ""I can't think, 'I'm going to do this movement now' - I just do it, and I don't think about it. ""It's good to know what's happening in the brain. It's a bit like magic - you don't know how you do it."" ""Balance control is very important - when you're punching, you need to stay balanced,"" says Prof Etienne Sibille, one of the researchers on the study from the University of Strasbourg in France. ""These brain regions are really important for punching."" The scientists speculate that the changes they observed may have been caused by the act of training. Previous research has shown that the brain is able to adapt to the demands of training, for example by increasing the size of certain brain regions. ""When you train over a long period of time, you can change your brain,"" says Prof Sibille. ""So if you were a karate fighter, you could increase the volume of the cerebellum."" The researchers believe that their findings could help to improve training methods for karateka and other martial artists. ""We hope that this can lead to new ways of training - for example, we could devise exercises that target these specific brain regions,"" says Prof Sibille. ""It's a very exciting area of research and I think it's going to open up a lot of new possibilities in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Respite reported for Scotland's daily newspaper sales,"By Jamie McIvor BBC News correspondent The Scotsman and The Herald both recorded very small rises in their circulations between April and May. This was probably helped by the general election. However The Courier and The Press and Journal suffered falls in their circulation. The figures from the industry body Newsworks show a decline of 4.8% in Scotland's daily newspaper market over the past year, with an average sale of 460,318 copies per day. Sunday papers in Scotland saw larger circulation rises, but the increase of 8.9% was based on only 387,000 copies sold each day. It means total newspaper sales have fallen 4.7% over the past year with 847,318 papers being sold each day, down 41,426. On a UK basis, the Daily Mail saw a small circulation rise of 0.4% and is now the UK's biggest selling daily newspaper, ahead of The Sun. The Times, The Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, The Guardian and The Independent all saw falls in their circulation during May. Sunday newspaper sales were down 5.8% across the UK in May, with only the Mail on Sunday and The Sunday Times recording increases. The market for print newspapers has been in long-term decline, with readers increasingly getting their news online. The shift towards digital is a particular concern for regional newspapers, which rely more heavily on print sales than national titles. In Scotland, The Scotsman and The Herald have both launched digital subscription services in an attempt to boost revenue. The Courier and The Press and Journal have also been investing in digital, but they have not yet seen the same level of success as their rivals. The latest circulation figures from Newsworks show that newspapers are facing a tough battle to retain readers. The industry is hoping that the introduction of new technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, will help to attract new readers. However, it is clear that print newspapers will continue to face challenges in the coming years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Apple apologises and fixes security flaw,"Dave Lee North America technology reporter The flaw, revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. The latest version of macOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and apologize to all our customers, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the fact that it took us so long to correct it,"" Apple said in a statement. The security flaw was discovered by researcher Cedric Owens and responsibly disclosed to Apple. Owens said the bug could have been exploited in several scenarios, including phishing attacks. ""An attacker could have sent a malicious link to a victim, and once the victim clicked on the link, the attacker would have been able to gain full control of the victim's Mac,"" Owens said. ""This could have been used to steal sensitive data, install malware, or even take complete control of the victim's Mac."" The security update, which is available now, fixes the flaw and prevents attackers from exploiting it. Apple also recommends that users update their software to the latest version. This is not the first time that Apple has been criticized for its security practices. In 2018, the company was criticized for a security flaw that allowed attackers to access users' iCloud accounts without a password. Apple also came under fire in 2017 for a security flaw that allowed attackers to install malware on Macs without the user's knowledge. Apple has said that it is committed to improving its security practices. The company has hired more security engineers and has invested in new security technologies. However, the recent security flaw shows that Apple still has work to do. Apple's security flaws have raised concerns about the security of the company's products. Some experts have said that Apple's products are not as secure as they could be. Others have said that Apple is not doing enough to protect its users from cyberattacks. Apple has defended its security practices, saying that its products are among the most secure in the industry. The company has also said that it is constantly working to improve its security measures.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Corbyn aides warn against pre-election referendum,"By Iain Watson Political correspondent, BBC News These senior aides are concerned he is being pushed into a position which would delay a general election for some months by the shadow cabinet's Brexit policy spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer. A second referendum would effectively give the public a direct say on whether they want to leave the EU or not and would therefore change Labour's current policy. It would also open up the possibility of delays to the whole Brexit process because, if the public voted to remain, the government would have to extend its discussions with the EU. Mr Corbyn is facing calls to consider a second referendum on his own terms in order to unite the party but some of his closest allies are vehemently opposed to one. One senior aide told the BBC: ""A referendum would be a huge gamble for us and could open up big divisions in the party. ""Our main focus should be on winning the next election and we have to be careful not to get bogged down in Brexit, which is still a big problem for us."" The shadow cabinet will consider the proposal again on Tuesday, the BBC understands. Speaking at a rally in Harlow, Essex, Mr Corbyn said the referendum ""is an option on the table"". ""It's part of our policy-making process and we will take our time to reach a conclusion,"" he said. ""Our priority is to get a general election, to get a Labour government and to implement our manifesto. ""That means taking urgent action on the cost-of-living crisis, the housing crisis, the climate crisis and bringing our NHS back into public ownership."" Sir Keir has argued that a public vote is the only way to resolve the Brexit impasse. ""The country is deeply divided and many people are losing faith in our democracy,"" he said. ""A referendum would give the public a chance to have their say and would help to unite the country."" However, his proposal has been met with resistance from left-wing Labour MPs, who argue that it would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. They believe that a second referendum would only serve to prolong the Brexit process and would undermine public trust in democracy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away',"The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said huge pumps needed for the water mist system had arrived on site the day before. It was due to go live on 15 June - two weeks after the blaze started. However, there was not enough time to install it before the fire. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the water mist system would have been ""unlikely"" to prevent the huge fire that destroyed much of the art school building on 15 June 2018. Architects had hoped the system would extinguish any blaze within 15 minutes and stop it spreading. The £2m water mist system was part of a major refurbishment project at the art school. It included 243 sprinkler heads and five pumps - one of which was still on a lorry outside the building when the fire broke out. A source close to the project said the pumps had been delivered the day before and two were already in place in the basement. The remaining pumps were due to be installed in the coming weeks. The source said the sprinkler heads had been installed but the pumps were needed to power the system. ""Without the pumps, the system couldn't work,"" the source said. ""It was due to go live on 15 June."" The Glasgow School of Art fire was one of the biggest fires in the UK in recent years. It destroyed much of the art school's Mackintosh Building, which was designed by renowned architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The building is now being rebuilt and is expected to reopen in 2029. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was ""unprecedented"" and that the water mist system would have been ""unlikely"" to prevent it. ""The fire was so intense that it caused the roof to collapse and the building to be gutted,"" a spokesman said. ""It is difficult to say for certain what would have happened if the water mist system had been in place, but it is unlikely that it would have prevented the fire from spreading."" The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said the water mist system would have been ""a valuable addition"" to the art school's fire safety system. ""It is a very effective way of extinguishing fires and preventing them from spreading,"" a spokesman said. ""It is a shame that the system was not in place before the fire.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistanis respond after 'spy pigeon' detained in India,"BBC Trending What's popular and why It all started when a 14-year-old boy in an Indian village close to the border with Pakistan found a white pigeon with a mysterious ring attached to its foot. The Indian authorities were alerted, and the bird was soon labelled a ""spy pigeon"", leading to a diplomatic row between India and Pakistan. However, Pakistanis have taken to social media to respond to the incident with a mixture of humour and anger. Some have suggested that the pigeon may have been sent by Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, to gather information about India's military installations. Others have joked that the pigeon was a peace envoy, or even a ""freedom fighter"". However, many Pakistanis have also expressed anger at the Indian authorities for detaining the pigeon and accusing it of being a spy. They argue that the bird is an innocent creature that should not be used as a political pawn. ""#FreeThePigeon"" has become a trending hashtag on Twitter in Pakistan, with many users calling for the bird to be released immediately. One user tweeted: ""This is a travesty of justice. The pigeon has done nothing wrong and should not be held captive."" Another user wrote: ""The Indian government is making a mockery of itself with this stunt. It's time to let the pigeon go."" The incident has also been met with amusement by some Pakistanis. One user tweeted: ""I can't believe India is accusing us of sending spy pigeons. This is the funniest thing I've heard all week."" Another user wrote: ""I wonder what kind of secrets the Indian government thinks the pigeon was carrying. Maybe it was carrying a message from our prime minister to the Indian president?"" The Indian authorities have not yet commented on the incident, but it is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. This is not the first time that pigeons have been accused of being spies. In 2018, a pigeon with a camera attached to its back was found in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian authorities claimed that the pigeon was being used to spy on Indian military installations, but Pakistan denied the allegations, saying that the bird was a pet. The use of pigeons as spies is a centuries-old practice. In ancient times, pigeons were used to carry messages between armies. In more recent times, pigeons have been used to spy on enemy territory during wartime. However, the use of pigeons as spies is becoming increasingly rare as technology advances. Today, there are more effective and less risky ways to gather intelligence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
A US judge asked lawyers to explain the lyrics to Thriller,"US Tax Court Judge Mark Holmes had always been puzzled by the rap at the end of Michael Jackson's Thriller, so when the star's former lawyer John Branca appeared in front of him, he decided to ask him for an explanation. Branca, who also happens to be the co-executor of Jackson's estate, duly obliged, giving a detailed breakdown of the lyrics. The rap, performed by Vincent Price, is a spoken-word monologue that serves as a chilling epilogue to the song's eerie narrative. It begins with the line, ""Darkness falls across the land,"" and goes on to describe a group of ghouls and monsters emerging from their graves. Price's sinister delivery adds to the sense of dread, as he warns the listener, ""Thriller night is here."" Branca explained to Judge Holmes that the rap was Jackson's way of paying homage to the horror films of his youth. ""Michael was a big fan of Vincent Price and horror movies in general,"" Branca said. ""He wanted to create a song that would be both scary and fun, and he thought that Price's voice would be the perfect addition."" The rap also contains a number of references to classic horror films, such as ""Boris Karloff"" (the actor who played Frankenstein's monster) and ""your local drive-in."" These references serve to further enhance the song's creepy atmosphere. Judge Holmes was clearly fascinated by Branca's explanation, and he thanked the lawyer for his time. ""I've always been a fan of Thriller,"" Holmes said, ""but I never really understood the rap at the end. Now I do, and I appreciate it even more."" Branca's explanation is a reminder of the importance of context when it comes to interpreting art. The rap at the end of Thriller may seem like a strange and out-of-place addition to the song, but when you understand the references and the inspiration behind it, it becomes clear that it is an integral part of the song's overall impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Belfast homeless: At least five dead since January, says charity","By Andy West BBC News NI There are no specific statistics on those who die during or after a period of homelessness. However, the Welcome Organisation said rough sleepers are dying due to mental and physical illness, as well as suicides and accidents as a result of their situation. Patrick Corrigan, the Welcome Organisation's chief executive said: ""We have been working in the city centre for 30 years and we are seeing more people dying on the streets."" ""What we are seeing now is people who are much younger and that is a real cause for concern, in the past it was people who may have had a dependency on alcohol and maybe in their 40s or 50s might pass away, now we are seeing people in their 20s and 30s."" He said funding cuts were having an impact on the health and welfare of homeless people. ""We don't have the funding to help the people who need our help the most, something has to change,"" he said. The Welcome Organisation runs two centres in Belfast that provide day services to homeless people and those at risk of homelessness. In a statement, the Department for Communities said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths of homeless people. ""We are committed to tackling homelessness and providing support to those who need it most,"" the statement said. ""We are investing over £100m in homelessness services this year, including funding for outreach and support services for those living on the streets."" The department said it was working with the Welcome Organisation and other partners to improve services for homeless people, including those with complex needs such as mental health issues and addiction. The department also said it was working to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place, including providing financial assistance and support to those at risk of losing their homes. SDLP councillor Paul McCusker said the deaths of homeless people were a ""tragedy"". ""These are people who are dying on our streets, in our city centre, and it is a disgrace,"" he said. ""We need to see more funding for homeless services, and we need to see more support for people who are struggling with mental health issues and addiction.""

Tube passengers forced to walk off train in Underground,"Commuters endured another day of misery when services were delayed, disrupted or cancelled on parts of the network. London Underground apologised for the disruption, saying it was due to a ""combination of factors"", including signal failures and staff shortages. On the Piccadilly line, eastbound trains were not stopping at Hyde Park Corner or Green Park due to a signal failure at Hyde Park Corner. This caused severe delays to services between Heathrow and Cockfosters. On the Northern line, there were no trains between High Barnet and Camden Town due to a track fault at Golders Green. This caused major disruption to services between Edgware and Morden. On the Victoria line, there were no trains between Brixton and Victoria due to a signal failure at Victoria. This caused severe delays to services between Brixton and Walthamstow Central. On the Jubilee line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Green Park. On the Metropolitan line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Baker Street. On the Hammersmith & City line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Hammersmith. On the District line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Ealing Broadway. On the Overground, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Gospel Oak. London Underground apologised for the disruption and advised commuters to check before they travel. The disruption came as London Underground is facing a number of challenges, including staff shortages and a lack of investment. The union representing Tube workers, the RMT, has said that the disruption is a result of years of underinvestment in the network. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said that he is committed to investing in the Tube and making it a more reliable service. However, he has also said that he needs the government to provide more funding. The government has said that it is committed to working with the Mayor of London to improve the Tube. However, it has also said that it cannot provide more funding at this time. The disruption on the Tube is likely to continue for some time.

Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors',"By James Gallagher Health and science reporter, BBC News website The Stanford University team said the findings were ""incredibly exciting"" and would now be tested in clinics. Eventually, they hope AI will help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and personalize treatments. However, they stress the technology is still in its early stages and is not ready to replace doctors. Instead, they will help doctors in the same way a calculator helps an accountant. The AI system is trained on a vast dataset of mammograms and corresponding patient outcomes. This includes images where cancer has been detected and where it has not. The system learns to identify patterns in the mammograms that are invisible to the human eye, and it uses these to make its predictions. In the study, the researchers trained their AI on a dataset of more than 28,000 mammograms and tested it on a separate dataset of almost 2,000 mammograms. They found that the AI system was as good as a human radiologist at detecting cancer, but it was better at identifying benign lumps. The researchers say their system could assist radiologists by providing a second opinion or by highlighting suspicious areas on mammograms for further examination. Dr Michael Abramoff, who led the research, said: ""Our AI has achieved a level of accuracy that is comparable to the best human radiologists. This is a major milestone in the development of AI for healthcare."" However, he cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages. ""AI is not a replacement for doctors. It is a tool that can help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and personalize treatments,"" he said. The next step is to test the AI system in a clinical setting. The researchers are planning to launch a trial in the US later this year. If the trial is successful, the AI system could be used in clinics within the next few years. The research is published in the journal Nature Medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be as good as cancer doctors at detecting breast cancer on mammograms, a new study has found. The researchers, from Stanford University in the US, say their findings are ""incredibly exciting"" and could lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments for patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Egypt court quashes Red Sea islands' transfer to Saudis,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with the transfer, including activists, journalists, and lawyers who protested against the deal.  The transfer was widely criticized by many Egyptians, who saw it as a betrayal of national sovereignty and a violation of the country's constitution, which states that Egyptian territory cannot be ceded without the approval of parliament.  Despite the public outcry, the government claimed that the transfer was necessary to protect Egypt's security interests and to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia. However, many Egyptians remained skeptical of the government's motives, believing that the transfer was primarily motivated by financial considerations and a desire to gain favor with the Saudi royal family.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia has been a controversial issue in Egypt since it was first announced in April 2016. The deal has been met with widespread opposition from many Egyptians, who believe that the islands are an integral part of Egyptian territory and should not be ceded to another country.  The government has defended the deal, saying that it is necessary to protect Egypt's security interests and to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia. However, many Egyptians remain skeptical of the government's motives, believing that the transfer is primarily motivated by financial considerations and a desire to gain favor with the Saudi royal family.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir has also raised concerns about the future of other Egyptian islands in the Red Sea. Some Egyptians fear that the government may be willing to cede other islands to Saudi Arabia or other countries in the future in exchange for financial or political gain.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir is a complex issue with no easy answers. It is a matter of national sovereignty, security, and economics. The Egyptian government must weigh all of these factors carefully in making decisions about the future of Egypt's islands in the Red Sea.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools,"Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools By Robbie Meredith BBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Education (DE) revealed the figure to the Stormont Education Committee on Tuesday. Up until that point, the department had only confirmed cases in 62 schools. The DE said it is not releasing the names of schools with confirmed cases for data protection reasons and to avoid creating unnecessary stigma. The new school term began on 31 August. There are nearly 1,200 schools in Northern Ireland, catering for more than 350,000 pupils. The latest figures come as teachers' unions warned of an ""explosion"" in Covid-19 cases in schools. The National Education Union (NEU) said the number of confirmed cases will not give the full picture as schools are not expected to report cases to the Public Health Agency (PHA) unless they reach a certain threshold. NEU joint secretary Gerry Murphy said schools that are not reporting cases to the PHA have pupils who are positive and ""they are becoming super spreaders"" due to ""the lack of mitigations in place"". ""This is a really serious situation,"" he said. ""We want to see schools open but they need to be safe environments for all concerned."" The INTO teaching union said it had received ""many calls"" from teachers and principals asking what they should do if they have a positive case in their school. John Boyle, the union's general secretary for Northern Ireland, said that in some schools full classes of pupils have been sent home due to one positive case, while other schools have been advised that pupils do not need to go home as long as they wear face coverings. ""That is not acceptable,"" he said. ""Schools need urgent clarification from the Department of Education and the Public Health Agency on how to deal with confirmed cases and what mitigations need to be in place to maintain a safe learning environment."" The Public Health Agency (PHA) said it was ""very concerned"" about the increase in the number of cases in schools. The PHA's head of health protection Dr Gerry Waldron said it was ""important to remember that while children and young people are less likely to become seriously ill from Covid-19, they can still transmit the virus to others"". ""We are urging everyone to take steps to reduce the risk of transmission, including getting vaccinated, wearing face coverings in crowded indoor settings, and washing your hands regularly,"" he said. The Department of Education said it was ""fully aware"" of the concerns raised by the teaching unions.

""We will continue to monitor the situation and take any necessary steps to ensure that schools remain safe environments for pupils and staff,"" the spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Drones hamper US firefighting efforts,"Lives were put at unnecessary risk because helicopters could not fly, said fire department officials. The helicopters were helping to contain a large wildfire in San Bernadino county over the weekend. Five drones spotted hovering over the fire were thought to belong to members of the public who had flown them into the area to take pictures or videos. Repeated attempts to contact the drone operators and tell them to move their aircraft failed, said fire officials. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is responsible for regulating all airspace, was also unable to make contact. As a result, the helicopters were grounded for safety reasons. Without the aerial support, the firefighters on the ground had to work harder to bring the fire under control. The fire eventually spread to cover more than 1,000 acres. The use of drones is becoming increasingly common, and while they can be a useful tool for taking aerial photographs and videos, they can also pose a serious safety risk to aircraft. In this case, the drones prevented the helicopters from doing their job and put lives at risk. The FAA has strict rules about flying drones in the vicinity of wildfires. These rules are in place to protect the safety of firefighters and other aircraft. If you are planning to fly a drone near a wildfire, please be sure to check the FAA's website for the latest regulations. In addition to the safety risks, flying drones near wildfires can also interfere with firefighting efforts. The drones can create a distraction for pilots and can also damage equipment. If you see a drone flying near a wildfire, please report it to the authorities immediately. The FAA is working to develop new technologies that will make it easier to identify and track drones. The agency is also working to educate the public about the dangers of flying drones near wildfires. In the meantime, it is important to be aware of the risks and to follow the FAA's regulations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Putin critic Bill Browder freed after brief arrest in Spain,"After an hour in custody he was released because the warrant was no longer valid, Spanish police said. Mr Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. Interpol rejected the claim, saying: ""There is no active Red Notice or diffusion against William Browder in Interpol's databases."" Mr Browder is a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has campaigned for sanctions against Russia. He is the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, an investment fund that was once one of the largest foreign investors in Russia. In 2005, Mr Browder's lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and died in a Russian prison in 2009 after being allegedly tortured and denied medical care. Mr Browder has accused Russian officials of murdering Magnitsky and has campaigned for justice for his death. The Russian authorities have accused Mr Browder of tax evasion and other financial crimes. He has denied the allegations and has said that they are politically motivated. Mr Browder's arrest in Spain comes at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West. The UK has accused Russia of trying to interfere in its politics, and the US has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Russian government has denied interfering in the UK's politics and has said that the sanctions against it are unjustified. Mr Browder's arrest is likely to further strain relations between Russia and the West. It is unclear whether the arrest was politically motivated, but it is clear that Mr Browder is a thorn in the side of the Russian government.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Bird family tree shaken by discovery of feathered fossil,"By Helen Briggs BBC News The turacos, or banana-eaters, are today found only in Africa, living in forests and savannah. They are brightly coloured birds with distinctive red flight feathers and green or blue bodies. A beautifully preserved fossil bird from 52 million years ago is shaking up the family tree of turacos and other highly charismatic and colourful birds including parrots, the businesslike hoatzins, and the ground-dwelling curassows. The newly discovered species, named Primobucco jaguaribensis, not only belongs to the turaco family, but is also a direct ancestor of all parrots and their relatives. The fossil, found in Brazil, suggests that the ancestor of today's turacos and the ancestor of parrots were one and the same. Dr Borja Figueirido, lead author on the paper in Nature, from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told BBC News: ""We were expecting to find the fossil of a parrot or a hoatzin relative because that's what we have in the Palaeocene in Brazil. But it looked more like a turaco."" The fossil bird was the size of a pigeon, with a long tail, short wings and remarkably long toes. When the team ""dissected"" its foot bones to see which muscles attached where, they found that it walked like a turaco, too. ""This bird pretty much had the same foot morphology as modern turacos. This is quite astonishing,"" Dr Figueirido said. It was not an easy fossil to study. The specimen is squashed flat, so its skull is difficult to see. Its back was also missing, having fallen off the slab. DNA from the fossil itself could not be recovered. So, the team compared its DNA sequence with that of all living turacos, parrots and hoatzins to place it on their family tree. The researchers found that the DNA of the fossil was a mix of turaco and parrot, proving that the fossil was a missing link between the two families. ""We were surprised to find that the fossil was not only a turaco but also the direct ancestor of all parrots and their relatives,"" Dr Figueirido said. ""It shows that the diversification of parrots and other colourful birds occurred much earlier than we previously thought."" Many scientists had thought that parrots evolved in Australia, because of the high diversity of species found there today. But the new fossil find in Brazil adds weight to the idea that the turaco/parrot ancestor originated in South America and then spread to other continents, possibly flying across the Atlantic Ocean. The fossil bird Protoavis, from about 66 million years ago, is often considered to be the ancestor of all modern birds. It also had long legs and a long tail, not unlike Primobucco jaguaribensis. ""Having two fossils that are so old and show long legs and long tails suggests that this might be a plesiomorphic character - a primitive characteristic that's inherited from the last common ancestor of all modern birds,"" Dr Figueirido said. ""If this is true, then the short-legged, short-tailed birds like chickens, ducks and eagles evolved from long-legged, long-tailed ancestors.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Liposuction rise linked to gym wear trend,"Rajiv Grover, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says latest UK data shows procedures have gone up 12% in a year, from 44,000 to 49,000. The increase has been linked to the ""athleisure"" fashion trend, which has seen gym wear become more popular as everyday clothing. This trend has made it more acceptable to show off the body, which in turn has led to increased demand for cosmetic procedures such as liposuction. Grover says: ""There's no doubt that the athleisure trend has had a significant impact on the popularity of liposuction. In the past, people were more likely to cover up their bodies, but now they're more comfortable showing them off. This has led to a greater desire to have a body that looks toned and athletic."" However, Grover warns that liposuction is not a quick fix for weight loss. ""Liposuction is a surgical procedure that removes fat from specific areas of the body. It's not a weight-loss solution, and it's not a substitute for a healthy diet and exercise,"" he says. ""If you're considering liposuction, it's important to do your research and find a reputable surgeon who can help you achieve your desired results."" Dr. David Jack, a consultant plastic surgeon at the London Clinic, agrees that the athleisure trend has played a role in the rise of liposuction. He says: ""I've definitely seen an increase in the number of patients coming to me for liposuction in recent years. I think this is partly due to the fact that people are more likely to wear gym clothes outside of the gym, which has made them more comfortable with the idea of showing off their bodies."" However, Jack also stresses that liposuction is not a magic bullet. ""It's important to have realistic expectations about what liposuction can achieve. It can't give you a perfect body, and it's not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle,"" he says. ""If you're considering liposuction, it's important to do your research and find a reputable surgeon who can help you achieve your desired results. You should also be aware of the risks and complications associated with the procedure.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
City sanguine on snap election call,"Simon Jack Business editor The pound has gained 1% and although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May called a snap election for 8 June. Still, market watchers are taking a keen interest in the moves because markets are likely to reward the greatest certainty. Currency traders, for example, like to know what sort of government will be in power, what economic direction it will travel in and what sort of trade deals it will seek. The pound has been particularly sensitive to Brexit, a vote to leave the EU, as many investors think a departure will shrink the economy and damage the country's international standing. Sterling fell more than 10% after the Brexit vote and has been fluctuating ever since. It is trading at $1.29, having risen from a low of $1.21 after the Brexit vote. The FTSE 100, the main index of blue-chip shares in London, has drifted in recent months, and has been dragged lower by weaker commodity prices, which have hit mining and oil stocks particularly hard. The FTSE 100 is trading at 7,350, having risen from a low of 6,850 after the Brexit vote. Investors like Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of fund manager GMO, are expecting the stock market to continue to fall. Last week, he said that the US stock market, and the FTSE 100, were ""very dubiously placed"". He warned that central banks will need to raise interest rates in the next few years, which will take the wind out of the sails of the recovery in the stock market. He said: ""I don't think a recession is imminent, but I do think it is close."" However, most economists expect the UK economy to continue to grow this year, although at a slower pace than in recent years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts growth of 1.7% in the UK this year and 1.4% in 2018, compared with 2.2% in 2016. The markets expect a Conservative win because it is seen as the most stable outcome. The Conservatives are ahead in the polls and are likely to win the most seats. However, the pound and the stock market could still fall if the Conservatives fail to win a majority and have to form a coalition government with another party, such as the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National Party. A hung parliament could also lead to a second referendum on Brexit, which would create further uncertainty and could damage the economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Foals: Oxford band go from squat parties to Albert Hall,"By Greg Cochrane Newsbeat music reporter ""There were two things we didn't want to do,"" recalls frontman Yannis Philappakis. ""One was not do a record which was exactly like [2008's] Antidotes. The other was not to do one which was exactly the opposite. ""We knew our sound had to evolve but we also didn't want to alienate the fans we had gained with Antidotes."" Mission accomplished. Released in October 2010, Total Life Forever was a more polished, poppy and experimental affair than its predecessor, but it retained enough of Foals' raw energy and math-rock nous to please their existing fans. Total Life Forever debuted at number eight in the UK charts, and the band spent the next 18 months touring it relentlessly. By the time they got back from their final American date in October 2011, they had a dilemma. ""We needed time off,"" says Philappakis. ""We were totally burned out."" So they took a break and went their separate ways. Philappakis went to study in Los Angeles, keyboardist Edwin Congreave moved to London, drummer Jack Bevan travelled Europe and guitarist Jimmy Smith stayed in Oxford. ""I think it was really healthy for us,"" says Philappakis. ""We'd been going non-stop for so long. We all needed a bit of space to do our own thing."" A year later, they reconvened in Oxford to start work on their third album. ""We went into it with a very different frame of mind,"" says Philappakis. ""We weren't trying to write the next Antidotes or the next Total Life Forever. We just wanted to make a record that reflected where we were at that point in time."" The result was Holy Fire, released in November 2013. It was a more mature and introspective record than its predecessors, but it still had plenty of the energy and excitement that had made Foals one of the most exciting bands in British rock. Holy Fire debuted at number two in the UK charts and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The band toured it extensively throughout 2014, including a sold-out show at London's Alexandra Palace. In 2015, Foals released their fourth album, What Went Down. It was their most experimental and ambitious record to date, and it divided opinion among critics. Some praised it as a bold and innovative work, while others accused the band of losing their way. Despite the mixed reviews, What Went Down debuted at number one in the UK charts and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The band toured it extensively throughout 2016, including a headline slot at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In 2017, Foals released their fifth album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost - Part 1. It was a more experimental affair than its predecessor, and it incorporated elements of electronica and R&B. The album was met with critical acclaim, and it debuted at number two in the UK charts. The band toured it extensively throughout 2018, including a headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival. In 2019, Foals released the second part of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost. It was a more traditional rock record than its predecessor, and it was met with positive reviews from critics. The album debuted at number one in the UK charts, and the band toured it extensively throughout 2019 and 2020. In 2022, Foals released their seventh album, Life Is Yours. It was a more upbeat and optimistic record than its predecessors and it was met with critical acclaim. The album debuted at number one in the UK charts, and the band toured it extensively throughout 2022 and 2023.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows,"Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor HMD Odyssey joins previously announced VR headsets and hand controllers from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer and Asus to form the launch hardware line-up for Microsoft's new Mixed Reality. The Odyssey headset has high-resolution displays with a combined resolution of 3,664 x 1,920 pixels, the widest field of view of any Windows Mixed Reality headset - 110 degrees - and integrated AKG headphones with spatial audio. Samsung says it is also the lightest VR headset on the market at 645g. The wide field of view was described as ""mind-blowing"" by UK technology journalist Gareth Beavis, who tried out the Odyssey at Samsung's launch event in San Francisco. ""It was like I was in a different world,"" he told the BBC. ""The resolution and quality was fantastic. This was a stunning step up from existing VR headsets."" Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform will let people use VR to watch 360-degree videos, play games, and explore virtual worlds. It will also contain features derived from the company's augmented reality headset, HoloLens. These will allow the user's real-world environment to be shown in the headset's display alongside virtual objects. The hardware will start from $499 and will include the headset, two motion controllers and a six-degrees of freedom sensor. The latter will enable smooth navigation around the virtual environment. As well as wired versions, there will also be a wireless version that can be used together with Windows 10 PCs that feature Intel's Wi-Fi Gigabit technology. The devices will go on sale on 17 October, and apps will be available via Microsoft's new Windows Store. AI-powered avatars Microsoft has also announced a software update to the Windows 10 operating system. The update will allow apps to make use of the Mixed Reality headsets via Windows Store APIs. Mixed Reality will also be supported on Xbox One from early 2018, although the Xbox One console will not be powerful enough to drive the best VR visuals. Microsoft has also unveiled a new feature for its Mixed Reality platform called Mixed Reality Capture Studios. This platform will allow people to create and share virtual experiences with others, even those who do not have a Mixed Reality headset. It will use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate ""avatars"" of the users and their environments. These avatars will allow people to interact with each other in virtual reality, creating new possibilities for socialising, entertainment and education.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Poet Philip Gross wins Wales Book of the Year,"Philip Gross's I Spy Pinhole Eye was one of the three shortlisted works for the £10,000 prize. It is the Penarth poet's second major award in a year - a different collection of his, The Water Table, won the Forward Poetry Prize last autumn. The announcement was made on S4C as part of Wales Book of the Year 2020, presented by Welsh actor Siân Phillips and author and broadcaster Damian Walford Davies. Gross was praised for his ""dexterity, intelligence and imagination"" by judges Jason Walford Davies, Dr Mererid Hopwood and Professor Dai Smith. I Spy Pinhole Eye was described as ""a love poem to Wales"" exploring ""the politics and mythologies of language"". Reflecting on the inspiration behind the poems, Gross said: ""I've been living in Wales for over 40 years and I'm interested in the relationship between the Welsh and English language here. ""I'm intrigued by the power of words and the different ways words can be used. I wanted to create a collection of poems that explored that relationship."" Gross, who is a professor of creative writing at Glamorgan University, added: ""Winning the Wales Book of the Year award is a real honour. I always feel a bit nervous when I submit my work for awards, because you just don't know what the judges are going to think. ""But I'm really pleased that they responded to my work in such a positive way. It's a great feeling to know that my work is being appreciated."" The other shortlisted authors were: Cynan Jones for his novel The Dig Gwen Davies for her volume of poetry Lliwiau Llafar (Speaking Colours).

National Farmers' Union condemns flooding plans,"Engineers have proposed creating ponds and bogs on high ground to prevent rainfall rushing down hills and causing flooding. However, NFU president Peter Kendall said farmland was ""far too valuable"". He said: ""We have a finite resource of land in this country that is available for food production. We cannot afford to lose any of it to flooding or any other unproductive use. ""We believe that there are better ways to manage water on high ground, such as through the use of sustainable drainage systems and planting trees. These methods are more cost-effective and do not damage valuable farmland."" The Environment Agency has said that it is committed to working with farmers to find solutions to flooding that do not damage their livelihoods. A spokesman said: ""We understand that farmers have concerns about losing land to flooding, but we believe that the proposed measures are necessary to protect communities from flooding. ""We are committed to working with farmers to find solutions that are acceptable to them and that do not damage their livelihoods."" The government has said that it is committed to protecting farmland from flooding. A spokesman said: ""We recognize that farmland is a valuable asset and we are committed to protecting it from flooding.

Welsh Conservative leader contender Paul Davies 'not grey',"By Aled ap Dafydd BBC Wales political correspondent The interim leader of the Tory assembly group has been described by a party insider as a ""man in a beige suit"". The Preseli Pembrokeshire AM Paul Davies is seen as the frontrunner of the four-person race to become the next leader of the Welsh Conservatives. But who is Paul Davies, and what are his chances of leading the Welsh Tories to victory at the next Senedd election? Born in Surrey to a Welsh father and an English mother, Davies was raised in a Welsh-speaking home in Prestatyn. He was educated at Ysgol Glan Clwyd before going on to study at the University of Wolverhampton, where he obtained a degree in accountancy and law. After graduating, Davies worked as a chartered accountant before being elected to the National Assembly for Wales in 2011. He served as a shadow minister under Andrew RT Davies and was appointed interim leader of the Welsh Conservative group in the Senedd following the latter's decision to stand down in June 2021. Described by one party insider as a ""safe pair of hands"", Davies is seen as a moderate, pragmatic politician. He is not afraid to speak his mind, but he is also a team player and is well-respected by his colleagues. Davies's main rivals in the leadership race are believed to be Jane Dodds, Darren Millar, and Nick Ramsay. Dodds is the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the only non-Conservative candidate in the race. Millar is the AM for Clwyd West and has served in the Welsh Government as Minister for Health and Social Services. Ramsay is the AM for Monmouth and has served as Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology. Davies is the favorite to win the leadership race, but he will need to unite the party behind him if he is to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election. The Tories are currently the third-largest party in the Senedd, behind Labour and Plaid Cymru. If Davies is elected leader, he will be the first Welsh-speaker to lead the Welsh Conservatives since Nicholas Edwards in the 1990s. He will also be the first leader of the Welsh Conservatives to have been born in England. Davies's supporters say that he is the right person to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election. They point to his experience in government and his ability to unite people from different backgrounds. His critics say that he is too close to the Welsh Government and that he lacks the charisma and vision to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory. Only time will tell whether Paul Davies has what it takes to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Iceland mayors object to Google snow,"By News from Elsewhere...as found by BBC Monitoring Jón Páll Hreinsson says this could put overseas tourists off visiting Bolungarvík in northwest Iceland. The mayor of Sweden's reindeer capital is worried about the effects of climate change on the local economy. ""If the snow goes, the whole area will become a sad place,"" says Jörgen Jönsson of Jokkmokk. ""The snow is what makes this area what it is,"" he adds, ""and it's what attracts tourists to visit."" Jokkmokk is famous for its annual Winter Market, where reindeer herders display and trade their wares. But if the snow melts away, the herders will no longer be able to transport their animals and goods to the town. ""The reindeer travel on the ice roads. We can't use those in the summer,"" says Jönsson. ""So if we don't have snow, we don't have reindeer."" The melting snow is also a threat to Jokkmokk's tourist industry. Last year, the town attracted more than 100,000 visitors. But if the snow disappears, the number of tourists is likely to drop. ""People see the snow and think of Sweden,"" says Jönsson. ""If we don't have that, they won't come."" In Iceland, the mayor of a small fishing town is also concerned about the effects of climate change. Jón Páll Hreinsson says the snow is important for attracting tourists to Bolungarvík in northwest Iceland. ""Overseas tourists like to see snow,"" says Hreinsson. ""They might not come here if it's not snowy."" Bolungarvík is a popular destination for tourists who want to see the Northern Lights. But if the snow melts away, the Lights will be harder to see. ""The snow reflects the light,"" says Hreinsson. ""So if there's no snow, the Lights won't be as bright."" Hreinsson says the town council is looking at ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. One idea is to use artificial snow to cover the town's streets. But Hreinsson admits that this is only a temporary solution. ""We need to do something more than just cover the snow,"" he says. ""We need to find a way to stop the snow from melting in the first place.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

'Law change needed' to stop sale of 'legal highs',"The Local Government Association (LGA) - which represents 400 councils - wants the government to adopt a similar approach to that taken in Ireland. Instead of banning drugs on a case-by-case basis, Ireland has banned all ""psychoactive"" - brain altering - substances. Under this law, if a substance has not been specifically approved for human consumption, it can't be sold or possessed. This approach has been successful in significantly reducing the availability of legal highs in Ireland. In 2010, there were 233 reported cases of people being treated for taking legal highs in Ireland. By 2016, that number had fallen to just 39. The LGA believes that a blanket ban on psychoactive substances is the best way to protect people from the dangers of legal highs. A spokesperson for the LGA said: ""We believe that a blanket ban on new psychoactive substances is the most effective way to protect people from the dangers of these drugs. ""Legal highs are often marketed as safe alternatives to illegal drugs, but they can be just as dangerous. They can cause a range of side effects, including psychosis, seizures, and even death."" The government has said that it is considering a blanket ban on legal highs. However, it has also said that it wants to avoid criminalising people who use these drugs. The LGA's call for a blanket ban is supported by some experts. Professor David Nutt, a former government drug advisor, said: ""A blanket ban would be the most effective way to protect people from these drugs. ""It would remove the incentive for people to develop new legal highs, and it would make it much harder for people to access these drugs."" However, other experts have warned that a blanket ban could have negative consequences. Dr Catherine Curran, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Huddersfield, said: ""A blanket ban could lead to people using more dangerous illegal drugs. ""It could also lead to people buying legal highs on the black market, where they may be more likely to be sold counterfeit or adulterated drugs."" The government is expected to make a decision on whether to introduce a blanket ban on legal highs in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jeff Koons' Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist,"Christie's in New York sold Rabbit, a 41in (104cm) steel cast of an inflatable created in 1986, for more than $20m over its estimated price. It beats the previous record set by British artist David Hockney's 1972 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which sold for $90.3m at Christie's in November 2018. Rabbit is part of a series of sculptures by Koons that feature everyday objects rendered in monumental scale. The series, which also includes Balloon Dog and Flower Puppy, is intended to challenge traditional notions of art and to explore the relationship between popular culture and high art. Rabbit is considered one of Koons's most iconic works, and its sale for a record-breaking price is a testament to his enduring popularity and influence. The sale of Rabbit also highlights the growing demand for contemporary art by major collectors. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-profile auctions of contemporary art, and prices have been steadily rising. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, as more and more collectors seek to acquire works by established and emerging contemporary artists. Koons, who was born in York, Pennsylvania, in 1954, is one of the most successful and controversial artists of his generation. He began his career in the 1980s, and his work has since been exhibited in major museums around the world. Koons is known for his use of kitsch and popular culture imagery, and his work has often been criticized for being superficial and lacking in originality. However, Koons's defenders argue that his work is a clever and ironic commentary on the commodification of art and the culture of celebrity. The sale of Rabbit for a record-breaking price is a major milestone in Koons's career. It is a testament to his enduring popularity and influence, and it is likely to further increase the demand for his work in the years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid: Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix called off for second year,"The events were due to be held from 22 August until 3 September. The news follows the announcement on Monday that the island's borders would remain closed to visitors until at least 28 June. Rob Callister, the island's political member with responsibility for tourism and motorsport, said the decision had been made ""with a heavy heart"". ""It is with a heavy heart that we have had to make the difficult decision to cancel the 2021 Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix,"" he said. ""We know how much these events mean to our visitors, competitors, and the island as a whole, but the safety of everyone involved must come first."" The Classic TT is open to riders on classic motorcycles, while the Manx Grand Prix is for amateur riders. Both events are held on the Isle of Man's 37.73-mile (60.72km) Mountain Course, which is considered one of the most challenging circuits in the world. The Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix were canceled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Isle of Man has been relatively successful in controlling the virus, with just over 300 cases and four deaths recorded since the start of the pandemic. However, the island's government has been cautious about reopening its borders, amid concerns about the spread of new variants of the virus. The decision to cancel the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix will be a blow to the island's economy. The events are estimated to be worth around £10m to the island each year. However, the government said it was committed to supporting the island's tourism industry during the pandemic. ""We understand that this will be disappointing news for many people, but we hope that everyone will understand the reasons behind this difficult decision,"" Mr. Callister said. ""We look forward to welcoming visitors back to the Isle of Man for the 2022 Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The many ways to say sorry in Japanese,"In English, you either say ""sorry"" or ""apologies"". In Japanese, there are at least 20 different ways. One of the most casual is ""sumimasen"", which can be used in a variety of situations, from bumping into someone on the street to apologizing for interrupting a conversation. For more serious apologies, there are more formal expressions such as ""gomen nasai"" and ""moushiwake arimasen"". These are typically used when you have caused someone significant inconvenience or harm. The choice of apology also depends on the relationship between the speaker and the person they are apologizing to. For example, you would use a more formal apology when speaking to a superior or someone you don't know well. In addition to verbal apologies, there are also a number of non-verbal ways to apologize in Japanese. These include bowing, which is a sign of respect and humility. The deeper the bow, the more sincere the apology. Another way to apologize is to give a gift. This is often done in addition to a verbal apology, and it can help to show that you are truly sorry for your actions. The many ways to apologize in Japanese can be confusing for non-native speakers, but it is important to remember that the most important thing is to be sincere. If you are truly sorry for your actions, your apology will be well-received, regardless of the words you use. Here are some of the most common ways to apologize in Japanese: Sumimasen: This is the most casual way to apologize and can be used in a variety of situations. Gomen nasai: This is a more formal apology and is typically used when you have caused someone significant inconvenience or harm. Moushiwake arimasen: This is the most formal apology and is typically used when you have caused someone great harm. Arigatou gozaimasu: This is a phrase that is often used to express gratitude, but it can also be used to apologize. When used as an apology, it typically means ""Thank you for your understanding."" No matter which apology you choose to use, it is important to be sincere and to mean what you say. An apology is only effective if it comes from the heart.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Damascus military facilities 'hit by Israel rockets',"Syrian state media said the rockets hit the Jamraya research centre, which Western officials have suggested is involved in chemical and biological weapons development. The centre is located 15km (9 miles) north-west of the capital, Damascus. Syrian witnesses described how they saw two large explosions in the area. Israel has not commented on the explosions. The Israeli military has launched several air strikes on military targets in Syria in recent years. Last month, Israel said it had struck Syrian military targets in response to rockets being fired from Syria into Israeli-held territory. In 2017, Israel admitted to carrying out dozens of air strikes on Syrian military targets, saying it was preventing Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria. Iran is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has been accused of providing military support to the Syrian government. Israel has also expressed concern about the presence of Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist militant group and political party. It is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, the European Union, Canada, Israel, and the Arab League. Hezbollah has been fighting alongside Syrian government forces in the Syrian civil war. Israel is concerned that Hezbollah is using Syria as a base to launch attacks against Israel. In recent years, there has been an increase in tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran has been accused of developing nuclear weapons, and Israel has threatened to take military action to prevent this. The Israeli military has also launched several air strikes on Iranian military targets in Syria. The situation in Syria is complex and there are many different factions involved in the conflict. The Israeli air strikes are likely to further escalate tensions in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Caption mix-ups 'show lack of respect' for black MPs,"The Evening Standard used a picture of Bell Ribeiro-Addy in a story about fellow Labour MP Marsha de Cordova. The story was about BBC Parliament captioning Ms de Cordova as Labour deputy. BBC Parliament later apologised and corrected the caption, but the mix-up has sparked anger among black MPs. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham, told the BBC that the incident was ""yet another example of the lack of respect shown to black MPs"". ""This is not an isolated incident,"" she said. ""It's happened to me on numerous occasions, and I know it's happened to other black MPs as well."" Ribeiro-Addy said that the mix-ups were not just an inconvenience, but a way of undermining black MPs and their credibility. ""It sends a message that we are not as important as our white colleagues,"" she said. ""It suggests that we are interchangeable, and that our voices don't matter."" Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, said that the mistake was ""a clear case of racial profiling"". ""The fact that my picture was used in a story about someone else, who is also black, shows that the journalist was not paying attention to the facts,"" she said. ""I'm not surprised that this has happened, but I am angry and disappointed."" The BBC said that it was ""very sorry"" for the mistake and that it was investigating how it happened. ""We are committed to ensuring that our coverage is fair and accurate, and we take any allegations of bias very seriously,"" a BBC spokesperson said. The BBC has a long history of making mistakes in its coverage of black MPs. In 2017, the BBC was forced to apologise after it aired a segment in which a white reporter asked a black Labour MP if he was ""standing up to black thugs"". In 2018, the BBC was again forced to apologise after it published a picture of a black Labour MP next to a story about a stabbing in London. The BBC's repeated mistakes have led to accusations of racism and bias. In 2019, a group of black MPs wrote a letter to the BBC demanding that it take action to address the issue. The BBC has said that it is committed to improving its coverage of black MPs, but it is clear that more needs to be done. The recent mix-ups are a reminder that the BBC has a long way to go before it can truly claim to be fair and impartial.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson slams Saudi flags 'nonsense',"Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has slammed the ""nonsense"" of Saudi flags being flown outside businesses in Scotland. Davidson said it was ""completely unacceptable"" that the flags of a country with a ""disgraceful human rights record"" were being displayed in Scotland. Her comments came after a number of businesses in Scotland were seen flying the Saudi flag in support of the country's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Bin Salman has been accused of human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Davidson said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the flags of a country with such a disgraceful human rights record are being flown in Scotland. ""The Saudi regime has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people in Yemen, and its treatment of its own citizens is appalling. ""I urge businesses in Scotland to remove these flags immediately. They have no place in our country."" Davidson's comments were echoed by a number of other Scottish politicians. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: ""The Saudi regime is a brutal dictatorship that has no respect for human rights. ""It is deeply offensive to see their flags flying in Scotland. I urge businesses to remove them immediately."" Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ""The Saudi regime is one of the most repressive in the world. ""It is deeply concerning to see their flags being flown in Scotland. I urge businesses to remove them immediately."" The Scottish government has also been urged to take action to prevent Saudi flags from being flown in Scotland. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer has lodged a motion in the Scottish Parliament calling on the government to ""take all necessary steps to ensure that the flags of countries with poor human rights records are not flown on Scottish government buildings or land"". The motion is due to be debated in the Scottish Parliament in the coming weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Dead soldiers in Powys served with Territorial Army,"In a poignant ceremony held in the rolling hills of Powys, Wales, remains of 10 British soldiers who perished during World War I were finally laid to rest. These fallen heroes, long unidentified, had belonged to the Territorial Army, a volunteer force made up of civilians who served alongside the regular military. Their remains were discovered during the excavation of a trench system on private land near the village of Llanfyllin. They were found buried alongside their personal belongings, including buttons, badges, and fragments of uniforms, which helped identify them as members of the Territorial Army. The soldiers were part of the 1/5th Battalion, The King's Shropshire Light Infantry, a unit that saw heavy fighting during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The battle was one of the bloodiest in British military history, with hundreds of thousands of casualties. The remains of the soldiers were recovered by a team of archaeologists and historians. They were carefully examined and identified using a combination of forensic techniques, including DNA analysis and the study of dental records. The soldiers were identified as: - Private John Evans, aged 20 - Private William Jones, aged 22 - Private Thomas Davies, aged 23 - Private Richard Thomas, aged 24 - Private Edward Williams, aged 26 - Private David Roberts, aged 27 - Private John Hughes, aged 28 - Private William Davies, aged 29 - Private Thomas Jones, aged 30 - Private John Williams, aged 31 The soldiers' remains were interred in a military cemetery in Powys. They were given a full military funeral, with representatives from the British Army, the Royal British Legion, and the local community in attendance. The ceremony was a moving tribute to the fallen soldiers and a reminder of the sacrifices made by the Territorial Army during World War I. Their legacy as brave and dedicated volunteers will continue to inspire future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Elon Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan,"Elon Musk's Boring Company has unveiled plans for a network of tunnels under Los Angeles, designed to alleviate traffic congestion in the sprawling metropolis. The ambitious project, dubbed the ""LA Loop,"" envisions a network of high-speed, underground tunnels that would transport passengers in autonomous electric vehicles. The Boring Company's proposal calls for the construction of up to 60 miles of tunnels, with stations located near major destinations such as LAX Airport, Downtown Los Angeles, and Santa Monica. Passengers would enter the tunnels through dedicated stations and board autonomous vehicles for a high-speed journey to their destination. According to Musk, the LA Loop could significantly reduce travel times. For example, a trip from LAX to Downtown Los Angeles, which currently takes about 45 minutes by car during peak hours, could be completed in just 15 minutes through the tunnel. The Boring Company has already begun drilling exploratory tunnels in Los Angeles, and Musk has stated that he hopes to start construction on the full network by the end of 2023. The project is expected to cost several billion dollars and will require the approval of local authorities and environmental regulators. The LA Loop has been met with mixed reactions. Some transportation experts have praised the project's potential to reduce congestion, while others have questioned its feasibility and environmental impact. Critics have also raised concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in an underground environment. Despite the challenges, Musk remains optimistic about the project. He believes that the LA Loop could revolutionize urban transportation and make Los Angeles a more livable city. Key features of the LA Loop: - High-speed tunnels: The tunnels would be designed for speeds of up to 125 miles per hour. - Autonomous vehicles: Passengers would ride in autonomous electric vehicles, eliminating the need for human drivers. - Multiple stations: The network would have multiple stations located near major destinations throughout Los Angeles. - Reduced travel times: The Boring Company claims that the LA Loop could reduce travel times by up to 75%. - Environmental benefits: By reducing traffic congestion, the LA Loop could have positive environmental impacts, such as reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Food bank charity gives record level of supplies,"Food banks are providing a record number of emergency food supplies as the cost-of-living crisis deepens, figures show. In December, the Trussell Trust handed out more than 2.5 million food parcels - the highest monthly total since the charity began recording data in 2013. It comes as inflation hit a 40-year high of 10.5% in December, and energy bills continue to soar. The Trussell Trust said the figures were ""a damning indictment of the state of our society"". Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: ""The fact that food banks are providing record levels of emergency food to people in the UK is a damning indictment of the state of our society. ""We should not be in a situation where people are having to turn to food banks because they cannot afford to feed themselves and their families."" The charity said that the cost-of-living crisis was having a ""devastating impact"" on people, with more and more families struggling to make ends meet. ""We are seeing people who have never needed to use a food bank before,"" Ms Revie said. ""This includes people in work, who are simply unable to keep up with the rising cost of living."" The Trussell Trust said that the government needed to take action to help people, including increasing benefits and the minimum wage. ""We cannot continue to live in a society where people are forced to rely on charity to put food on the table,"" Ms Revie said. In response to the figures, the government said it was ""committed to supporting people with the cost of living"". A spokesperson said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing and are providing £26 billion of support this year through our Energy Price Guarantee, Household Support Fund and other measures."" The spokesperson added that the government was ""also taking action to support low-income households through the tax system, including increasing the National Living Wage and reducing taxes."" But critics say that the government is not doing enough to help people, and that the cost-of-living crisis is only going to get worse. The Resolution Foundation think tank said that the government's support package was ""not enough"" and that the number of people living in poverty was set to rise by 1.3 million this year. Torsten Bell, the foundation's chief executive, said: ""The government needs to do more to help people with the cost of living, or we will see more and more people being forced to rely on food banks.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Diabetes life expectancy 'improving', study finds","Diabetes Life Expectancy 'Improving', Study Finds A new study has found that people with diabetes are living longer than ever before. The research, published in the journal Diabetologia, found that the average life expectancy for people with diabetes has increased by more than 10 years since the 1980s. The study analyzed data from over 1 million people with diabetes in the UK. Researchers found that the average life expectancy for people with type 1 diabetes has increased from 54 years in the 1980s to 75 years today. For people with type 2 diabetes, the average life expectancy has increased from 68 years in the 1980s to 80 years today. The study also found that the gap in life expectancy between people with diabetes and those without diabetes is narrowing. In the 1980s, people with diabetes were expected to die 10 years earlier than those without diabetes. Today, the gap has narrowed to just 5 years. The researchers say that the improvements in life expectancy are due to a number of factors, including better diabetes management, improved access to healthcare, and the development of new diabetes medications. ""These findings are very encouraging,"" said lead author Professor John McMurray of the University of Glasgow. ""They show that people with diabetes are living longer and healthier lives than ever before."" However, Professor McMurray cautioned that there is still more work to be done. ""Diabetes is still a serious disease, and it can lead to a number of complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure,"" he said. ""We need to continue to work to improve diabetes care and to find ways to prevent these complications."" The study's findings are in line with other recent research that has shown that the life expectancy of people with diabetes is improving. A study published in the journal The Lancet in 2018 found that the average life expectancy for people with type 1 diabetes in the UK had increased by 12 years since the 1990s. The improvements in life expectancy for people with diabetes are a testament to the hard work of researchers, healthcare professionals, and people with diabetes themselves. With continued research and innovation, we can continue to improve the lives of people with diabetes and help them live longer, healthier lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

King's Lynn incinerator: Alternative technology considered,"King's Lynn incinerator: Alternative technology considered King's Lynn incinerator could be replaced with a new facility using alternative technology, under plans being considered by Norfolk County Council. The incinerator, which burns waste to generate electricity, has been in operation since 1998 and is nearing the end of its operational life. The county council is now exploring options for its replacement, including the use of alternative technologies such as gasification or pyrolysis. Gasification involves heating waste in a low-oxygen environment to produce a gas that can be used to generate electricity or heat. Pyrolysis is a similar process, but it takes place in the absence of oxygen, producing a solid char that can be used as a fuel. Both gasification and pyrolysis are considered to be more environmentally friendly than incineration, as they produce fewer emissions. They can also be used to process a wider range of waste materials, including plastics and hazardous waste. The county council is currently carrying out a feasibility study to assess the potential for using alternative technologies at the King's Lynn incinerator site. The study is due to be completed in the summer of 2023. In the meantime, the council is continuing to operate the incinerator in a safe and efficient manner. The plant is subject to regular environmental monitoring and meets all relevant emissions standards. A spokesperson for the county council said: ""We are committed to exploring all options for the future of the King's Lynn incinerator. We are particularly interested in the potential for using alternative technologies that are more environmentally friendly and can process a wider range of waste materials."" ""The feasibility study will help us to assess the potential for these technologies and to make an informed decision about the future of the incinerator.""

The rocket that eats itself,"The Rocket That Eats Itself In a groundbreaking achievement, scientists have unveiled a revolutionary rocket design that consumes its own fuel tank to generate thrust. This innovative concept, known as the ""cannibal rocket,"" has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of space missions. The secret behind the cannibal rocket lies in its ability to use its own fuel tank as a source of propellant. By meticulously tailoring the shape and structure of the tank, engineers have enabled it to act as a nozzle that guides the expanding gases expelled by the engine. This eliminates the need for a separate nozzle, reducing the weight and complexity of the rocket. As the rocket ascends, it strategically consumes its fuel tank from the bottom upwards. This continuous process provides a constant flow of propellant to the engine, ensuring sustained thrust without the need for additional fuel tanks. The result is a more efficient and compact propulsion system that can carry a greater payload into space. The concept of a cannibal rocket has been explored for decades, but practical challenges have hindered its development. One major obstacle was the need to maintain the structural integrity of the fuel tank as it gradually erodes. To overcome this, researchers employed advanced materials and sophisticated engineering techniques to ensure that the tank can withstand the intense heat and pressure during the combustion process. The potential applications of cannibal rockets are vast. They could enable longer and more ambitious space missions, such as manned expeditions to Mars or the exploration of distant asteroids. Additionally, the reduced weight and complexity of these rockets could make them more cost-effective for commercial satellite launches and other space-based activities. Moreover, the cannibal rocket concept has implications beyond space exploration. The same principles could be applied to other propulsion systems, such as hypersonic aircraft and underwater vehicles. By eliminating the need for separate fuel tanks and nozzles, these systems can achieve greater efficiency and performance. The development of the cannibal rocket represents a significant milestone in rocketry. Its innovative design promises to revolutionize space exploration and open up new possibilities for the future of space travel. As scientists continue to refine and optimize this concept, we can expect to witness even greater advancements in the efficiency and capabilities of rockets in the years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The campaign's name cleverly plays on the derogatory term ""unfair,"" which is often used to describe people with dark skin. By reclaiming this term, #UnfairandLovely turns the negative connotation on its head and transforms it into a positive affirmation. The campaign has gained significant traction on social media, with thousands of people sharing stories and images under the #UnfairandLovely hashtag. Participants have shared photos of themselves embracing their dark skin, along with personal narratives about the challenges and triumphs they have faced. ""Growing up, I always felt like I didn't fit in because of my dark skin,"" said one participant. ""I was constantly bombarded with messages that fair skin was better and more desirable. But this campaign has helped me to break free from that mindset and to embrace my unique beauty."" #UnfairandLovely is not just about changing perceptions of beauty but also about challenging the systemic biases that perpetuate colorism. Colorism, the discrimination based on skin color, often results in reduced opportunities, both socially and economically, for people with darker skin tones. The campaign is calling for an end to these discriminatory practices and for the promotion of inclusivity and equality. It advocates for representation of dark-skinned individuals in all areas of society, from media to education and the workplace.

US Supreme Court hears case of Mexican teen slain by border patrol,"In a highly anticipated case that has garnered international attention, the US Supreme Court heard arguments this week in the wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of 16-year-old Sergio Adrián Hernández Güereca. Hernández was shot and killed in 2010 by a US Border Patrol agent while playing with friends on the Mexican side of the border. The case has raised fundamental questions about the excessive use of force, the rights of individuals at the border, and the accountability of law enforcement officers. The Mexican government has filed an amicus brief in support of the Hernández family, arguing that the shooting violated international law and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The central issue before the Court is whether US agents can be held liable under US law for actions taken outside US territory. The Biden administration has argued that agents have qualified immunity from such suits, while the Hernández family's lawyers contend that the agents' actions were clearly unreasonable and excessive. During the oral arguments, Justice Elena Kagan expressed concern that a ruling in favor of the government would give agents ""carte blanche"" to use deadly force along the border. She questioned why the agents could not have used non-lethal means, such as warning shots or pepper spray, to deter Hernández and his friends. Justice Samuel Alito, however, suggested that the agents were justified in using deadly force because they believed Hernández was throwing rocks at them, which posed a threat to their safety. He argued that the agents had a ""split-second"" to make a decision and should not be held liable for their actions. The case has also sparked a broader debate about US border policy and the treatment of migrants. Advocates for immigrant rights have condemned the shooting as an example of excessive force and the militarization of the border. They argue that the use of deadly force against unarmed individuals violates basic human rights. The Court's decision in this case is expected to have significant implications for the accountability of law enforcement officers and the rights of individuals at the border. It will also send a message about US border policy and the treatment of migrants. A ruling in favor of the government could grant agents wide latitude to use deadly force, while a ruling in favor of the Hernández family could strengthen the protections for individuals at the border.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Northampton Town loan firm received £900k in VAT repayments,"Northampton Town loan firm received £900k in VAT repayments A loan firm based in Northampton has received almost £900,000 in VAT repayments over the past four years, despite concerns about its lending practices. The firm, which cannot be named for legal reasons, has been the subject of numerous complaints from customers who say they were charged excessive interest rates and fees. In 2019, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigated the firm and found that it had breached a number of regulations. The FCA imposed a £50,000 fine on the firm and ordered it to repay £1.2 million to customers. Despite the FCA's action, the firm has continued to receive VAT repayments. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed that the firm received £898,742 in VAT repayments between 2018 and 2022. HMRC said that it had carried out a review of the firm's VAT claims and was satisfied that they were valid. However, HMRC did not disclose the specific criteria that it used to assess the validity of the claims. The firm's receipt of VAT repayments has raised concerns among consumer groups. They argue that the repayments are effectively subsidising a firm that has been found to have breached regulations and charged excessive interest rates to customers. ""It is deeply concerning that a firm that has been found to have breached regulations is still able to receive VAT repayments,"" said James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance. ""This suggests that there is a loophole in the system that allows firms to avoid paying their fair share of tax."" The Treasury has said that it is unaware of any specific concerns about the firm's VAT repayments.

Theresa May's 'honeymoon period' boosts Tory polling,"Theresa May's ""honeymoon period"" as Prime Minister has boosted the Conservative Party's standing in the polls, according to a new survey. The poll, conducted by YouGov for The Times, found that the Conservatives have opened up a seven-point lead over the Labour Party, with 42% of voters saying they would vote Tory if an election were held tomorrow. This is the first time the Conservatives have led Labour in the polls since the 2015 general election. May's personal approval ratings have also improved since she became Prime Minister, with 46% of voters saying they approve of the way she is doing her job. This is up from 36% when she first took office. The poll suggests that May is enjoying a ""honeymoon period"" as Prime Minister, similar to that experienced by her predecessor David Cameron after the 2010 general election. Cameron's honeymoon period lasted around six months, and it remains to be seen whether May will be able to sustain her current levels of support for a similar amount of time. However, the poll also found that the public is still divided over May's policies. Only 37% of voters say they support her plan to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union, while 39% oppose it. May's popularity is also likely to be tested by the upcoming negotiations with the EU over the terms of Britain's exit. If she is able to secure a good deal for the UK, it could further boost her support. However, if the negotiations are difficult or unsuccessful, it could damage her reputation and lead to a decline in her popularity. Overall, the poll suggests that May is enjoying a positive start to her premiership. However, it remains to be seen whether she will be able to sustain her current levels of support in the long term.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Welsh Government to implement ban on microbeads,"The Welsh Government has announced a ban on the manufacture, sale, and use of products containing microbeads in Wales. Microbeads are tiny plastic particles that are often found in personal care products such as face washes, scrubs, and toothpastes. They are also used in industrial products such as paints and polishes. Microbeads are a major source of pollution, as they can easily enter the environment through wastewater treatment plants. Once in the environment, they can be ingested by marine life, where they can accumulate in the food chain and potentially cause harm to human health. The Welsh Government's ban on microbeads is part of a wider effort to reduce plastic pollution in Wales. The ban will come into force in 2023, and will apply to all products that are manufactured, sold, or used in Wales. The Welsh Government is the first UK government to implement a ban on microbeads. The ban has been welcomed by environmental groups, who have long campaigned for action to be taken on microbeads. ""This is a landmark decision that will help to protect our environment and our health,"" said Friends of the Earth Cymru campaigner, Haf Elgar. ""Microbeads are a major source of plastic pollution, and they can have a devastating impact on marine life. This ban will help to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans, and it will protect the health of our planet for future generations."" The Welsh Government's ban on microbeads is a significant step forward in the fight against plastic pollution. It is hoped that other governments will follow Wales' lead and implement similar bans. In addition to the ban on microbeads, the Welsh Government is also working to reduce plastic pollution through a number of other measures. These include: A ban on the sale of single-use plastic bags A commitment to reduce the use of single-use plastics in the public sector Investment in research and development to find new and innovative ways to reduce plastic pollution The Welsh Government is committed to taking action on plastic pollution. The ban on microbeads is a significant step forward, and it is hoped that other governments will follow Wales' lead.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Porthmadog bypass section opens early for Cob festival,"Porthmadog bypass section opens early for Cob festival A section of the new Porthmadog bypass has opened early to allow access to the town's popular Cob festival. The £135m bypass is due to open in full later this year, but the section between the A497 and the B4411 has been completed early to provide a vital link to the festival site. The Cob festival is a traditional Welsh festival that celebrates the harvesting of cobs, a type of seaweed. The festival attracts thousands of visitors to Porthmadog each year, and the new bypass will help to ease congestion and improve access to the event. The Welsh Government has provided £75m towards the cost of the bypass, with the remaining £60m coming from the UK Government. The bypass is expected to reduce journey times between Porthmadog and the A487 by up to 10 minutes, and it will also improve safety by removing through traffic from the town centre. The opening of the bypass section is a major milestone in the project, and it is a welcome boost for the Cob festival. Festival organisers delighted Festival organiser Alun Roberts said: ""We are delighted that the bypass section has opened early for the Cob festival. This will make it much easier for people to get to the festival site, and it will also help to reduce congestion in the town centre.""

'Lamentable' defence spending decisions attacked by MPs,"MPs from across the political spectrum have strongly criticized the government's 'deplorable' defence spending decisions, accusing it of putting the UK's security at risk. The criticism came after the government announced plans to cut the number of British troops by 9,500, as well as reduce the size of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. The cuts have been met with widespread condemnation from MPs, who argue that they will weaken the UK's ability to defend itself against potential threats. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said the cuts were a ""false economy"" that would ""diminish our ability to respond to threats around the world."" He added: ""It is a deplorable state of affairs when our armed forces are being cut at a time when the threats we face are increasing."" Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the cuts were a ""betrayal"" of the armed forces and would leave the UK ""less safe."" He said: ""These cuts will make it harder for our armed forces to protect our country and its interests. It is a betrayal of our armed forces and it will make the UK less safe."" The Liberal Democrats' defence spokesman, Jamie Stone, said the cuts were ""short-sighted"" and would ""damage the UK's reputation as a global leader."" He said: ""These cuts are short-sighted and will damage the UK's reputation as a global leader. They will leave us less able to respond to threats around the world and will make us more vulnerable to attack."" The government has defended the cuts, arguing that they are necessary to reduce the UK's budget deficit. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The government is committed to ensuring that the UK has the armed forces it needs to defend itself against all threats. We are making the necessary changes to ensure that our armed forces are fit for the future."" However, the government's assurances have failed to convince MPs, who are demanding that the cuts be reversed. A group of cross-party MPs have tabled an amendment to the government's defence spending plans, which would require the government to increase defence spending by £20 billion over the next four years. The amendment is expected to be debated in the House of Commons in the coming weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Jeremy Corbyn: Children's talents being squandered,"Amidst the political turmoil engulfing the country, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has decried the government's ""systematic dismantling"" of vital services, warning that the nation's children are bearing the brunt of austerity measures. In a blistering speech delivered at a children's center in one of London's most deprived boroughs, Corbyn accused the Conservatives of ""squandering the talents of a generation"" through relentless cuts to education and youth services. ""Every child in this country deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential,"" Corbyn proclaimed. ""But this government is shamefully denying them that chance by ripping away the resources they need to thrive."" The Labour leader painted a grim picture of a society where children from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly condemned to a future of poverty and inequality. He pointed to the closure of youth clubs, the reduction of educational support, and the rising cost of childcare as evidence of the government's neglect. ""These services are not luxuries,"" Corbyn emphasized. ""They are essential for giving our children the best possible start in life. By cutting them, the government is condemning countless young people to a cycle of deprivation and hopelessness."" Corbyn's speech resonated strongly with the audience at the children's center, many of whom have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of austerity on their communities. Parents and children alike expressed their frustration and anger at the government's policies. ""My son used to go to the youth club every week,"" one mother lamented. ""It was the only place he could go to feel safe and have fun. But now it's closed, and he's just hanging around the streets with nothing to do."" A young boy named Daniel, who attends a local primary school, spoke of his dreams of becoming a doctor one day. However, he expressed concern that he may not be able to afford university fees without the support of free school meals. ""I want to do well in school, but it's hard when you're always hungry,"" Daniel said. ""I don't know how I'm going to pay for university if the government keeps cutting the budgets."" Corbyn concluded his speech by pledging to reverse the government's austerity agenda and invest heavily in children's services. He promised to restore funding to schools, youth clubs, and childcare providers, ensuring that every child has the chance to succeed, regardless of their background. ""Our children are our future,"" Corbyn declared. ""We cannot afford to squander their talents. We must invest in them now, so that they can build a better future for themselves and for our country.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Trump defends Fox host Bill O'Reilly amid sex claims,"Amidst a flurry of sexual harassment allegations against Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, President Donald Trump has come to his defense. The President's comments, made during an interview with The New York Times, have drawn criticism from some quarters. ""I don't think Bill did anything wrong,"" Trump said. ""He's a good person."" Trump's defense of O'Reilly is the latest in a series of statements in which he has expressed support for individuals accused of sexual misconduct. In October 2016, he famously dismissed the Access Hollywood tape, in which he was heard making crude and sexually suggestive remarks about women. He has also defended Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. Trump's comments have been met with criticism from some, who argue that they send a message that sexual harassment and assault are not taken seriously. Others, however, have defended Trump's right to express his opinions and have pointed out that he has not been accused of any wrongdoing himself. The allegations against O'Reilly have been made by five women, who claim that he made unwanted sexual advances towards them. O'Reilly has denied the allegations, calling them ""completely unfounded."" Fox News has also defended O'Reilly, saying that it has ""looked into these allegations and found them to be without merit."" However, the allegations have led to a number of advertisers withdrawing their support from O'Reilly's show, The O'Reilly Factor. The show has also been suspended by Fox News pending an internal investigation. The allegations against O'Reilly have come at a time when sexual harassment and assault are under intense scrutiny in the media and in the public sphere.

"Doctors 'miss' underweight children, UCL study suggests","Doctors 'miss' underweight children, UCL study suggests Children who are underweight are being ""missed"" by doctors, a new study suggests. The research, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that nearly half of underweight children in the UK are not identified by their GP. This is despite the fact that underweight children are at increased risk of health problems, including stunted growth, delayed development, and weakened immune systems. The study, led by researchers at University College London (UCL), analyzed data from over 3,000 children aged 0-19 in the UK. They found that 5.4% of children were underweight, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below the 5th percentile. However, only 27.6% of underweight children had been identified by their GP. This means that nearly half of underweight children are not receiving the care and support they need to improve their health. The researchers say that there are a number of reasons why doctors may miss underweight children. One reason is that underweight children may not be noticeably thin. Another reason is that doctors may not be routinely measuring children's weight and height. The researchers say that it is important for doctors to be aware of the signs and symptoms of underweight children. They also say that doctors should routinely measure children's weight and height. This will help to ensure that underweight children are identified and receive the care they need. The study also found that underweight children were more likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds. This suggests that poverty may be a risk factor for underweight. The researchers say that further research is needed to explore the link between poverty and underweight. They also say that interventions are needed to improve the health of underweight children. These interventions could include providing financial support to families, improving access to healthy food, and increasing awareness of the importance of healthy eating.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
UK banks 'prepared for Brexit and trade war fall-out',"UK banks 'prepared for Brexit and trade war fall-out' British banks are well-prepared to withstand the potential economic fallout from Brexit and a global trade war, according to a new report. The analysis by consultancy firm EY found that UK lenders have increased their capital buffers and reduced their exposure to risky assets in recent years. This has made them more resilient to financial shocks. The report also found that UK banks have been diversifying their sources of funding, making them less reliant on wholesale markets. This means that they are less likely to be affected by a downturn in the global economy.

""These measures have made them more resilient to financial shocks and better able to support the UK economy."" The report comes as the UK prepares to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. There is uncertainty about the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, and some businesses are concerned about the potential impact on the UK economy. However, the EY report suggests that UK banks are well-prepared for any potential economic shocks. The report found that UK banks have increased their capital buffers by 25% since 2014. This means that they have more money available to absorb losses in the event of a downturn. UK banks have also reduced their exposure to risky assets. The report found that the proportion of risky assets on UK banks' balance sheets has fallen from 30% to 20% since 2014. This means that UK banks are less likely to be affected by a fall in asset prices. In addition, UK banks have been diversifying their sources of funding. The report found that the proportion of wholesale funding on UK banks' balance sheets has fallen from 60% to 40% since 2014. This means that UK banks are less reliant on short-term funding, which can be more expensive and less stable. The EY report suggests that UK banks are well-prepared for any potential economic shocks.

Unhealthy food 'returning to school' warn caterers,"Unhealthy Food 'Returning to School' Warn Caterers School caterers have raised concerns that unhealthy food is making a comeback in schools, undermining efforts to promote healthy eating habits among children. The warning comes as new research suggests that the proportion of schools offering unhealthy food options has increased in recent years. A survey conducted by the School Food Trust found that 43% of schools now offer sugary drinks, compared to 12% in 2013. The survey also revealed that 25% of schools offer crisps, and 42% offer chocolate bars. These findings contradict government guidelines, which recommend that schools should provide healthy and nutritious food options for their pupils. The catering industry has attributed the increase in unhealthy food offerings to a number of factors, including budget constraints and parental pressure. Some caterers argue that they are forced to sell unhealthy food to make ends meet, while others claim that parents demand access to such products. However, public health experts argue that schools have a responsibility to protect the health of their pupils. They emphasize that unhealthy food can contribute to a range of health problems, including obesity, tooth decay, and heart disease. ""Schools should be places where children can learn about and access healthy food,"" said Dr. Susan Jebb, a nutrition and public health expert at the University of Oxford. ""Offering unhealthy options undermines these efforts and sends the wrong message to children."" The return of unhealthy food to schools has prompted calls for stricter regulations. Some experts are proposing a ban on the sale of sugary drinks and junk food in schools, while others believe that schools should be given more resources to provide healthier options. The government has stated that it is committed to improving the health of children and will explore a range of options to reduce the availability of unhealthy food in schools. In the meantime, caterers and parents are urged to work together to ensure that children have access to healthy and nutritious food.

Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there was ""no room for complacency"". He said the UK's flu vaccine programme was one of the best in the world, but it was ""not perfect"". The NHS is urging people to get their flu jab as soon as possible to protect themselves from the virus. Eligible people in England can book their jab online or by calling 119. Prof Openshaw told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think we need to be thinking about the winter ahead as being a potentially difficult winter, because we've got flu coming back and we've still got Covid circulating. ""I think flu could be quite severe this year. We haven't had much flu for the last couple of years because of all the other measures that we've had in place to try and control Covid. ""But flu is still out there and it's likely to come back quite strongly this year."" He said it was important to remember that flu can be a ""very nasty disease"" and can lead to hospitalisation and even death. ""I would urge everybody to take up the offer of flu vaccination. It's the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,"" he said. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said the flu jab was ""the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones"". She said: ""The flu vaccine is safe and effective. It's the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the virus. ""I urge everyone who is eligible to get their flu jab as soon as possible."" The flu vaccine is offered free to people at risk, including those aged 65 and over, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions. The NHS is also offering a free Covid-19 booster jab to people aged 50 and over, and those with certain health conditions. People can book their Covid-19 booster jab online or by calling 119.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
High heels row: Petition for work dress code law rejected,"A petition calling for a law against mandatory high-heel dress codes in the workplace has been rejected by the UK government, despite receiving over 150,000 signatures. The petition, started by Nicola Thorp in 2016 after she was sent home from work for refusing to wear high heels, argued that such dress codes were discriminatory and caused physical pain. In its response, the government said that existing laws already provided sufficient protection against discrimination and that it did not believe a specific law on high heels was necessary. It also pointed out that employers were free to set their own dress codes, as long as they were applied fairly and did not discriminate against any particular group of employees. Thorp, who launched a campaign called ""Time's Up on Heels"" after her experience, said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the government's decision. She argued that the existing laws on discrimination were not strong enough to protect women from being forced to wear high heels, and that a specific law was needed to make it clear that such dress codes were unacceptable. ""This is a missed opportunity to send a clear message that women should not be discriminated against because of their choice of footwear,"" Thorp said. ""It is time for the government to take action and ensure that women are not forced to choose between their dignity and their livelihood."" The government's decision has also been criticized by trade unions and women's rights groups. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that the government was ""out of touch"" with the experiences of women in the workplace, while the Fawcett Society said that the decision was ""a blow to women's equality."" The issue of high-heel dress codes has been debated for many years, with some arguing that they are a form of sexism and discrimination, while others contend that they are a legitimate part of a professional dress code. A number of countries, including Canada and Australia, have already banned mandatory high-heel dress codes, while others, such as the UK and the US, are still considering the issue. In the UK, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said that it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees on the basis of their sex, which could include forcing them to wear high heels. However, the EHRC has also said that employers are able to set dress codes, as long as they are applied fairly and do not discriminate against any particular group of employees.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Derek Bonnard: Cleveland officer 'branded criminal',"Derek Bonnard was a Cleveland police officer who was branded a criminal after he was convicted of stealing $200,000 from a drug dealer. Bonnard was a 12-year veteran of the force when he was arrested in 2012. He was accused of stealing the money during a drug raid. Bonnard claimed that he had found the money and that he had intended to turn it over to his superiors. However, prosecutors said that Bonnard had lied about finding the money and that he had actually stolen it. Bonnard was convicted of theft in 2013 and sentenced to three years in prison. He was also fired from the police force. Bonnard's conviction was a major embarrassment for the Cleveland Police Department. The department had been under fire for years for its use of excessive force and for its lack of accountability. Bonnard's conviction only served to further erode public trust in the department. In the years since his conviction, Bonnard has been trying to rebuild his life. He has started a new career as a truck driver and he is also working to get his criminal record expunged. Bonnard says that he is ashamed of what he did and that he regrets the pain that he caused his family and friends. He says that he is determined to make amends for his past mistakes and to become a productive member of society. Bonnard's story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of corruption. It is a reminder that even those who are entrusted with upholding the law can be tempted to break it. Bonnard's story is also a story of redemption. It is a reminder that even those who have made serious mistakes can turn their lives around.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
South Korea warns North against satellite launch,"South Korea warns North against satellite launch South Korea has warned North Korea against launching a satellite, saying it would be a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The North has said it plans to launch a satellite between February 8 and 25, but the US and its allies believe it is a cover for a test of long-range missile technology. South Korea's foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said on Tuesday that any launch would be ""a clear violation"" of the resolutions. ""We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from taking any actions that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. The US has also warned North Korea against the launch, saying it would be ""a provocative act"" that would violate UN Security Council resolutions. The UN Security Council has banned North Korea from conducting any ballistic missile or nuclear tests. North Korea has defended its plans to launch the satellite, saying it is for peaceful purposes. However, experts believe that the launch could be used to test technology that could be used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBMs are capable of carrying nuclear warheads and reaching targets thousands of miles away. The launch would be the North's first since it fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in November 2017. That launch was widely condemned by the international community, and the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response. The US has also sent a number of warships to the region in a show of force. The launch would come at a time of heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. The two sides have been engaged in a war of words over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The US has also imposed a number of sanctions on North Korea in an effort to pressure the country to give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea has responded by threatening to attack the US and its allies. The launch would be a further escalation of tensions between the two sides.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Vodafone and TalkTalk report surge in internet use,"Vodafone and TalkTalk Report Surge in Internet Use Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in internet usage as people work from home, study remotely, and engage in online entertainment. Leading telecommunications providers Vodafone and TalkTalk have reported a significant surge in internet traffic since the outbreak began. Vodafone, one of the world's largest mobile and broadband providers, said it has seen a 40% increase in mobile data usage and a 50% increase in fixed broadband traffic in the UK since the government implemented lockdown measures. The company also reported a 60% rise in video call traffic on its mobile network. TalkTalk, another major UK provider, echoed similar trends. The company said it has seen a 35% increase in broadband usage during peak hours, with average broadband traffic rising by 15%. It also reported a 100% increase in voice calls to its customer service team. The surge in internet use is largely attributed to the widespread adoption of remote working and virtual learning. With schools and offices closed, millions of people are relying on the internet to connect with colleagues, classmates, and loved ones. Online entertainment platforms have also seen a significant boost. Streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ have reported record-high viewership numbers. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have also seen increased activity as people stay connected and share information. The increased internet traffic has put a strain on networks, but both Vodafone and TalkTalk have assured customers that they have sufficient capacity to meet the demand. Vodafone said it has invested heavily in its infrastructure in recent years, while TalkTalk has implemented a series of measures to optimise its network performance. However, the surge in usage has highlighted the importance of reliable and affordable broadband access for everyone. The government has pledged to invest in digital infrastructure to ensure that all citizens have access to high-speed internet, regardless of their location or income. As the pandemic continues, internet usage is expected to remain high. Both Vodafone and TalkTalk have said they are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to invest in their networks to meet the needs of their customers.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus in South Africa: Misuse of Covid-19 funds 'frightening',"Coronavirus in South Africa: Misuse of Covid-19 Funds 'Frightening' A shocking report has revealed the widespread misuse of Covid-19 relief funds in South Africa, raising concerns about the erosion of public trust and the impact on the country's recovery efforts. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU), tasked with probing corruption allegations, found that billions of rand allocated to fight the pandemic were siphoned off through irregular tenders, inflated prices, and fraudulent claims. ""The extent of the looting is frightening,"" said SIU head Andy Mothibi. ""We have unearthed evidence of blatant disregard for proper procurement processes and gross overpricing, resulting in millions of rand being lost to corruption."" One of the most egregious cases involved the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) at inflated prices. The SIU found that certain companies charged up to 500% more than the market rate for gloves, masks, and sanitizers. In another instance, a company was awarded a contract to supply food parcels to vulnerable households, but the parcels contained expired and rotten food. The misuse of funds has had a devastating impact on South Africa's response to the pandemic. Hospitals have been left short of essential supplies, while vulnerable communities have been denied critical aid. ""This corruption has undermined the public's trust in government and eroded the credibility of our institutions,"" said Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. ""We must take decisive action to recover these funds and hold those responsible accountable."" President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to crack down on corruption and ensure that the stolen funds are returned. The SIU has already filed criminal charges against several individuals and companies, and further arrests are expected. However, experts warn that recovering the funds and restoring public trust will be a long and challenging process. ""This is not just about money; it's about the integrity of our society,"" said independent anti-corruption activist Thuli Madonsela. ""We must ensure that those who looted these funds are brought to justice and that we put in place strong mechanisms to prevent such abuses in the future."" The misuse of Covid-19 funds has cast a dark shadow over South Africa's fight against the pandemic. The government must act decisively to address this crisis, rebuild trust, and ensure that every rand intended for fighting Covid-19 is used for its intended purpose.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Afghanistan war: Deadly Taliban attack 'destroys' hospital,"Deadly Taliban Attack 'Destroys' Hospital in Afghanistan, Killing Dozens A brutal Taliban attack in Afghanistan has claimed dozens of lives and destroyed a provincial hospital, leaving the local community in shock and mourning. The assault targeted the hospital in the eastern province of Paktika, which was providing critical healthcare services to the war-torn region. According to health officials, at least 30 people, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as the Taliban stormed the hospital, firing indiscriminately and setting it ablaze. ""I heard a loud explosion, and then there was gunfire everywhere,"" said one survivor. ""I saw people screaming and running for their lives."" The attack comes amid escalating violence in Afghanistan, as the Taliban continues to make gains in the wake of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces. The militant group has been accused of committing numerous atrocities, including targeted killings of civilians. The United Nations condemned the attack on the hospital as a ""war crime"" and called for an immediate investigation. ""The deliberate targeting of medical facilities is a violation of international humanitarian law,"" said a UN spokesperson. The destruction of the hospital is a devastating loss for the community, which relied on it for essential medical care. Health workers were said to be in a state of shock and disbelief, while patients and their families faced an uncertain future. ""We have lost everything,"" said one doctor. ""This was the only hospital in the area, and now it's gone. Our patients are suffering, and we have no way to help them."" The attack has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, with governments and aid agencies expressing their outrage and calling for accountability. The United States and the European Union have vowed to support the Afghan people and hold the Taliban accountable for their actions. However, the grim reality is that Afghanistan remains a country in turmoil, torn apart by decades of war and political instability. The Taliban's resurgence has plunged the country into a new era of uncertainty, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence. The attack on the hospital in Paktika is a tragic reminder of the human cost of war and the urgent need for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Hillary Clinton's approval bubble has popped,"Hillary Clinton's approval bubble has popped. A recent poll shows that her favorability rating has dropped to just 38%, down from a high of 65% in October 2016. This decline is likely due to a number of factors, including her handling of the email scandal, her perceived lack of trustworthiness, and her association with the unpopular Obama administration. Clinton's email scandal has been a major source of controversy since it was first revealed in 2015. The FBI investigated Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State, and concluded that she had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. This finding has led many voters to question Clinton's judgment and trustworthiness. Clinton's perceived lack of trustworthiness is another factor that has contributed to her declining approval ratings. In a recent poll, only 32% of Americans said that they trust Clinton to tell the truth. This is a significant decline from the 58% of Americans who said they trusted Clinton in 2016. Clinton's association with the Obama administration is also a factor that has hurt her approval ratings. The Obama administration was unpopular with many Americans, and Clinton's close ties to Obama have led some voters to view her as part of the same failed establishment. The decline in Clinton's approval ratings is a major setback for her political career. She is now considered a long shot to win the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. If she does not win the nomination, it will be a major blow to her legacy as one of the most powerful and influential women in American history. Clinton's declining approval ratings are a reflection of the deep divisions in American politics today. Many Americans are angry and frustrated with the status quo, and they are looking for a change. Clinton is seen by many as part of the problem, not the solution. It is unclear what Clinton will do next. She could retire from politics, or she could try to rebuild her reputation and run for office again. Whatever she decides to do, her legacy will be forever tarnished by the email scandal and her declining approval ratings.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

But for police officers, it is a dreaded event. In recent years, the carnival has been marred by violence and crime. In 2018, there were 355 arrests and 104 reported crimes, including sexual assaults, robberies, and drug offenses. Police officers say they are concerned about the level of violence and crime at the carnival. They say that the crowds are often hostile and aggressive, and that it is difficult to control the situation. ""It's a very difficult event to police,"" said one police officer. ""The crowds are so large and there are so many people drinking and taking drugs. It's a recipe for disaster."" The police have taken steps to try to reduce the level of violence and crime at the carnival. They have increased the number of officers on patrol and they have set up a number of roadblocks to verhindern people from bringing weapons into the area. But the police say that they cannot do it alone. They need the help of the public to make the carnival a safe and enjoyable event. ""We need people to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect themselves,"" said one police officer. ""We also need people to report any suspicious activity to the police."" The police are also urging people to avoid bringing valuables to the carnival. They say that there have been a number of thefts in recent years, and that people should be careful not to leave their belongings unattended.

Paul Kelly, who runs a glazing company in nearby West Calder, said he was ""heartbroken"" to hear about the fire. He said: ""I've been a reptile keeper for over 20 years and I know how much these animals mean to people. ""I can't imagine what it must be like for the staff and volunteers at the zoo to have lost so many of their animals.""

""I'm also happy to donate some of my time and materials to help get the reptile house rebuilt as quickly as possible."" The zoo has launched an appeal to raise funds for the rebuilding of the reptile house. So far, over £100,000 has been raised, but the zoo says it will need much more to complete the project. Mr. Kelly said he hoped his offer of help would encourage others to donate to the appeal. He said: ""I know that money is tight for a lot of people at the moment, but even a small donation would make a big difference. ""The zoo is a vital part of the community and it's important that we all do what we can to help them rebuild.""

Obama London visit: Drones to be banned in the capital,"Drones to be banned in the capital during Obama visit The use of drones will be banned in the capital during US President Barack Obama's visit to London next week, it has been announced. The Metropolitan Police said the ban was being imposed for ""security reasons"" and would be in place from 00:01 BST on Monday 23 April to 23:59 BST on Tuesday 24 April. The ban will apply to all drones, regardless of size or weight. Anyone caught flying a drone during the ban period could face prosecution. The Met said the ban was necessary to ensure the safety and security of the President and the public. ""We are aware that drones are becoming increasingly popular, but their use in the capital during the President's visit could pose a significant security risk,"" a Met spokesman said. ""We are therefore imposing a temporary ban on the use of drones in the capital during this time. We appreciate the cooperation of the public in this matter."" The ban will be enforced by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command. Officers will be patrolling the capital and will be able to seize any drones that are being flown illegally. The ban is likely to cause disruption to some businesses and individuals who use drones for commercial or recreational purposes. However, the Met said the safety of the President and the public was paramount. ""We understand that this ban may cause inconvenience to some people, but we believe it is necessary to ensure the safety of the President and the public,"" the spokesman said. ""We would advise anyone who is planning to fly a drone in the capital during the ban period to reconsider their plans."" The ban is the latest in a series of security measures that have been put in place for the President's visit.

"US planning full Afghan pullout, Obama tells Karzai","US Planning Full Afghan Pullout, Obama Tells Karzai President Barack Obama has informed Afghan President Hamid Karzai that the US is planning a full withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. The move comes after more than 13 years of war in Afghanistan, which has cost the lives of thousands of US soldiers and Afghan civilians. In a phone call on Wednesday, Obama told Karzai that the US would continue to support Afghanistan financially and militarily, but that it was time for the Afghan government to take full responsibility for its own security. ""The United States has been proud to stand with the Afghan people as they rebuild their country and chart a path towards self-reliance,"" Obama said in a statement. ""But ultimately, it is up to the Afghan people to determine their own future."" Karzai said he was ""disappointed"" by Obama's decision, but that he respected the US president's decision. ""We have come a long way since 2001,"" Karzai said. ""We have defeated the Taliban, established a new constitution, and built a new army and police force. But we still have a long way to go."" The US-led invasion of Afghanistan began in 2001, following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The US overthrew the Taliban government, which was harboring al-Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. The US and its allies have been fighting the Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan ever since. The war has been costly, both in terms of human life and financial resources. The US has spent more than $1 trillion on the war in Afghanistan, and more than 2,400 US soldiers have been killed. Thousands of Afghan civilians have also been killed in the conflict. The US began to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 2014, and the withdrawal process is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016. The US will continue to provide financial and military support to Afghanistan after the withdrawal, but it is up to the Afghan government to take full responsibility for its own security. The decision to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan is a significant development in the war. It is a sign that the US is confident that the Afghan government is capable of defending itself against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. However, the withdrawal of US troops also raises concerns about the future of Afghanistan. The Taliban has been gaining ground in recent months, and it is unclear whether the Afghan government will be able to defeat the insurgents without US support.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford denies drug video allegations,"Amidst a storm of controversy, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has vehemently denied allegations that he smoked crack cocaine, as purported in a video reportedly in the possession of two media outlets. The allegations, which first surfaced on Tuesday, have sent shockwaves through the city and raised questions about the mayor's ability to lead. Ford has dismissed the claims as ""ridiculous"" and a ""complete fabrication,"" vowing to take legal action against anyone who spreads them. ""I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,"" Ford said at a hastily called press conference on Thursday. ""I have never smoked crack cocaine."" The mayor's denial comes in the wake of reports that the Toronto Star and Gawker Media have obtained a video that allegedly shows him smoking the illegal substance. Both outlets have refused to release the video, citing legal concerns, but they have maintained that its contents are authentic. The allegations have been met with a mix of disbelief and outrage. Some city councilors have called for Ford to step down if the video is genuine, while others have expressed their support for the mayor and urged him to remain in office. The controversy has overshadowed a series of other scandals that have plagued Ford's administration. In recent months, he has been accused of drunken driving, making homophobic remarks, and associating with known gang members. Despite the allegations, Ford remains a popular figure among some Toronto residents, who credit him with improving the city's finances and reducing crime. However, his approval ratings have declined in recent months, and the latest allegations have further eroded his support. The controversy is likely to continue in the coming days, as the media outlets involved decide whether to release the video and the police investigate the allegations. Ford has promised to cooperate fully with the investigation and has expressed confidence that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. However, even if the video is never released, the allegations are likely to tarnish Ford's reputation and make it difficult for him to continue leading the city. Whether he can weather the storm and remain in office remains to be seen.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

He said that the party would instead focus on ""working with the company to improve services and protect jobs."" The decision has been welcomed by business groups, who have argued that renationalisation would have been bad for the economy. However, it has been criticised by trade unions, who say that it will lead to job losses and worse services. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents postal workers, said that it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Labour's decision. The union said that renationalisation was the only way to protect jobs and services at Royal Mail. The CWU also accused Labour of breaking its promise to the electorate. The party had made a manifesto commitment to renationalise Royal Mail, and the CWU said that it was now ""betraying"" its supporters. Labour's decision to drop its renationalisation pledge is a significant shift in policy. It is a sign that the party is moving away from its traditional left-wing roots and towards a more centrist position. It remains to be seen whether the party's decision will have any impact on its popularity with voters. However, it is clear that the party is taking a risk by dropping a policy that was popular with many of its supporters.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Dangerous dogs: PM urged not to treat pit bulls as 'collateral damage',"Animal welfare groups have urged the Prime Minister not to allow so-called ""dangerous dogs"" to become ""collateral damage"" in the government's plan to tackle violent crime. The plea comes as a consultation on proposed changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 closes on Friday. The government is considering extending the ban to cover more breeds, including the American Bully and Japanese Tosa. But campaigners say there is no evidence that breed-specific legislation is effective in reducing dog attacks. They argue that the focus should be on responsible ownership and education. The RSPCA said: ""We urge the government to not allow the perception of certain breeds as 'dangerous' to become an excuse for inflicting severe and unnecessary penalties on these dogs."" Dogs Trust called for a ""modern, evidence-based approach"" to dog control, arguing that ""breed-specific legislation is not the answer."" The Kennel Club said: ""We are concerned that the proposed changes would be ineffective and unfair. We believe that the focus should be on responsible ownership and education, not on banning specific breeds."" The British Veterinary Association (BVA) said: ""We are concerned that the proposed changes would not be evidence-based and could have unintended consequences."" The government has said that it is ""committed to taking action to ensure that our communities are safe from dangerous dogs."" But animal welfare groups say that the government's proposals are ""misguided"" and will not achieve the desired outcome. They are calling on the Prime Minister to reconsider the plans and to focus on measures that will genuinely reduce dog attacks, such as responsible ownership and education. The consultation on the proposed changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 closes on Friday. The government is expected to announce its decision in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Analysis: What is behind Nissan UK's success?,"Analysis: What is behind Nissan UK's success? Nissan UK has been a major player in the UK automotive industry for decades, and its success has been built on a number of factors. One of the key factors has been Nissan's commitment to manufacturing in the UK. The company has invested heavily in its Sunderland plant, which is now one of the most advanced car factories in Europe. This investment has allowed Nissan to produce high-quality cars at a competitive cost, which has helped to make them popular with UK consumers. Another factor has been Nissan's focus on innovation. The company has been at the forefront of developing new technologies, such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving. This has helped to keep Nissan ahead of the competition and has made its cars more appealing to consumers. In addition to its manufacturing and innovation strengths, Nissan has also benefited from a strong marketing strategy. The company has invested heavily in advertising and has been able to create a strong brand image. This has helped to make Nissan cars more recognizable and desirable to consumers. Finally, Nissan has been able to benefit from the UK government's support for the automotive industry. The government has provided financial assistance to Nissan in the past, and it has also worked to create a favorable regulatory environment for the company. This has helped to make it easier for Nissan to do business in the UK. As a result of these factors, Nissan UK has become one of the most successful car companies in the country. The company has a strong market share and is profitable. It is also a major employer in the UK, and it has helped to create a thriving automotive industry in the North East of England. However, Nissan UK's success is not guaranteed. The company faces a number of challenges, including Brexit, the rise of electric vehicles, and increased competition from other car manufacturers. In order to remain successful, Nissan will need to continue to invest in its UK operations and to adapt to the changing automotive landscape. One of the biggest challenges facing Nissan UK is Brexit. The UK's exit from the European Union could lead to tariffs on cars exported to the EU, which would make Nissan's cars more expensive. This could hurt sales and lead to job losses. Another challenge is the rise of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, and Nissan will need to invest in developing and producing electric cars in order to remain competitive. This is a significant challenge, as electric cars are more expensive to produce than gasoline-powered cars. Finally, Nissan faces increased competition from other car manufacturers. Volkswagen, Toyota, and Hyundai are all major car manufacturers that are competing for market share in the UK. Nissan will need to continue to innovate and offer competitive prices in order to remain successful. Despite these challenges, Nissan UK has a strong foundation on which to build. The company has a strong brand, a loyal customer base, and a commitment to manufacturing in the UK. If Nissan can continue to invest in its UK operations and adapt to the changing automotive landscape, it should be able to remain successful for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Derby staff and students given climate change anxiety therapy,"Climate change is a pressing global issue that has far-reaching implications for our planet and its inhabitants. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the psychological impact of climate change, particularly among young people. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that over half of young people aged 16-25 surveyed in 10 countries reported feeling ""very"" or ""extremely"" worried about climate change. This anxiety can manifest in a variety of ways, including feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and fear. In response to this growing concern, universities and colleges across the UK are starting to offer mental health support specifically tailored to students struggling with climate anxiety. Derby University is one of the latest institutions to launch such a program. The university's Climate Change Anxiety Therapy Service offers free, confidential counseling to students who are feeling anxious or overwhelmed by the climate crisis. The service is staffed by qualified therapists who have been specially trained to help students understand and cope with their climate-related worries. Dr. Emily Whitfield, a clinical psychologist who helped develop the service, said: ""Climate change is a real and urgent threat to our planet and our way of life. It's understandable that young people are feeling anxious about the future, and we want to provide them with the support they need to cope."" The service has been welcomed by students, many of whom have expressed gratitude for the opportunity to talk about their concerns in a safe and supportive environment. One student, who asked not to be named, said: ""I've been feeling really anxious about climate change for a long time, but I didn't know who to talk to about it. This service has been a lifesaver."" The launch of the Climate Change Anxiety Therapy Service at Derby University is a positive step forward in addressing the mental health impacts of climate change. It is hoped that other universities and colleges will follow suit and offer similar services to their students. By providing young people with the support they need to cope with climate anxiety, we can help them to become more resilient and to take action to create a more sustainable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
John Paul II 'set for sainthood' with second miracle,"John Paul II 'set for sainthood' with second miracle Pope John Paul II is set to be made a saint after Pope Francis recognised a second miracle attributed to the late pontiff. The Vatican said the miracle involved the unexplained healing of a Costa Rican woman with a brain aneurysm. It is the second miracle attributed to John Paul II, who died in 2005, and is required for him to be canonised. The first miracle, recognised in 2011, involved the healing of a French nun from Parkinson's disease. Pope Francis is expected to announce the date of John Paul II's canonisation in the coming months. The late pope, who was known as the ""Pilgrim Pope"" for his extensive travels, was a popular figure around the world. He is credited with helping to bring about the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and with promoting interfaith dialogue. John Paul II was also a strong advocate for peace and justice, and he spoke out against poverty and war. The recognition of the second miracle attributed to John Paul II is a significant step in the process of canonisation. Once the date of his canonisation is announced, John Paul II will become the first pope to be made a saint in the 21st century. He will also be the first pope to be canonised during the papacy of his immediate successor. The canonisation of John Paul II is likely to be a major event in the Catholic Church. It is expected to attract millions of pilgrims to Rome and will be a source of great joy for his many followers around the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Chagos Islanders lose court bid,"Chagos Islanders Lose Court Bid to Return Home The Chagos Islanders have lost a legal battle to return to their ancestral homeland, which was forcibly evacuated by the British government in the 1960s. The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the Islanders do not have a legally enforceable right to return to the Chagos Archipelago, which is now a British Overseas Territory and home to a US military base. The Islanders, who were forcibly removed from their homes in the 1960s to make way for the base, have been fighting for decades to return home. They have argued that the eviction was illegal and that they have a right to compensation. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the British government acted lawfully in evicting the Islanders and that there is no legal basis for their return. The ruling is a blow to the Islanders, who have been hoping to return to their homeland for decades. It is also a setback for human rights activists, who have argued that the eviction of the Islanders was a violation of their rights. The British government has said that it will continue to provide support to the Islanders, but it has ruled out the possibility of their return. Background to the Chagos Archipelago The Chagos Archipelago is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean that was once part of the British colony of Mauritius. In 1965, the British government leased the archipelago to the US for use as a military base. The US military base on Diego Garcia, the largest island in the archipelago, is a key strategic asset for the US. It is used for surveillance, communications, and other military operations. The Chagos Islanders were forcibly removed from their homes in the 1960s to make way for the base. The British government has admitted that the eviction was wrong and has apologized for the suffering it caused. However, the British government has refused to allow the Islanders to return home, arguing that it would be too costly and disruptive. Reaction to the Supreme Court Ruling The Supreme Court ruling has been met with disappointment by the Chagos Islanders and their supporters. Olivier Bancoult, the leader of the Chagossians Welfare Association, said that the ruling was ""a travesty of justice."" ""We have been fighting for our right to return home for decades, and now the Supreme Court has told us that we have no right at all,"" he said. Human rights activists have also criticized the ruling, arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent for the forced eviction of indigenous peoples. ""This ruling is a setback for human rights around the world,"" said Amnesty International UK. ""It sends a message that governments can forcibly evict indigenous peoples from their homes with impunity."" The British government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it provides ""legal certainty"" on the issue of the Chagos Islanders. However, the government has also said that it will continue to provide support to the Islanders and that it is committed to finding a ""just and fair"" solution to their plight.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Isle of Wight monolith: Designer claims responsibility for structure,"Isle of Wight Monolith: Designer Claims Responsibility A mysterious monolith that appeared on the Isle of Wight last week has sparked intrigue and speculation, but its designer has now come forward to claim responsibility. James Capper, a 33-year-old artist and designer, told the BBC that he created the monolithic structure as a social experiment. ""I wanted to see how people would react to something unexpected and out of place,"" he said. The monolith, which measures approximately 8 feet tall and 2 feet wide, is made of stainless steel and features an abstract design that has drawn comparisons to the famous monolith from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Capper, who has a history of creating public art installations, said he chose the Isle of Wight because of its remote location. ""I wanted to place it somewhere where it would be hard to ignore but also not so prominent that it would be vandalized immediately,"" he explained. The monolith's appearance sparked a flurry of speculation on social media, with some users suggesting it was an alien artifact or a prank. However, Capper said that the structure was intended as a positive message to inspire creativity and imagination. ""I hope that it makes people think about the world around them,"" he said. ""It's not about being a hoax or a mystery. It's about getting people to ask questions."" The Isle of Wight Council has confirmed that Capper has been given permission to leave the monolith in place for the time being. However, it is unclear how long the structure will remain on display. Capper said that he has no plans to reveal the location of the monolith publicly, hoping that people will continue to search for it and discover it for themselves. ""I want it to be a bit of a treasure hunt,"" he said. The monolith's appearance has reignited the debate about the nature of public art and its role in society. Some critics argue that it is an unwelcome intrusion on the landscape, while others applaud it as a thought-provoking addition to the island's public spaces. Capper said that he is not trying to impose his own interpretation on the monolith but rather wants to leave it open to interpretation. ""It's up to each individual to decide what it means to them,"" he said. ""That's the beauty of art.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The painting, titled ""Legacy,"" was unveiled on January 23, 2023, and has since drawn widespread acclaim for its striking likeness and insightful depiction of Merkel's character. Davidson's portrait presents Merkel with a serene and contemplative expression, her gaze fixed directly at the viewer. The muted colors and understated brushstrokes evoke a sense of quiet strength and determination, reflecting Merkel's renowned pragmatism and unwavering commitment to her principles. The composition also captures the iconic diamond-shaped neckline of Merkel's signature red blazer, an element that has become synonymous with her powerful and authoritative presence. For Davidson, the opportunity to paint Merkel was both an honor and a challenge. ""I wanted to create an image that would not only capture her likeness but also convey the profound impact she has had on the global stage,"" he said in an interview with Time magazine. ""Merkel is a remarkable figure, and I believe that my painting offers a glimpse into the essence of her character and legacy.""

Vietnam accuses China in seas dispute,"Vietnam has accused China of violating its sovereignty after its survey ship entered disputed waters in the South China Sea. The Chinese vessel, Haiyang Dizhi 8, entered Vietnam's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on Monday and has been conducting a survey since then, according to Vietnam's foreign ministry. Vietnam's foreign ministry has sent a diplomatic note to China, protesting the incursion and demanding that the vessel leave the area immediately. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between Vietnam and China over the South China Sea. China claims the majority of the sea, while Vietnam, along with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, also claim parts of it. The South China Sea is a vital waterway for trade and is believed to be rich in oil and gas reserves. In recent years, China has been building artificial islands in the sea and increasing its military presence there, raising concerns among other countries in the region. Vietnam has repeatedly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and has called on the international community to support its position. In a statement on Tuesday, Vietnam's foreign ministry said that China's survey vessel ""has been illegally conducting seismic surveys in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf."" ""This act constitutes a serious violation of Vietnam's sovereignty and sovereign rights over its maritime zones, as defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" the statement said.

BA pilots vote in favour of strike action over key summer period,"BA Pilots Vote in Favour of Strike Action Over Crucial Summer Period British Airways (BA) pilots have voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action, threatening widespread disruption during the peak summer holiday season. The ballot, conducted by the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA), saw 93% of participating pilots back strike action over a longstanding pay dispute. The strike, if it goes ahead, could potentially ground BA flights across the UK and Europe from as early as the end of July. The exact timing and duration of the action are yet to be confirmed, but it is expected to have a significant impact on travel plans for thousands of passengers. BALPA has been locked in negotiations with BA management over a new pay deal for several months, but the two sides have failed to reach an agreement. The union argues that BA pilots have not received a pay rise in real terms for several years and are now significantly underpaid compared to their counterparts at other major airlines. BA has expressed disappointment at the ballot result and has urged BALPA to return to negotiations. The airline has said that it is committed to offering a fair pay settlement, but that it must also balance the interests of its shareholders and customers. The strike vote comes at a critical time for the aviation industry, which is still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. BA has already been forced to cancel thousands of flights this summer due to staff shortages and other operational issues. A strike by pilots would further exacerbate these challenges and could cause widespread chaos for passengers. The government has called on both sides to come to a compromise and avoid a strike. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that the government was ""deeply concerned"" about the potential impact of the action and urged BA and BALPA to ""work together to find a solution that is in the best interests of the traveling public."" Passengers who have booked BA flights over the coming months are advised to check the airline's website for updates on the strike situation. BA has said that it will be offering affected passengers the option to rebook or cancel their flights free of charge. The strike vote is a major blow to BA and could have severe consequences for the airline's reputation and financial performance. It is hoped that a compromise can be reached before the planned strike date, but the standoff between BA and BALPA remains a source of significant uncertainty for passengers and the aviation industry as a whole.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
May seeks 'new chapter' in Gulf relations ahead of Bahrain visit,"Theresa May will call for a ""new chapter"" in relations with the Gulf states when she visits Bahrain on Wednesday. The Prime Minister will say that the UK wants to work with its allies in the region to address ""common threats"", including terrorism, extremism and climate change. She will also stress the importance of free trade and investment, and say that the UK is committed to being a ""reliable partner"" in the Gulf. May's visit comes at a time of heightened tensions in the region. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the allegations. The UK has been trying to mediate in the dispute, but so far without success. May is expected to use her visit to Bahrain to urge all sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. In her speech, May is likely to say that the UK has a ""long-standing friendship"" with the Gulf states, and that she wants to build on that relationship in the years to come. She is expected to say: ""We want to work together to address the common threats we face, such as terrorism, extremism and climate change. We want to work together to promote free trade and investment. And we want to work together to build a more stable and prosperous region."" May's visit to Bahrain is part of a wider tour of the Gulf. She has already visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and will also travel to Oman and Kuwait. The Prime Minister's visit is seen as an important opportunity to strengthen the UK's relationship with the Gulf states. The UK is keen to maintain its influence in the region, and to ensure that its businesses have access to the Gulf's vast oil and gas reserves. However, May's visit is also likely to be overshadowed by the ongoing diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbors. The UK has been trying to mediate in the dispute, but so far without success. It is unclear whether May will be able to make any progress on this issue during her visit to Bahrain.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Jon Snow and Nigel Farage cleared by Ofcom over Brexit rally remarks,"Ofcom has cleared Jon Snow and Nigel Farage of any wrongdoing over remarks they made at a Brexit rally. The media watchdog launched an investigation following complaints about comments made by the Channel 4 News presenter and the former Ukip leader at a Leave.EU event in March 2019. Snow had said that the UK was ""a country that has been raped by uncontrolled immigration"" and that ""we are going to be invaded by 70 million Turks"". Farage had said that the UK was ""full"" and that ""we need to get our country back"". Ofcom received 3,153 complaints about the event, including 1,539 about Snow's comments and 1,614 about Farage's. The watchdog said it had considered whether the comments were likely to incite hatred or violence against any group of people. It concluded that they did not meet the threshold for a breach of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code. Ofcom said: ""We considered whether the comments made by Jon Snow and Nigel Farage at the Leave.EU rally were likely to incite hatred or violence against any group of people. ""We concluded that they did not meet the threshold for a breach of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code."" The watchdog added that it had taken into account the context in which the comments were made, the fact that they were not directed at any specific group of people, and the fact that they did not contain any explicit calls for violence. Ofcom's decision is likely to be welcomed by Snow and Farage, who have both defended their comments. Snow has said that he was simply ""reflecting the concerns of many people"" about immigration, while Farage has said that he was ""simply stating the facts"" about the UK's population. However, the decision is likely to be criticized by those who believe that the comments were racist and xenophobic. The Stop Hate UK campaign group said that Ofcom's decision was ""deeply disappointing"" and that it ""sends a message that hate speech is acceptable"". The group added: ""We believe that Jon Snow and Nigel Farage's comments were clearly racist and xenophobic and that they should have been held to account for them.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nintendo posts larger than expected loss despite Mario Kart,"Nintendo has announced a larger-than-expected operating loss of 425 billion yen ($3.6 billion) for the fiscal year ended March 2023, despite the strong performance of its popular racing game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The loss was driven by a decline in sales of the Nintendo Switch console, which has been on the market for over six years, and a slowdown in demand for its games. Nintendo's net sales for the year fell by 5.6% to 1.6 trillion yen ($13.6 billion), while its operating profit plunged by 62.4% to 249 billion yen ($2.1 billion). The company sold 18.9 million Switch consoles during the fiscal year, down from 23 million in the previous year. Sales of Switch games also declined, with only 172 million units sold, compared to 235 million in the previous year. Despite the overall decline, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continued to perform well, selling 11.8 million copies during the fiscal year, bringing its total sales to over 52 million units since its launch in 2017. Nintendo attributed the decline in sales to a number of factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and consumer spending, as well as the aging of the Switch console. The company said it is working on new products and services to address the challenges it is facing and is confident in its long-term prospects. Analysts had expected Nintendo to post an operating loss of around 350 billion yen ($3 billion), so the actual loss was larger than anticipated. The loss is the first for Nintendo since the fiscal year ended March 2012, when it reported a loss of 20 billion yen ($170 million). Nintendo's share price fell by 5% in Tokyo trading on Friday following the announcement of the loss. The company is scheduled to release its next major game, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, in May 2023. Analysts will be watching closely to see if the game can help Nintendo to turn around its fortunes.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
USS John S McCain: Navy sacks officers over collision,"USS John S McCain: Navy sacks officers over collision The US Navy has sacked the commanding officer of the guided-missile destroyer USS John S McCain and nine other senior officers after an investigation into a deadly collision with a merchant ship. The destroyer collided with the Alnic MC off the coast of Singapore last August, killing 10 sailors. The investigation found that a series of failures, including poor leadership and a lack of training, contributed to the crash. The Navy said that Captain Alfredo J. Sanchez, the ship's commanding officer, had been relieved of his duties for ""loss of confidence in his ability to command."" Nine other officers, including the executive officer and the chief engineer, were also relieved of their duties or reassigned. The Navy said that the officers had failed to maintain proper watch and had not taken corrective action when the ship was on a collision course with the Alnic MC. The investigation also found that the ship's crew had not been properly trained in collision avoidance procedures. The Navy said that it was implementing a number of reforms to improve safety on its ships, including increasing training and improving watch procedures. The collision was the fourth major accident involving a US Navy ship in the Pacific in the past two years. In 2017, the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan, killing seven sailors. In the same year, the USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing boat, injuring 17 sailors. And in June 2019, the USS Antietam collided with a Japanese fishing boat, injuring two sailors. The Navy has come under increasing pressure to improve safety on its ships after the series of accidents. The Navy said that it was committed to improving safety and that it would take all necessary steps to prevent future accidents. The families of the sailors who died in the collision have welcomed the Navy's decision to sack the officers. The father of one of the victims said that he was ""glad that the Navy is finally taking responsibility for what happened."" He said that he hoped that the Navy's reforms would help to prevent future accidents.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: German zoo may have to feed animals to each other,"In a desperate bid to survive, a German zoo may be forced to feed its animals to each other in order to cope with the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany is facing a severe cash shortage after being closed to visitors for months. Without the income from ticket sales, the zoo is struggling to cover the costs of feeding its 700 animals. Zoo director Verena Kaspari said that the zoo is ""on the brink of collapse"" and that they may have to make the ""unthinkable"" decision to feed some animals to others. ""We have already had to reduce the amount of food we give to the animals,"" Kaspari said. ""But if we don't find a way to generate more income, we will have no choice but to start feeding the animals to each other."" The zoo is home to a variety of animals, including lions, tigers, bears, elephants, and monkeys. Kaspari said that the zoo would start by feeding the smaller animals to the larger ones. ""It's a terrible thing to contemplate,"" Kaspari said. ""But we have to do what we have to do to survive."" The zoo has launched an emergency fundraising campaign in an attempt to raise the money needed to avoid having to feed the animals to each other. ""We are asking for the public's help,"" Kaspari said. ""We need donations to keep the zoo open and to feed our animals. Please help us to save our zoo."" The zoo has received some donations, but it is still far short of what is needed. Kaspari said that the zoo needs to raise at least €500,000 in order to survive. ""We are grateful for any donation, no matter how small,"" Kaspari said. ""Every little bit helps."" The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on zoos around the world. Many zoos have been forced to close to visitors, and they are struggling to cope with the loss of income.

Kevin Bennett killing: Three boys guilty of murder,"Three boys have been found guilty of murdering Kevin Bennett, 17, in a park in Essex. The defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the killing, admitted manslaughter but denied murder. A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court found them guilty of murder following a five-week trial. The court heard how Kevin was attacked in Colchester's High Woods Country Park on 14 July last year. He suffered multiple stab wounds and died at the scene. The three defendants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were among a group of six or seven who chased Kevin and his friends. The court heard how the group was armed with knives and a machete. The jury was told that Kevin was stabbed in the back, chest and legs. He also suffered a fractured skull. The prosecution said that the defendants had intended to kill Kevin, while the defence argued that they had only intended to cause him serious harm. In a statement after the verdict, Kevin's family said they were ""relieved"" that the defendants had been found guilty of murder. They said: ""We are relieved that the jury has reached a verdict of guilty. This has been an incredibly difficult time for us all, but we hope that this verdict will bring us some closure."" Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: ""This was a senseless and brutal attack on a young man who had his whole life ahead of him. ""The defendants have shown no remorse for their actions and they deserve to spend a long time in prison."" The three defendants will be sentenced at a later date. The trial heard how the defendants had been drinking and taking drugs on the day of the killing. They had also been involved in a number of fights in the park in the days leading up to the attack.

Mitsubishi Motors shares untraded in Japan due to sell orders,"Mitsubishi Motors Shares Untraded in Japan Due to Sell Orders Shares of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. were halted from trading in Japan on Thursday due to a glut of sell orders, following reports that the automaker may face a fine of up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) from the European Union. The European Commission is investigating allegations that Mitsubishi Motors used software to cheat on emissions tests for its diesel vehicles. The company has admitted to using the software and has already been fined by regulators in Japan and South Korea. The halt in trading came after Mitsubishi Motors' shares fell by more than 15% in early trading on Thursday. The company said it had requested the halt in order to prevent further volatility in its share price. The European Commission is expected to announce its decision on the fine later this month. If the fine is as large as reported, it would be a significant blow to Mitsubishi Motors, which has been struggling to recover from the emissions scandal. The company has already recalled more than 600,000 vehicles worldwide and has suspended sales of its diesel vehicles in Europe. The scandal has also damaged Mitsubishi Motors' reputation and has led to the resignation of its chairman and CEO. The halt in trading is likely to continue until the European Commission announces its decision on the fine. Mitsubishi Motors said it would update the market as soon as it had more information. The emissions scandal has had a significant impact on the Japanese auto industry. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have both been fined by regulators for using similar software to cheat on emissions tests. The scandal has also raised questions about the effectiveness of emissions regulations in Japan and Europe. Regulators in both regions are now reviewing their testing procedures and are considering new measures to prevent future cheating. The Mitsubishi Motors scandal is a reminder that the auto industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce emissions. Regulators around the world are cracking down on cheating and are demanding that automakers develop cleaner vehicles. The auto industry is also facing competition from new technologies, such as electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Automakers that fail to adapt to these changes may find themselves struggling to compete in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Llangattock hydro power plan raises £270,000 in share offer","Llangattock Hydro Power Plant Raises £270,000 in Share Offer The Llangattock hydro power plant in the Brecon Beacons has raised £270,000 in a share offer, bringing the total raised to £1.1 million. The money will be used to complete the construction of the plant, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2023. Once complete, the plant will generate enough electricity to power 2,000 homes. The share offer was launched in May 2022 and has attracted investment from over 400 people. The minimum investment was £250, with a maximum of £10,000. The plant is being developed by Llangattock Hydro Ltd, a not-for-profit company. The company's aim is to provide renewable energy to the community and to create local jobs. The plant is located on a former mill site on the River Usk. The water will be diverted through a turbine to generate electricity. The electricity will then be fed into the National Grid. The plant is expected to have a lifespan of over 50 years. It is estimated that the plant will save 1,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year. The share offer was oversubscribed, with demand for shares exceeding the amount available. This shows the strong support for the project from the local community. The project has also received support from the Welsh Government, which has provided a grant of £150,000. The Llangattock hydro power plant is a major investment in renewable energy in Wales. The plant will generate clean, green electricity for the community and will help to reduce carbon emissions.

Labour's Kate Osamor resigns as shadow minister,"Labour's Kate Osamor resigns as shadow minister amid bullying allegations Kate Osamor, the Labour MP for Edmonton, has resigned as shadow international development minister after she was accused of bullying a member of her staff. The allegations were made in a letter from the staff member to Labour's chief whip, Nick Brown. The letter, which has been seen by the BBC, alleges that Ms Osamor made ""repeated and sustained"" attempts to undermine and belittle the staff member. Ms Osamor has denied the allegations, but she has said she is standing down from her shadow cabinet role to ""clear her name"". In a statement, she said: ""I am deeply disappointed to have to resign from my position as shadow international development minister. However, I believe that it is the right thing to do in the circumstances. ""I want to make it clear that I absolutely deny the allegations that have been made against me. I have always behaved professionally and respectfully towards my staff. ""I am confident that I will be able to clear my name and I look forward to returning to my shadow cabinet role as soon as possible."" A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party takes all allegations of bullying very seriously. We are investigating the allegations that have been made against Kate Osamor and we will take appropriate action if necessary."" Ms Osamor's resignation comes at a time when Labour is facing a number of allegations of bullying and harassment. In recent weeks, two Labour MPs have been suspended from the party over allegations of sexual harassment. The party has also been criticized for its handling of anti-Semitism complaints. Last week, the former Labour MP Luciana Berger quit the party, saying that she had been subjected to ""relentless bullying, harassment and intimidation"" by members and supporters of the party. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that he is ""determined to root out"" bullying and harassment from the party.

Gene therapy 'treats' Parkinson's disease,"Gene Therapy Offers New Hope for Parkinson's Patients A groundbreaking gene therapy treatment has shown promising results in treating Parkinson's disease, offering new hope for patients who have long struggled with the debilitating effects of the condition. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain, which is responsible for controlling movement. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with balance. Traditional treatments for Parkinson's disease focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. However, gene therapy offers the potential to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing or replacing damaged or lost brain cells. In a recent clinical trial, researchers used a gene therapy technique called adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer to deliver a gene encoding for the dopamine transporter (DAT) protein into the striatum, a brain region affected in Parkinson's disease. The DAT protein is responsible for transporting dopamine into neurons, which allows the neurotransmitter to transmit signals between nerve cells. By introducing a functional DAT protein, the researchers hoped to restore dopamine signaling and improve motor function in Parkinson's patients. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging. Patients who received the gene therapy experienced significant improvements in motor function, including reduced tremor, increased mobility, and improved balance. The improvements were sustained for up to 3 years, suggesting a long-term benefit of the treatment. The researchers believe that gene therapy could become a valuable new tool for treating Parkinson's disease. By replacing lost or damaged dopamine-producing cells, the therapy has the potential to not only manage symptoms but also halt or slow down the progression of the disease. Further research is needed to optimize the gene therapy approach and assess its long-term safety and efficacy. However, the early success of this clinical trial provides a beacon of hope for Parkinson's patients and their families, suggesting that a potential cure for this life-changing condition may be within reach.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Don't weep for old economic targets,"In the wake of last week's disappointing GDP figures, there have been calls for a return to the old economic targets of growth, inflation, and unemployment. However, such a move would be a mistake. The old economic targets were based on an outdated understanding of how the economy works. Growth is not the only measure of economic success, and inflation and unemployment are not always the best indicators of economic health. In fact, the old economic targets can sometimes be counterproductive. For example, a focus on growth can lead to unsustainable levels of debt and environmental degradation. A focus on inflation can lead to interest rate hikes that slow down economic growth. And a focus on unemployment can lead to policies that make it harder for people to find jobs. The new economic targets should focus on creating a more sustainable and equitable economy. This means focusing on measures such as: Well-being: This measure takes into account not only economic factors but also social and environmental factors. Job creation: This measure focuses on creating good-paying jobs that provide people with financial security. Wage growth: This measure focuses on increasing wages for all workers, not just those at the top. Productivity: This measure focuses on improving the efficiency of the economy so that we can produce more goods and services with fewer resources. Environmental sustainability: This measure focuses on reducing the economy's impact on the environment. These new economic targets are more in line with the challenges that we face today. They represent a shift away from the old, growth-at-all-costs mentality to a more sustainable and equitable approach to economic development. Of course, achieving these new economic targets will not be easy. It will require a fundamental shift in the way that we think about the economy. But it is a shift that is necessary if we want to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all. In the meantime, we should not weep for the old economic targets. They were based on an outdated understanding of how the economy works, and they are no longer relevant to the challenges that we face today.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

"Swiss immigration: 50.3% back quotas, final results show","Swiss immigration: 50.3% back quotas, final results show The final results of the referendum on immigration quotas in Switzerland have been released, with 50.3% of voters backing the proposal. The vote, which took place on Sunday, was closely fought, with 49.7% of voters rejecting the quotas. Turnout was high, with 64.4% of eligible voters casting their ballots. The quotas will limit the number of residence permits issued to citizens of the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to 1% of the Swiss population. This would mean that around 24,000 permits would be issued each year. The Swiss People's Party (SVP), which campaigned for the quotas, said the result was a ""victory for Switzerland"". The party's leader, Christoph Blocher, said the quotas would ""protect Swiss wages and jobs"". However, opponents of the quotas said they would damage the Swiss economy. They argued that the quotas would make it harder for businesses to recruit skilled workers from the EU and EFTA. The Swiss government has said it will now start work on implementing the quotas. However, it is likely to face legal challenges from the EU and EFTA. The referendum on immigration quotas is the latest in a series of votes in Switzerland on the issue of immigration. In 2014, voters backed a proposal to introduce quotas on immigration from the EU. However, that proposal was later rejected by the Swiss parliament. The issue of immigration is a divisive one in Switzerland. Some voters are concerned about the impact of immigration on Swiss culture and identity. Others argue that immigration is essential for the Swiss economy.

Australian man found after two weeks stranded in outback,"In a remarkable tale of survival, an Australian man has been found alive and well after spending two weeks stranded in the vast and unforgiving outback. 36-year-old Tom George set out on a solo camping trip in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia on 16th December. However, his vehicle became bogged in a creek, leaving him stranded and without communication. Undeterred, George rationed the meager supplies he had with him, including water and food. He also slept in his car to protect himself from the scorching sun and extreme temperatures. As days turned into nights, George's hope began to dwindle. Meanwhile, his family and friends back home were desperately worried. They had not heard from him for several days and feared the worst. They alerted the authorities, who launched a large-scale search operation involving land, air, and water resources. On Friday, after two weeks of searching, a helicopter spotted George's vehicle from the air. A rescue team was immediately deployed and found him alive and surprisingly well-hydrated. ""I was so relieved to see them,"" said George, his voice trembling with emotion. ""I thought I was going to die out there."" George was immediately flown to a hospital for a medical checkup and was found to be in good physical condition. He attributed his survival to his determination and the knowledge he had acquired from years of bushcrafting. ""I knew that if I panicked, I would only make things worse,"" said George. ""I focused on staying calm and rationed my supplies carefully."" George's story has captured the attention of the nation, highlighting the resilience and resourcefulness of Australians in the face of adversity. It has also raised awareness of the dangers of venturing into remote areas alone and the importance of being prepared for emergencies. As George recovers from his ordeal, he is thankful for the support of his family and the unwavering efforts of the rescue team. He plans to return to the outback one day but with a more extensive communication system and increased supplies.

One film shows a young woman working from home while looking after her young children. Another shows an elderly couple using video calls to stay in touch with their family. The campaign is designed to remind people of the importance of staying at home to help stop the spread of the virus. The message The message of the campaign is clear: ""Keep going. Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives."" The campaign is part of a wider government effort to encourage people to follow the lockdown rules. The impact The campaign has been praised by many for its positive message and its focus on the resilience of the British people. However, some have criticized the campaign for being too simplistic and for not addressing the real challenges that people are facing during lockdown. Despite the criticism, the campaign is likely to have a significant impact on public behavior. The evidence There is evidence to suggest that advertising campaigns can be effective in changing people's behavior. For example, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a public health campaign to promote handwashing led to a significant increase in handwashing rates.

Hundreds of peregrine falcons kept secret 'for safety',"In a covert operation aimed at safeguarding one of the UK's most iconic birds of prey, hundreds of peregrine falcons have been secretly held in captivity for their own protection. Conservationists have been discreetly breeding and releasing peregrine falcons into the wild over the past three decades, with remarkable success. The species, once on the brink of extinction in Britain, has now rebounded to healthy numbers. However, the birds face a persistent threat from illegal persecution, including poisoning, trapping, and nest robbing. To mitigate this, the secretive breeding program was initiated, with the birds housed in undisclosed locations. ""We can't reveal the locations where the falcons are kept, as this could put them at risk,"" explained a spokesperson from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). ""We take the safety of these birds extremely seriously."" The breeding program has been a collaborative effort involving the RSPB, the National Trust, Natural England, and other conservation organizations. Birds are carefully selected for breeding based on their genetic diversity and health, ensuring the long-term viability of the population. Once the falcons reach maturity, they are released into areas where they are known to have historically nested. The birds are fitted with tracking devices to monitor their movements and survival rates. The program has been met with mixed reactions. Some conservationists argue that keeping the falcons captive undermines their natural instincts and reduces their chances of survival in the wild. Others maintain that the secrecy is essential to protect the birds from persecution. ""We understand the concerns that people have, but we believe that this program is the best way to protect peregrine falcons in the UK,"" said the RSPB spokesperson. ""We want to see these birds thriving once again, and we're confident that this program will help us achieve that goal."" The secrecy surrounding the breeding program is a testament to the ongoing challenges faced by peregrine falcons. Despite their protected status, these birds remain vulnerable to human activities. By keeping the locations of the breeding facilities secret, conservationists hope to ensure the survival of this majestic raptor for future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Security forces quickly arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area. They engaged in a fierce gun battle with the attackers, who were holed up inside the hotel. The fighting lasted for several hours before security forces regained control of the building. All guests and staff were evacuated from the hotel, and authorities have launched an investigation into the attack. No group has yet claimed responsibility. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and ordered an immediate investigation. He also directed authorities to provide the best possible medical treatment to the injured. Balochistan has been plagued by violence for decades, with separatist and Islamist militant groups operating in the region. The province is also a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major infrastructure project that has been targeted by militants in the past. The attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel is a stark reminder of the security challenges facing Pakistan. The country has been grappling with a wave of terrorism in recent years, and the government has struggled to contain the violence. The international community has condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the people of Pakistan. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries have offered their support in the investigation and the fight against terrorism. The attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel is a tragedy that has claimed the lives of innocent people. It is a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Pakistan and the need for the international community to work together to combat this scourge.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
We rely on migrants to produce your food - young farmers,"Young farmers in the UK have warned that the country will struggle to produce enough food in the future without migrant workers. They say that a shortage of British workers willing to do the physically demanding and often low-paid work of farming means that the industry is increasingly reliant on people from overseas. In a new report, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) found that 56% of fruit and vegetable farms in the UK now employ non-UK workers. The NFU said that without these workers, the UK would not be able to produce enough food to feed its population. ""We rely on migrants to produce your food,"" said NFU President Minette Batters. ""Without them, we would not be able to put food on the shelves."" The NFU's report found that the number of non-UK workers in the UK agricultural sector has increased by 10% in the past year. The report also found that the average age of a farmer in the UK is 59, and that the number of young people entering the industry is declining. The NFU said that the government needs to do more to encourage young people to take up farming. ""We need to make farming more attractive to young people,"" said Batters. ""We need to invest in training and education, and we need to make sure that there are affordable opportunities for young people to get into farming."" The government has said that it is committed to supporting the agricultural sector. ""We are working closely with the NFU and other stakeholders to address the challenges facing the industry,"" said a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). ""We are committed to ensuring that the UK has a sustainable and resilient agricultural sector, and that we can continue to produce enough food to feed our population."" However, the NFU said that the government needs to do more to address the shortage of young farmers. ""We need the government to take urgent action to address this issue,"" said Batters. ""If we don't, we will not be able to produce enough food in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US economic growth revision to 3.7% boosts markets,"US economic growth revised to 3.7%, boosting markets The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the second quarter of 2023, according to revised data from the Commerce Department. This is up from the previous estimate of 2.9%. The upward revision was largely due to stronger consumer spending and business investment. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of US economic activity, rose at an annualised rate of 2.8% in the second quarter, up from the previous estimate of 1.8%. Business investment rose at an annualised rate of 8.3%, up from the previous estimate of 5.7%. The revised data is a positive sign for the US economy. It suggests that the economy is growing at a faster pace than previously thought and that the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing. The news of the revised economic growth data has boosted markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by more than 300 points on the day of the announcement, and the S&P 500 index rose by more than 1%. The revised economic growth data is also likely to have implications for the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. The Fed has been raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. However, the revised economic growth data suggests that the economy may be able to withstand higher interest rates without slowing down too much. This could give the Fed more room to raise rates in the future if inflation remains high. Overall, the revised US economic growth data is a positive sign for the economy and for markets.

Aurigny Air Services could be sold to Blue Islands,"Aurigny Air Services could be sold to Blue Islands Aurigny Air Services, the Guernsey-based airline, is in talks to be sold to Blue Islands, a Channel Islands-based carrier. The move, which could be announced as early as next week, would create a new regional airline with a combined fleet of 14 aircraft and a network spanning the Channel Islands, the UK and France. Aurigny has been struggling financially in recent years, and the sale to Blue Islands would provide it with much-needed capital. Blue Islands, meanwhile, is keen to expand its operations and sees Aurigny as a strategic fit. The deal would be subject to regulatory approval, but it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. If the sale goes ahead, it would be the latest in a series of consolidations in the regional airline industry. In recent years, a number of small airlines have been acquired by larger carriers, as the industry seeks to achieve economies of scale and improve efficiency. The sale of Aurigny to Blue Islands would be a significant development for the Channel Islands. Aurigny is the largest airline operating from Guernsey, and its sale would leave the island with only one remaining scheduled carrier, Flybe. The deal could also have implications for air fares in the region. Blue Islands is known for its low-cost fares, and it is likely that it would introduce similar fares on Aurigny's routes. However, there are also concerns that the sale could lead to a reduction in competition and a decline in service. Aurigny has a good reputation for customer service, and some passengers may be concerned that this will be compromised under Blue Islands ownership. Overall, the sale of Aurigny to Blue Islands is a significant development for the Channel Islands. It is too early to say what the full implications of the deal will be, but it is likely to have a major impact on air travel in the region. Reaction The news of the proposed sale has been met with mixed reactions. Some passengers have welcomed the potential for lower fares, while others are concerned about the loss of competition and the potential impact on service. The Guernsey government has said that it will work with both airlines to ensure that the sale is in the best interests of the island. Aurigny and Blue Islands have both declined to comment on the proposed sale.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US election: Biden pledges billions to improve racial equality,"In an effort to address systemic racial inequality in the United States, President Joe Biden has unveiled a sweeping plan to invest billions of dollars in communities of color. The initiative, unveiled in a speech at the National Urban League's annual conference, outlines a comprehensive strategy to tackle disparities in housing, education, healthcare, and economic opportunity. Biden's plan commits to investing $100 billion in affordable housing, creating millions of new homeowners and strengthening communities that have historically faced discrimination in housing. The plan also includes $50 billion for K-12 public education, with a focus on improving teacher diversity and increasing access to quality education for students of color. In terms of healthcare, the plan proposes investing $20 billion to expand access to affordable healthcare, reduce maternal mortality rates, and address health disparities that disproportionately impact minority communities. The plan also includes measures to address racial profiling and excessive use of force by law enforcement, with a focus on investing in community policing and implicit bias training. Biden emphasized the importance of creating an economy that works for everyone, regardless of race, by pledging to invest $100 billion in minority-owned businesses and entrepreneurs. The plan also includes measures to expand access to capital, provide technical assistance, and create mentorship opportunities for businesses owned by people of color. The President acknowledged that racial inequality is a deeply ingrained issue in American society, but expressed optimism that his plan can make a meaningful difference. He emphasized the need for unity and collaboration among all Americans to overcome these challenges and build a more just and equitable society for all. Biden's plan has been met with praise from civil rights leaders and advocates for racial justice. However, some critics have argued that the plan does not go far enough and that more needs to be done to address the root causes of racial inequality. The implementation of Biden's plan will be a complex and challenging undertaking, but it represents a significant step towards addressing racial inequality in the United States. The plan's success will depend on sustained investment, ongoing collaboration, and a commitment to creating a more just and equitable society for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Single-use coffee cups ban in Scottish government buildings,"Single-use coffee cups banned in Scottish government buildings In a bid to reduce waste and protect the environment, the Scottish government has announced a ban on single-use coffee cups in all its buildings. The ban, which comes into effect on 1st June 2023, will apply to all government offices, schools, and hospitals. It is estimated that the ban will prevent around 100 million single-use coffee cups from being used each year. Single-use coffee cups are a major source of waste. They are often made from plastic, which can take hundreds of years to decompose. Even those made from paper are often lined with plastic, which makes them difficult to recycle. The Scottish government's ban is part of a wider effort to reduce waste and promote sustainability. The government has already introduced a number of other measures, including a ban on plastic straws and a levy on plastic bags. The ban on single-use coffee cups has been welcomed by environmental groups. Friends of the Earth Scotland said the ban was a ""positive step"" and called on other organizations to follow suit. ""Single-use coffee cups are a huge source of waste,"" said Sarah Moyes, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth Scotland. ""They are often made from plastic, which can take hundreds of years to decompose. Even those made from paper are often lined with plastic, which makes them difficult to recycle."" ""This ban is a welcome step in the right direction. We hope that other organizations will follow suit and help to reduce the amount of waste we produce."" The Scottish government's ban is the latest in a number of measures being taken around the world to reduce waste and promote sustainability. In 2018, the European Union banned the sale of single-use plastic straws, cutlery, and plates. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, have also introduced levies on plastic bags.

Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, has been flooded with posts praising the launch and expressing excitement for future space exploration missions. Many netizens have shared photos and videos of the launch, accompanied by patriotic hashtags such as #ChinaSpace and #Tiangong2.

Douglas Carswell: Grandparents 'need more of a say' in adoptions,"Douglas Carswell: Grandparents 'need more of a say' in adoptions Former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell has called for grandparents to have a greater say in adoption decisions. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Carswell said that grandparents were often ""the most stable and loving people in a child's life"" and that they should be given more consideration when it came to adoption. He said: ""Grandparents are often the most stable and loving people in a child's life. They have a wealth of experience and wisdom to offer, and they can provide a loving and supportive home for a child in need."" Mr Carswell's comments come as the government prepares to introduce a new Adoption and Children Act. The act is intended to make it easier for children to be adopted and to reduce the number of children who are in care. However, Mr Carswell said that the act did not go far enough in giving grandparents a say in adoption decisions. He said that grandparents should have the right to be assessed as potential adopters and that they should be given priority over other applicants. He said: ""Grandparents have a natural right to be involved in the lives of their grandchildren. They should not be discriminated against simply because they are not the child's biological parents."" Mr Carswell's comments have been welcomed by some grandparents' rights groups. However, they have also been criticized by some adoption agencies, who say that the focus should be on finding the best possible home for a child, regardless of the relationship between the child and the potential adopters. A spokesperson for the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said: ""The most important thing is to find the best possible home for a child. That means looking at all the potential adopters, including grandparents, and making a decision based on what is in the best interests of the child."" The government has said that it will consider Mr Carswell's proposals as part of its review of the Adoption and Children Act.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Kanhaiya Kumar: 'Sedition' student returns to JNU with fiery speech,"Amidst the clamorous atmosphere of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Kanhaiya Kumar, the former student leader who became a symbol of political dissent in India, delivered a fiery speech upon his return to the campus after a gap of four years. Kumar, who was charged with sedition in 2016 for allegedly raising anti-national slogans on campus, spent nine months in prison before being acquitted by the Delhi High Court in 2019. The charges sparked widespread protests and ignited a national debate on freedom of expression in India. Addressing a packed crowd of students and supporters, Kumar launched a scathing attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, accusing it of suppressing dissent and muzzling free speech. ""The BJP government is using the sedition law as a weapon to crush any voice of opposition,"" he thundered. ""I was jailed for raising slogans against the government, but those who killed Mahatma Gandhi and spread violence in Gujarat roam free,"" he said, referring to the assassination of India's independence icon and the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which thousands of Muslims were killed. Kumar also criticized the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing it of failing to protect the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Indians. ""The government has failed to provide vaccines, oxygen, and basic medical care to our people,"" he said. ""This is not the India we fought for,"" Kumar added. ""We fought for a country where everyone has the right to express their views, where justice is equal for all, and where the government serves the people."" Kumar's speech was met with thunderous applause and chants of ""azadi"" (freedom). He urged the students to unite against the ""fascist"" BJP government and continue their fight for justice and equality. ""The battle for our freedom is far from over,"" he said. ""We must stand together, raise our voices, and demand a better India for all."" Kumar's return to JNU and his fiery speech have reignited the debate on sedition in India. The colonial-era law, which criminalizes any speech or expression that brings hatred or disaffection towards the government, has been widely criticized for being vague and open to misuse. Critics argue that the law has been used selectively to target political opponents and stifle dissent, particularly in recent years under the BJP government. They call for its repeal or amendment to ensure that it is not used to suppress legitimate criticism of the government. The government, however, has defended the sedition law, arguing that it is necessary to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the nation. It maintains that the law is only applied in cases where there is clear evidence of incitement to violence or hatred against the government.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Trump chooses pro-settlement hardliner as Israel envoy,"President Donald Trump has nominated David Friedman, a prominent bankruptcy lawyer and supporter of Israeli settlements, as the next US ambassador to Israel. Friedman, who helped negotiate the four bankruptcies of Trump's casinos, is a close adviser to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. He is also a strong supporter of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law and are seen as a major obstacle to peace negotiations. Friedman's nomination has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed his appointment, saying that his close ties to the Trump administration will help to strengthen the US-Israel relationship. Others have expressed concern about his views on settlements, saying that he will be unable to play the role of an impartial mediator in peace negotiations. In a statement, Friedman said that he was ""honored and humbled"" to be nominated as ambassador to Israel. He pledged to ""work tirelessly to strengthen the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel."" Friedman's nomination is likely to face scrutiny from the US Senate, which must confirm all presidential appointments. It is unclear whether he will be able to secure the necessary support from both Republicans and Democrats. If confirmed, Friedman would replace Dan Shapiro, who has served as US ambassador to Israel since 2011. Shapiro is a career diplomat who has been praised for his work in strengthening US-Israel relations. Friedman's nomination comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Israel. Trump has been critical of the Obama administration's handling of the Iran nuclear deal, and he has pledged to take a tougher stance on Iran. He has also said that he is willing to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move that would be seen as a major provocation by the Palestinians. Friedman's nomination is likely to further strain US-Israel relations. His views on settlements are at odds with the Obama administration's position, and his close ties to the Trump administration could make it difficult for him to maintain a neutral stance in peace negotiations. It is unclear how Friedman's nomination will affect the US-Israel relationship, but it is clear that it will be a challenge for him to win the support of both the US Senate and the Palestinian leadership.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
India election 2019: Bringing power to the people,"India Election 2019: Empowering the People India's 2019 general election marked a historic moment for the world's largest democracy. Over 900 million eligible voters exercised their constitutional right, reaffirming the power of the people in shaping the nation's future. The election witnessed record turnout, particularly among first-time voters, who enthusiastically embraced their civic duty. The participation of millions of young Indians, women, and marginalized communities demonstrated the growing political maturity and aspiration for change within Indian society. The electoral process was largely peaceful and orderly, with extensive security measures and technological advancements ensuring transparency and fairness. The use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) reduced the potential for fraud and increased voter confidence. The results revealed a clear mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which secured an unprecedented second term in office. The party's victory was attributed to its populist appeal, strong leadership, and promises of economic growth and national security. However, the election also highlighted the continuing challenges faced by Indian democracy. The rise of political polarization, the spread of misinformation, and the influence of money and power in politics remain concerns that require ongoing attention. Beyond the electoral outcome, the 2019 election has significant implications for India's future. The massive turnout and participation of underrepresented groups signal a growing demand for inclusive governance and a desire for progress across all segments of society. The BJP's second term presents both opportunities and challenges. The party will have to navigate a complex political landscape, address socioeconomic disparities, and ensure that the benefits of growth are shared equitably. At the same time, the resounding mandate provides the BJP with the authority to implement its agenda. The party has pledged to focus on poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and national security. It remains to be seen how these promises will be translated into concrete policies and tangible improvements for the Indian people.

"Manx Chronicles 'should be returned to the Isle of Man', says MLC","The Manx Chronicles, a collection of medieval manuscripts that have been held in England for centuries, should be returned to the Isle of Man, an Isle of Man politician has said. Laurence Skelly MLC, the Isle of Man's representative on the British-Irish Council, said the chronicles were ""of immense cultural and historical significance"" to the island and their rightful home was on Manx soil. The chronicles, which date back to the 13th century, contain a wealth of information about the island's history, laws, and culture. They were compiled by monks at the Abbey of Rushen and were used to record the island's laws and customs. In the 16th century, the chronicles were taken to England by the English government and have been held in various libraries there ever since. They are currently housed in the British Library in London. Skelly said the chronicles were ""part of the fabric of Manx identity"" and their return to the island would be a ""significant act of reconciliation"" between the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom. ""These chronicles belong to the people of the Isle of Man,"" he said. ""They are a vital part of our history and culture, and they should be returned to their rightful home."" Skelly's call for the return of the chronicles has been supported by other Manx politicians and cultural figures. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the chronicles were ""an important part of our national heritage"" and the government would ""continue to explore all avenues"" to secure their return. Culture Vannin, the Isle of Man's national cultural organization, said the chronicles were ""a priceless treasure"" and their return to the island would be ""a major cultural event."" The British Library has said it is ""committed to preserving and making accessible the national collection for the benefit of all"" and that it would ""consider any request for the return of an item in its collection in accordance with its policies and procedures."" The chronicles are not the only Manx文物 that have been taken to England over the centuries. Other items include the Tynwald Cross, which is now housed in the British Museum, and the Laxey Wheel, which is now in the Science Museum in London. Skelly said the return of the chronicles would be a ""symbolic gesture"" that would help to heal the wounds of the past. ""The Isle of Man has a long and proud history,"" he said.

Manhole cover thieves 'may get death sentences' in China,"Manhole cover thieves in China could face the death penalty under new proposals to combat the rising problem of thefts. The move comes as authorities grapple with a surge in the number of manhole covers being stolen, posing a serious safety hazard to pedestrians and motorists. According to the Ministry of Public Security, over 50,000 manhole covers were reported stolen in China in 2022, a significant increase from previous years. The thefts have been particularly prevalent in rural areas, where manhole covers are often made of valuable metals such as iron and copper. The proposed death penalty for manhole cover thieves is part of a broader crackdown on metal theft in China. In recent years, the country has seen a dramatic increase in the theft of copper, aluminum, and other metals, which has led to losses of billions of yuan. The government has responded to the problem by increasing penalties for metal thieves and cracking down on the illegal sale of stolen metal. In 2021, the Ministry of Public Security launched a nationwide campaign to combat metal theft, which resulted in the arrest of over 100,000 suspects. The proposed death penalty for manhole cover thieves is likely to be controversial. Some human rights groups have expressed concern about the use of the death penalty for non-violent crimes. However, Chinese authorities argue that the harsh penalty is necessary to deter thefts and protect public safety. In addition to the proposed death penalty, the authorities are also considering a number of other measures to combat manhole cover thefts. These include: Increasing the use of GPS tracking devices to track manhole covers Installing surveillance cameras around manhole covers Increasing penalties for scrap metal dealers who purchase stolen manhole covers The government is also working with local communities to raise awareness of the problem of manhole cover thefts and to encourage people to report suspicious activity. The problem of manhole cover thefts is not unique to China. In many other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, manhole covers are often stolen for their scrap metal value. However, the proposed death penalty for manhole cover thieves in China is a sign of the government's determination to tackle the problem.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Justin Bieber apologises after cancelling rest of Purpose World Tour,"Pop superstar Justin Bieber has apologised to fans after abruptly cancelling the remaining dates of his Purpose World Tour. The singer, 23, announced the cancellation on Monday via Instagram, saying he needed to ""make myself a priority and focus on my well-being."" ""I have been looking forward to this tour my whole life, and I'm grateful for the experiences we've had while on the road,"" Bieber wrote. ""However, after careful consideration, I have decided to cancel the remaining dates of the Purpose World Tour."" Bieber has been open about his struggles with mental health in the past. In 2017, he cancelled the remainder of his ""Purpose"" tour due to ""unforeseen circumstances."" The singer's decision to cancel the remaining dates of his tour has been met with mixed reactions from fans. Some have expressed their understanding and support, while others have been disappointed and frustrated. ""I'm really disappointed that Justin Bieber cancelled his tour,"" one fan wrote on Twitter. ""I was so looking forward to seeing him live."" ""I understand that Justin Bieber needs to take care of his mental health,"" another fan tweeted. ""But I'm still sad that I won't get to see him perform."" Bieber's decision to cancel his tour comes at a time when mental health is becoming increasingly recognised as a serious issue. In recent years, a number of high-profile celebrities have spoken out about their own struggles with mental health, including Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato. Bieber's decision to cancel his tour is a reminder that mental health is just as important as physical health. It is important to seek help if you are struggling with your mental health, and to remember that you are not alone. If you are struggling with your mental health, there are a number of resources available to help you. You can talk to your doctor, a mental health professional, or a trusted friend or family member. You can also find support online through websites like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP).",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Leicester primary closes as only two teachers willing to return,"Leicester Primary Closes as Only Two Teachers Willing to Return A primary school in Leicester has been forced to close indefinitely after only two teachers expressed a willingness to return to work following the summer break. The decision was made after a risk assessment revealed that it would be impossible to maintain a safe environment for pupils with such a severe shortage of staff. The school, which has not been named, had already been operating with a reduced timetable due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the situation worsened over the summer holidays, with several teachers resigning or taking extended leave. The headteacher said that the school had explored every possible option to ensure it could reopen in September, but that it had been left with no choice but to close. ""This is a very difficult decision, but it is one that we have made in the best interests of our pupils,"" he said. ""We cannot compromise on their safety, and we simply do not have the staff to provide them with the quality of education that they deserve."" The closure will affect around 200 pupils, who will now need to find alternative schools. The local authority is working to provide support to affected families. The school's closure is the latest in a series of staffing issues that have hit schools across the country. In recent months, there have been reports of schools closing early due to a lack of teachers, and of headteachers struggling to recruit qualified staff. The government has said that it is committed to supporting schools and addressing the teacher shortage. However, it has also admitted that there is no quick fix to the problem. The closure of the Leicester primary school is a stark reminder of the challenges facing schools in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also a reminder of the importance of investing in education and ensuring that schools have the resources they need to provide a high-quality education for all pupils.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Campaign targets modern slavery in UK,"Modern slavery is a hidden crime that affects millions of people around the world, including in the UK. Victims are often forced to work in dangerous and exploitative conditions, for little or no pay. They may be trafficked into the country or forced into labour by threats of violence or other forms of coercion. A new campaign has been launched to raise awareness of modern slavery and encourage people to report suspected cases. The campaign, led by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), is targeting businesses, workers, and the public. The GLAA is a government agency that investigates and prosecutes cases of modern slavery and labour exploitation. The agency has seen a significant increase in reports of modern slavery in recent years, and believes that the problem is becoming more widespread. The campaign will use a variety of methods to reach its target audience, including: Posters and leaflets will be displayed in workplaces, schools, and other public places Social media campaigns will be used to raise awareness of the issue and encourage people to report suspicious activity The GLAA will work with businesses to help them identify and prevent modern slavery in their supply chains The campaign is part of a wider government effort to tackle modern slavery. The government has introduced a number of new laws and policies to combat the problem, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Modern Slavery Act is a landmark piece of legislation that has helped to raise awareness of modern slavery and made it easier for victims to get help. The Act requires businesses to report on the steps they are taking to prevent modern slavery in their supply chains, and it also creates a new offence of slavery and trafficking. The government is also working with other countries to tackle modern slavery. The UK is a member of the International Labour Organization's Global Business Network on Forced Labour, and it is also working with the European Union to develop a common approach to combating the problem. The campaign is a welcome step forward in the fight against modern slavery. By raising awareness of the issue and encouraging people to report suspicious activity, the campaign will help to make the UK a hostile environment for modern slavery. If you suspect that someone is being exploited or forced to work against their will, please report it to the GLAA on 0800 432 0804 or via the GLAA website.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Australia jet and navy data stolen in 'extensive' hack,"Australia jet and navy data stolen in 'extensive' hack Sensitive data from the Australian Defence Force (ADF), including information on fighter jets and navy ships, has been stolen in a major cyber attack, the government has confirmed. The hack, which was discovered in June, is believed to have been carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"", according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The stolen data includes information on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the ADF's most advanced fighter jet, as well as details of navy ships and submarines. The government has not released any information about who is responsible for the hack, but it is understood that the investigation is focused on China. The hack is a major embarrassment for the Australian government, which has been investing heavily in its cyber security capabilities in recent years. It is also a reminder of the growing threat of cyber attacks from state-sponsored actors. In a statement, the government said that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the hack and that it was taking ""all necessary steps"" to protect its systems and data. The government also said that it was working with its international partners to investigate the hack and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The hack is the latest in a series of cyber attacks against Australian targets in recent years. In 2019, the Australian Parliament was hacked, and in 2021, the Australian National University was also targeted. The government has said that it is committed to protecting its systems and data from cyber attacks, but it is clear that the threat is growing. The hack is a reminder that all organisations, both public and private, need to be vigilant against the threat of cyber attacks. They need to have strong cyber security measures in place and they need to be constantly monitoring their systems for any signs of suspicious activity. The government is also urging all Australians to be aware of the threat of cyber attacks and to take steps to protect themselves online. They can do this by using strong passwords, being careful about what they click on, and keeping their software up to date.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid in Scotland: 'Last stop' on A9 closes amid travel restrictions,"Amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of travel restrictions, the iconic ""Last Stop"" cafe on the A9 in Scotland has temporarily closed its doors. The establishment, a popular destination for weary travelers and long-distance drivers, has become the latest victim of the pandemic's impact on the hospitality industry. The cafe's closure is a reflection of the broader challenges facing Scotland's economy and the travel sector in particular. The Scottish government has imposed strict regulations on movement and gatherings in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, leading to a significant decline in tourism and travel. The ""Last Stop"" has been a mainstay on the A9 for over 50 years, serving as a welcome respite for those embarking on long journeys. Its closure marks a somber moment for the local community and the many regular customers who have come to rely on its warm hospitality and hearty food. The cafe's owners, the Fraser family, expressed their disappointment in a statement: ""It is with a heavy heart that we have decided to close the 'Last Stop' temporarily. The restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 have made it impossible for us to continue operating at a sustainable level."" They added: ""We understand that this will be upsetting news for our loyal customers, but we want to assure them that we will reopen as soon as the situation permits. We hope to see you all again soon."" The closure of the ""Last Stop"" is a symbol of the devastating impact that the pandemic has had on businesses across the UK. The hospitality industry has been particularly hard hit, with many restaurants, pubs, and hotels struggling to survive amidst the ongoing restrictions. The Scottish government has recognized the plight of businesses and has implemented a range of support measures, including grants and loans. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic remains uncertain, and it is unclear when the hospitality industry will fully recover. In the meantime, the closure of the ""Last Stop"" serves as a reminder of the resilience and adaptability of businesses and communities in the face of adversity. The cafe's owners have vowed to reopen when circumstances allow, and their loyal customers eagerly await the day when they can once again enjoy the warm hospitality and comforting food that has made it a legend on the A9.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Mental health in Norfolk and Suffolk '£30m underfunded',"Mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk underfunded by £30 million Mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk are underfunded by £30 million, according to a new report. The report, by the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, found that the trust is facing a funding gap of £30 million in the next financial year. This is despite the fact that the demand for mental health services is increasing. The report warns that the underfunding could lead to a reduction in services and longer waiting times for patients. It also says that the trust is at risk of not being able to meet its statutory obligations to provide mental health services. Dr. Mark Davies, the trust's chief executive, said that the underfunding is a ""serious threat"" to mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk. ""We are already seeing the impact of the underfunding, with longer waiting times for patients and a reduction in the number of services that we can offer,"" he said. ""If we do not address this funding gap, we will not be able to provide the high-quality mental health services that our patients need and deserve."" The report has been welcomed by mental health charities, who have called on the government to provide more funding for mental health services. ""This report is a wake-up call for the government,"" said Sue Baker, the chief executive of Mind. ""Mental health services are already overstretched and underfunded, and this report shows that the situation is only getting worse. The government must act now to provide more funding for mental health services, or else more people will suffer."" The government has said that it is committed to providing high-quality mental health services, and that it is working to reduce waiting times. However, the government has not yet announced any plans to increase funding for mental health services. The report's findings are likely to put pressure on the government to provide more funding for mental health services. If the government does not act, it is likely that mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk will continue to decline. What can you do to help? If you are concerned about the funding gap for mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk, you can contact your local MP or the Department of Health and Social Care. You can also donate to mental health charities, or volunteer your time to help people with mental health problems.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
China veterans urge sacking of politician Zhou Yongkang,"China veterans urge sacking of politician Zhou Yongkang Former military officers have accused a senior Chinese politician of corruption and called for his removal from office. In an open letter, 17 veteran generals and admirals urged President Xi Jinping to dismiss Zhou Yongkang, the former head of China's internal security apparatus. The letter, published on the website of the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, alleges that Zhou is guilty of ""serious dereliction of duty"" and ""abuse of power"". The allegations against Zhou come at a time when Xi Jinping is cracking down on corruption within the ruling Communist Party. Xi has warned that corruption is a ""cancer"" that could destroy the party and has vowed to root it out. The open letter from the veterans is a sign of growing frustration within the military over Zhou's continued presence in office. The veterans accuse Zhou of ""protecting criminals"" and ""interfering with the military's work"". They also allege that Zhou has ""damaged the reputation of the party and the country"". Zhou, 72, is a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party's top decision-making body. He was head of the Ministry of Public Security from 2007 to 2012 and was also responsible for overseeing China's domestic security apparatus. Zhou has not been charged with any crime, but he has been under investigation by the party's anti-corruption watchdog since last year. The open letter from the veterans is likely to increase pressure on Xi Jinping to take action against Zhou. Xi has previously said that he is ""determined to fight corruption, no matter who is involved"". The allegations against Zhou are serious and, if proven, could lead to his removal from office and even imprisonment. The open letter from the veterans is a sign that Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign is gaining momentum. It is also a sign that the military is becoming increasingly frustrated with Zhou Yongkang's continued presence in office.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Concern over 'remote supervision' of offenders by phone,"Concern over 'Remote Supervision' of Offenders by Phone The use of phone-based ""remote supervision"" to monitor offenders is raising concerns among experts and campaigners about the potential for reduced accountability and increased recidivism. This approach involves using technology to track offenders' movements, monitor their communications, and deliver support services remotely. While proponents argue that remote supervision can improve efficiency and reduce incarceration rates, critics warn that it could weaken the oversight and rehabilitative support provided in traditional in-person supervision. They argue that phone-based monitoring may not detect all violations, leading to offenders slipping through the cracks and potentially endangering the public. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the privacy implications of remote supervision, as offenders' movements and communications are constantly tracked. Critics argue that this could create a ""digital panopticon"" that erodes personal freedoms and undermines trust between offenders and supervision authorities. Campaigners also express concerns that remote supervision could exacerbate existing inequalities, as offenders from marginalized communities or with limited access to technology may face additional barriers to successful reintegration. They argue that in-person supervision provides a more tailored and supportive approach that can address the underlying factors contributing to offending behavior. Despite these concerns, the use of remote supervision continues to expand in many jurisdictions. Governments cite the potential cost savings and the ability to monitor a larger number of offenders than with traditional in-person supervision. However, experts emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation and oversight to ensure that remote supervision is implemented effectively and does not undermine public safety or the rehabilitation of offenders. Alternative Approaches In light of the concerns surrounding remote supervision, some experts propose alternative approaches to monitoring and supporting offenders. These include: Hybrid models: Combining in-person supervision with technology-assisted monitoring to provide a more tailored and effective approach. Community-based programs: Engaging local organizations and volunteers to provide support, mentoring, and job training opportunities for offenders. Peer support programs: Connecting offenders with individuals who have successfully reintegrated into society to provide guidance and encouragement. By exploring these alternative approaches, policymakers and criminal justice professionals can strive to find a balance between accountability and rehabilitation, ensuring that offenders receive the support they need to successfully reintegrate into society while maintaining public safety.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

""We believe this invasion will come from the north, east and south."" Zelensky did not provide any evidence to support his claim, but he said that Ukraine was preparing for a possible invasion and had already put its armed forces on high alert. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed Zelensky's claims as ""baseless scaremongering."" ""We have repeatedly stated that Russia has no intention of invading Ukraine,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. ""These allegations are nothing more than an attempt by the Ukrainian government to justify its own aggressive actions against the Russian-speaking population of eastern Ukraine.""

India tiger cubs 'may become man-eaters',"India: Tiger Cubs 'May Become Man-Eaters' Tiger cubs in India are facing a grave threat, with experts warning that they could become man-eaters due to a shortage of prey. The tiger population in India has been declining steadily in recent years, largely due to habitat loss and poaching. This has led to a shortage of prey animals for tigers, which are now forced to venture into human settlements in search of food. In the past few months, there have been several reports of tiger cubs attacking humans in India. In one incident, a tiger cub killed a six-year-old girl in the state of Maharashtra. In another incident, a tiger cub attacked a group of villagers in the state of Madhya Pradesh, injuring three people. The attacks have raised concerns that tiger cubs are becoming man-eaters. If the trend continues, it could pose a serious threat to human safety. ""Tiger cubs are highly vulnerable to starvation if they cannot find enough prey,"" said Dr. Hemendra Singh, a tiger expert. ""In such situations, they may become desperate and attack humans."" The problem is compounded by the fact that tiger cubs are often abandoned by their mothers. This can happen if the mother is killed by poachers or if she is unable to find enough food to sustain herself and her cubs. ""Abandoned tiger cubs have a very low chance of survival,"" said Singh. ""They often die of starvation or disease, or they are killed by other tigers."" The government of India is taking steps to address the shortage of prey for tigers. This includes initiatives to increase the population of wild prey animals and to reduce poaching. However, it will take time for these measures to have an impact. In the meantime, tiger cubs are at risk of becoming man-eaters. This is a serious threat that could have dire consequences for both tigers and humans.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Post-primary transfer included in NI education review,"Post-primary transfer included in NI education review A review of education in Northern Ireland will examine the post-primary transfer process, which has been criticized for causing stress and anxiety for pupils and their families. The independent review, announced by Education Minister Peter Weir, will also look at other aspects of the education system, including early years provision, special educational needs, and teacher training. The post-primary transfer process in Northern Ireland is currently based on academic selection, with pupils taking a standardized test at the age of 11 to determine which type of secondary school they will attend. There are two main types of secondary schools in Northern Ireland: grammar schools, which are selective, and non-selective schools, which admit pupils based on their proximity to the school. The process of academic selection has been criticized by some for being too stressful for pupils and for creating a two-tier education system. The review will consider a range of options for reforming the post-primary transfer process, including the possibility of moving to a non-selective system. The review will also look at other aspects of the education system, including: Early years provision: The review will consider how to improve early years provision in Northern Ireland, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Special educational needs: The review will consider how to improve support for pupils with special educational needs. Teacher training: The review will consider how to improve teacher training in Northern Ireland, including the possibility of introducing a new teacher training model. The review will be led by Tomorrows Schools, an independent education think tank. The review is expected to take around 18 months to complete. Welcoming the announcement of the review, Education Minister Peter Weir said: ""The education system in Northern Ireland is facing a number of challenges, including demographic change, the need to improve educational outcomes for all pupils, and the need to ensure that our education system is fit for the 21st century.

Nil-by-mouth case family in Salford hospital legal action,"Families of children who are being cared for by Salford Royal Hospital after being admitted to A&E with serious injuries have launched legal action against the hospital trust after it was revealed that they were denied food and water. The children were all admitted to the hospital's A&E department in the last year, suffering from a range of injuries including broken bones, head injuries, and burns. In each case, the children were not given any food or water for several hours, despite the fact that they were all in pain and distress. The families of the children have now instructed lawyers to take legal action against the hospital trust, arguing that the children's human rights were breached. They say that the children were denied their right to food and water, and that the hospital trust failed to take reasonable steps to protect their health and well-being. Salford Royal Hospital has admitted that the children were not given food or water for several hours, but said that this was due to a ""misunderstanding."" The hospital said that it has now changed its policy and that all children admitted to A&E will be given food and water as soon as possible. The families of the children are not satisfied with the hospital's explanation, and they say that they will continue to pursue legal action. They say that they want to ensure that other children do not suffer the same ordeal as their own children. The case has raised concerns about the treatment of children in A&E departments in the UK. A recent study by the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health found that one in five children admitted to A&E are not given food or water for several hours. The study also found that children who are not given food or water are more likely to experience pain, distress, and dehydration.

The delegation will include business leaders from a range of sectors, including finance, energy, and infrastructure. Cameron's visit to China comes at a time when the UK is seeking to develop closer economic ties with the world's second-largest economy. China is already the UK's sixth-largest trading partner, and the two countries have a combined trade worth £80 billion per year. However, there is still potential for further growth in trade between the two countries. The UK government estimates that the value of UK-China trade could reach £100 billion per year by 2025. Cameron's delegation will meet with Chinese government officials and business leaders to discuss ways to increase trade and investment between the two countries. The delegation will also visit a number of Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The visit is part of a wider effort by the UK government to boost trade with China. In 2015, the UK government launched a new trade and investment strategy for China, which set out a number of goals for increasing trade between the two countries. The strategy includes plans to increase the number of UK businesses exporting to China, to encourage Chinese investment in the UK, and to promote cooperation between UK and Chinese businesses in areas such as research and development.

London 2012: IOC's Oswald urges Olympic ticket 'fraud' bans,"London 2012: IOC's Oswald urges Olympic ticket 'fraud' bans London 2012 chief Denis Oswald says the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will ""push very hard"" for laws against Olympic ticket fraud. Organisers are concerned about touts and unofficial agencies cashing in on the Games. Oswald, chair of the IOC's co-ordination commission for London 2012, said such practices would be ""very unfair"" to people who had been unsuccessful in the official ballot. He said he hoped host cities would take action against fraudulent ticket sales. Oswald told BBC Sport: ""We will push very hard to get laws and regulations in place to avoid them cheating the system. ""There will be a platform created where you can only resell tickets at face value and not with big profits."" The London 2012 organising committee (LOCOG) is encouraging fans who have bought tickets in the official ballot to use the official ticket exchange to sell them on. The exchange was set up following complaints about touts reselling tickets at inflated prices for the Beijing Games in 2008. Fans who bought tickets for the Beijing Olympics often found them resold online for far more than face value. Oswald said the IOC and host cities had the responsibility to stamp out ticket fraud. ""It's a matter of protecting the Olympic Games and protecting the people who come to the Olympic Games,"" he said. ""If somebody works hard, saves money and wants to come, the best thing to do is to make sure they get it at face value and not getting cheated by some agent or dealer."" LOCOG insists that ticket fraud will not be tolerated and that offenders who are caught selling tickets illegally will face prosecution. It is working closely with the UK government and Trading Standards to enforce regulations against ticket touting. Anyone caught offering tickets for sale above face value will be prosecuted under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. They could face a fine of up to £5,000. LOCOG has also warned fans to be wary of buying tickets from unofficial sources. It says that tickets purchased from unauthorised sellers may be counterfeit or invalid.

Taylor Swift's new album Reputation isn't available to stream,"Taylor Swift's New Album Reputation Isn't Available to Stream Taylor Swift's highly anticipated sixth studio album, Reputation, is now available, but unlike her previous albums, it's not available on streaming services. Swift's decision to withhold the album from streaming platforms has sparked a debate about the future of music distribution and the artist's relationship with fans. For years, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have been the dominant way for people to consume music. They offer a convenient and affordable way to listen to a vast catalog of songs on demand. However, artists have expressed concerns about the low royalties they receive from streaming, which has led some to pull their music from these platforms. Swift is one of the most popular and influential artists in the world, and her decision to withhold Reputation from streaming is a significant blow to the music industry. It sends a message that artists are not willing to accept the low pay rates offered by streaming services. Some fans have expressed disappointment with Swift's decision, arguing that it makes it more difficult to listen to her music. Others have supported her move, saying that she is standing up for the rights of artists. Swift's decision is a reminder that the music industry is in a state of flux. Streaming services are now the primary way that people listen to music, but artists are still struggling to find a way to make a living from them. The debate over streaming is likely to continue for some time. In the meantime, fans can still purchase Reputation on physical formats like CD and vinyl. Swift's Relationship with Streaming Services Swift has had a complicated relationship with streaming services. In 2014, she pulled her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the service was not paying artists fairly. She later returned to Spotify in 2017, but only after the company agreed to increase its royalty rates. With Reputation, Swift has again decided to withhold her music from streaming services. This time, she has not publicly stated her reasons for doing so. However, it is possible that she is still unhappy with the way that streaming services compensate artists. It is also possible that Swift is using Reputation to promote her upcoming tour. The album is only available for purchase through her website and at Target stores. By making it exclusive to these outlets, Swift may be encouraging fans to buy tickets to her concerts.

Cwm Taf maternity: Review of midwife report handling,"Cwm Taf Maternity: Review of Midwife Report Handling An independent review has found that some midwife reports at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board were not handled appropriately. The review, led by Professor Cathy Warwick, was commissioned by the health board following concerns raised about the way some reports were handled. The review team looked at a sample of 400 midwife reports from 2014 to 2019. They found that: In 10% of cases, the midwife report was not completed within 24 hours of the birth. In 5% of cases, the midwife report contained inaccurate or incomplete information. In 2% of cases, the midwife report was not sent to the correct recipient. The review team also found that there was a lack of consistency in the way that midwife reports were handled. Some reports were filed away in a central location, while others were kept in the midwife's personal files. The review team has made a number of recommendations to improve the way that midwife reports are handled. These recommendations include: Ensuring that all midwife reports are completed within 24 hours of the birth. Ensuring that all midwife reports contain accurate and complete information. Ensuring that all midwife reports are sent to the correct recipient. Establishing a central location for the storage of all midwife reports. The health board has accepted the review team's recommendations and is working to implement them. The review team's findings are concerning and highlight the need for improvements in the way that midwife reports are handled. The health board must act quickly to implement the review team's recommendations in order to ensure that all women receive the high-quality care that they deserve. Response from Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board A spokesperson for Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said: ""We welcome the findings of the independent review and are committed to implementing the recommendations in full. We have already taken steps to improve the way that midwife reports are handled, including: Ensuring that all midwife reports are completed within 24 hours of the birth. Establishing a central location for the storage of all midwife reports. Providing additional training for midwives on the importance of completing accurate and complete reports. We are confident that these measures will help to improve the quality of care that we provide to women and their families.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
UK trade deficit biggest since 2008 in first quarter,"The UK's trade deficit surged to £27.1bn in the first quarter of 2023, the largest quarterly deficit since 2008, official figures show. The gap between the value of goods and services the UK exported and imported widened by £10.3bn compared with the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Exports in the first three months of the year fell by 1%, while imports rose by 3.1%. The increase in imports was driven by soaring energy prices, which added £6.7bn to the trade deficit. The ONS said the latest figures meant the UK's trade deficit in the year to the end of March was £108.6bn. This was £43.3bn more than in the previous 12 months. The widening trade deficit is a blow to the UK economy, as it means more money is being spent on imports than is being earned from exports. This can put downward pressure on the value of the pound and make it harder for UK businesses to compete with overseas rivals. The government has said it wants to reduce the UK's trade deficit by boosting exports, but economists say this will be a challenge in the current economic climate. ""The UK's trade deficit is a long-standing problem that has been made worse by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. ""The government needs to take steps to boost exports and make the UK more competitive on the world stage. This will require investing in infrastructure, education and skills."" The figures come as the UK economy is facing a number of challenges, including rising inflation and falling consumer confidence. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates again next week in an attempt to curb inflation. ""The widening trade deficit is another headwind for the UK economy,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""The government needs to focus on boosting exports and reducing imports, but this will be difficult to achieve in the current economic climate.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Poppers manufacturer 'will fight' legal high ban,"The manufacturer of poppers has said it will fight plans to ban the sale and possession of the substance. Rush Chem UK, which makes Rush Ultra Poppers, said the move was ""disproportionate"" and would ""criminalise"" responsible users. The government announced on Monday that it would ban the sale of so-called legal highs, including poppers, as part of a crackdown on drug abuse. Poppers, which are inhaled, are commonly used as a recreational drug, but they can also have medical uses, such as treating chest pain and erectile dysfunction. Rush Chem UK said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the government's plans and that it believed the ban was ""not based on sound scientific evidence"". ""Poppers have been used safely for decades by millions of people,"" the company said in a statement. ""We believe that the government's decision to ban them is disproportionate and will only serve to criminalise responsible users."" The company said it would be taking legal action to challenge the ban and that it was ""confident"" that it would be successful. The government said that the ban on poppers was necessary to protect public health. ""Poppers can be dangerous and have been linked to a number of deaths,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We are committed to taking action to reduce the harms caused by drug abuse."" The ban on poppers is expected to come into effect in the autumn. It will make it illegal to sell, possess or import the substance. Those who are caught breaking the ban could face up to seven years in prison. The government's decision to ban poppers has been welcomed by some, but it has also been criticised by others. The Public Health Minister, Steve Brine, said that the ban was ""the right thing to do"" and that it would ""protect people from harm"". However, the Liberal Democrats said that the ban was ""a waste of police time and resources"" and that it would ""do nothing to stop people using poppers"". The ban on poppers is the latest in a series of measures that the government has taken to crack down on drug abuse. In recent years, the government has banned a number of other so-called legal highs, including synthetic cannabis and mephedrone. The government has also increased the penalties for drug dealing and possession.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Russia's Putin calls Donald Trump 'a clever man' who will learn,"In a rare show of praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin has described his American counterpart, Donald Trump, as ""a clever man"" who will ""learn and adjust"" to the challenges of his office. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an international forum in St Petersburg, Putin said he believed Trump had the potential to be a good president, despite his lack of political experience. ""He's a very bright person, a talented person,"" Putin said. ""I think he will learn and adjust to the demands of his new job."" Putin's comments come at a time when relations between the United States and Russia are strained, over issues such as the ongoing war in Syria and Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election. However, Putin said he believed that Trump was capable of improving relations between the two countries. ""I think he's a pragmatist,"" Putin said. ""He's not a politician, he's a businessman. And I think he will approach his new job with the same pragmatism that he has applied to his business dealings."" Trump has previously praised Putin, calling him a ""strong leader"" and saying that he would be ""honored"" to meet him. However, Trump has also been critical of Russia, accusing it of aggression in Ukraine and cyber attacks against the United States. It is unclear how Trump will approach his relationship with Putin when he takes office on January 20. However, Putin's comments suggest that he believes Trump has the potential to be a good partner for Russia. Putin's praise for Trump is likely to be welcomed by Trump's supporters, who have long argued that he is a strong and decisive leader. However, it is also likely to be met with skepticism by Trump's critics, who believe that he is too inexperienced and impulsive to be president. Only time will tell whether Trump will be able to live up to Putin's expectations. However, Putin's comments suggest that he is willing to give Trump a chance.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
EU court orders Poland to halt court retirements law,"EU Court Orders Poland to Halt Court Retirements Law The European Court of Justice has ordered Poland to suspend a law that would have forced dozens of judges into early retirement. The court ruled that the law violated EU law by undermining the independence of the judiciary. The Polish government had argued that the law was necessary to reform the judiciary and remove communist-era judges from the bench. However, the EU court found that the law was not based on objective criteria and that it targeted judges who had been critical of the government. The ruling is a major blow to the Polish government, which has been accused of undermining the rule of law since coming to power in 2015. The government has already begun to implement the law, and it is unclear whether it will comply with the court's order. If Poland does not comply with the order, it could face financial penalties from the EU. The EU has already taken steps to suspend funding for Poland over its rule of law concerns. The ruling is also a victory for the Polish judges who have been fighting against the government's reforms. The judges have argued that the reforms are designed to silence dissent and to give the government control over the judiciary. The EU court's ruling is a reminder that the rule of law is a fundamental principle of the European Union. The EU is based on the idea that all citizens are equal before the law and that no one is above the law. The Polish government's actions have undermined the rule of law in Poland. The EU court's ruling is a step towards restoring the rule of law in Poland and protecting the independence of the judiciary. The ruling is also a warning to other governments that are considering taking similar actions. The EU will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the rule of law.

UKIP AM Michelle Brown faces committee over racial slur,"UKIP Assembly Member Michelle Brown is to face a special committee hearing over a racial slur she allegedly made. The hearing, which will take place on 23 March, will examine whether Brown breached the Assembly's code of conduct by calling a black outreach worker a ""monkey"" during a meeting in October 2021. Brown has denied the allegation, which was made by the outreach worker, Enny Nwala. The complaint was initially investigated by the Assembly's standards committee, which found that there was enough evidence to support the allegation. The committee decided to refer the matter to a special committee, which will have the power to recommend that Brown be suspended or expelled from the Assembly. Brown is the first UKIP member to face such a hearing. The hearing will be held in public and will be broadcast live on the Assembly's website. Brown, who has been a member of the Assembly since 2016, is a controversial figure. She has been accused of making a number of racist and Islamophobic comments in the past. In 2018, she was suspended from the Assembly for two weeks after she said that Muslims were ""a cancer"" on society. Brown's latest alleged offence has sparked outrage among anti-racism campaigners. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said that the allegation was ""deeply disturbing"". ""This is a reminder that racism is still a very real problem in our society,"" said the trust's director, Halima Begum. ""We hope that the Assembly will take swift and decisive action to hold Ms Brown to account for her alleged behaviour."" The Assembly's code of conduct states that members must ""treat others with respect and dignity"" and ""not discriminate against others on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability"". If Brown is found to have breached the code of conduct, she could face a range of penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the Assembly. The special committee hearing will be chaired by Labour AM John Biggs. Biggs said that the committee would ""consider all the evidence carefully and fairly"". ""We will then make our recommendations to the Assembly,"" he said. ""The Assembly will then decide what action to take.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"'Bed poverty' impacts thousands, says charity Buttle UK","'Bed poverty' impacts thousands, says charity Buttle UK Thousands of people in the UK are living in ""bed poverty,"" with many sleeping on the floor or in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, a new report has found. The report, by the charity Buttle UK, found that an estimated 2.5 million people in the UK do not have access to a decent bed. This includes people who are homeless, living in temporary accommodation, or struggling to afford a new bed. The report found that bed poverty has a devastating impact on people's health and well-being. People who sleep on the floor or in unsafe conditions are more likely to experience back pain, neck pain, and other health problems. They are also more likely to feel stressed, anxious, and depressed. Children who sleep in bed poverty are particularly vulnerable. They are more likely to miss school, fall behind in their studies, and develop behavioral problems. The report also found that bed poverty is often hidden. Many people who are living in bed poverty are ashamed of their situation and try to hide it from others. This can make it difficult for them to access help and support. Buttle UK is calling on the government to take action to address bed poverty. The charity is urging the government to provide more funding for homelessness services and temporary accommodation. It is also calling for the government to introduce a new benefit to help people on low incomes afford a new bed. “Bed poverty is a serious problem that is affecting millions of people in the UK,” said Peter Buttle, CEO of Buttle UK. “It is a hidden problem that is often overlooked, but it has a devastating impact on people's health and well-being.” “We are calling on the government to take action to address bed poverty. We need more funding for homelessness services and temporary accommodation. We also need a new benefit to help people on low incomes afford a new bed.” The report's findings are based on a survey of over 2,000 people in the UK.

Motorcyclists targeted in road safety drive,"Motorcyclists Targeted in Road Safety Drive As part of a concerted effort to improve road safety, authorities have launched a targeted campaign aimed at reducing the number of motorcycle-related accidents. The initiative, which will see an increased police presence on roads, is in response to statistics indicating a disproportionately high number of motorcycle fatalities and serious injuries. According to official figures, motorcyclists accounted for 20% of all road deaths in the past year, despite making up only 2% of vehicles on the road. This alarming trend has prompted concerns about the safety of motorcyclists, who are often more vulnerable to accidents due to their exposed position. The road safety drive will focus on several key areas, including: Increased police patrols: Police officers will be deployed to roads frequented by motorcyclists, with a particular emphasis on areas known for speeding and dangerous driving. Speed enforcement: Speeding is a major contributing factor to motorcycle accidents, and police will be using speed cameras and other measures to crack down on drivers who exceed the limits. Motorcycle training: Authorities will be offering free or subsidized motorcycle training courses to improve riders' skills and awareness. Public awareness campaigns: The campaign will include public service announcements, social media outreach, and educational materials to raise awareness of the dangers faced by motorcyclists and promote safe riding practices. In addition to these measures, authorities are also working with motorcycle organizations and advocacy groups to develop and implement safety initiatives. These partnerships aim to foster a shared responsibility for improving road safety and ensuring that motorcyclists can ride with confidence. Experts in road safety have welcomed the targeted approach of the campaign. ""Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable on the road, and it's essential that we do everything we can to protect them,"" said Dr. Emily Carter, a leading road safety researcher. ""This campaign is a positive step towards reducing the number of accidents and saving lives."" However, some motorcycle riders have expressed concerns that increased police enforcement could lead to unfair targeting or harassment. Authorities have emphasized that the campaign is not intended to punish responsible riders but to improve safety for all road users. The road safety drive is part of a broader effort to reduce the number of road fatalities and serious injuries. By focusing on motorcycle safety, authorities hope to make a significant impact on the statistics and create a more secure environment for everyone who shares the road.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Restaurant insolvencies jump as diners stay at home,"Restaurant Insolvencies Jump as Diners Stay at Home The hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic, with restaurant insolvencies surging as diners opt to stay home. Data from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) shows that 88 restaurant chains, including Carluccio's, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and Giraffe, have entered insolvency or administration since the start of the pandemic. This represents a 56% increase compared to the same period last year. The CRR attributes the surge in insolvencies to a combination of factors, including the government-imposed lockdowns, social distancing measures, and consumer reluctance to dine out. ""The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the restaurant sector,"" said Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR. ""With people unable to go out and eat, restaurants have been forced to close or operate at reduced capacity, leading to huge losses."" The government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which subsidized dining out in August and September, provided some relief for the industry. However, with the scheme now ended and cases of COVID-19 rising again, restaurants are facing an uncertain future. ""The outlook for the restaurant sector remains bleak,"" said Bamfield. ""Unless there is a significant improvement in consumer confidence and a lifting of restrictions, we expect to see further insolvencies in the coming months."" The surge in restaurant insolvencies is having a knock-on effect on the wider economy. The hospitality sector is one of the largest employers in the UK, accounting for over 3 million jobs. Restaurant closures are therefore likely to lead to job losses and reduced consumer spending. ""The government needs to take urgent action to support the hospitality industry,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality. ""This includes extending the furlough scheme, providing financial assistance to struggling businesses, and reducing business rates."" The government has announced a £1.5 billion support package for the hospitality sector, which includes grants for businesses that have been forced to close and a reduction in business rates. However, industry leaders say that more support is needed. ""The government's support package is a welcome start, but it is not enough,"" said Nicholls. ""We need to see more long-term measures to ensure that the hospitality industry can survive this crisis and emerge stronger on the other side.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Public sector hourly pay outstrips private sector pay,"Public Sector Hourly Pay Outstrips Private Sector Pay New figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have revealed that average hourly pay in the public sector has overtaken that in the private sector for the first time since records began in 2008. The ONS data shows that public sector employees earned an average of £26.58 per hour in August 2023, compared to £26.45 per hour in the private sector. This marks a significant change from the previous decade, when private sector pay consistently outpaced public sector pay. Several factors have contributed to this shift. Firstly, the government has implemented a series of pay rises for public sector workers in recent years, including teachers, nurses, and firefighters. This has helped to narrow the pay gap between the public and private sectors. Secondly, the cost of living crisis has disproportionately affected low-paid workers in the private sector, such as those in retail and hospitality. As a result, many private sector employers have struggled to recruit and retain staff, leading to upward pressure on wages. Thirdly, the public sector has been seen as a more secure and stable place to work during the current economic uncertainty. This has attracted workers from the private sector, further driving up public sector pay. The ONS data also shows that the pay gap between the public and private sectors is particularly pronounced in London and the South East of England. In these regions, public sector employees earn an average of £30.89 per hour, compared to £28.51 per hour in the private sector. The widening pay gap between the public and private sectors has raised concerns that it could lead to a brain drain from the public sector. However, the government has insisted that it is committed to paying public sector workers fairly. The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, said: ""These figures show that we are delivering on our promise to pay public sector workers fairly. Their hard work and dedication deserve to be rewarded."" The trade union Unison welcomed the news, but said that there was still more to be done. ""This is a step in the right direction, but we need to see further pay rises for public sector workers to ensure that they are not left behind,"" said general secretary Christina McAnea. The widening pay gap between the public and private sectors is a significant development. It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue in the long term, but it is clear that the government's pay policy and the cost of living crisis have had a major impact on the relative pay of public and private sector workers.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Norilsk Nickel: Mining firm pays record $2bn fine over Arctic oil spill,"Norilsk Nickel: Mining firm pays record $2bn fine over Arctic oil spill Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel has been ordered to pay a record 146.2 billion roubles ($2bn; £1.5bn) in compensation for an Arctic oil spill last year. The world's largest nickel and palladium producer was found responsible for the leak of 21,000 tonnes of diesel fuel at its power plant in Norilsk, Siberia, in May 2020. The spill, one of the worst in Russian history, polluted rivers and lakes and killed thousands of fish. Norilsk Nickel initially tried to downplay the extent of the damage, but later admitted it had underestimated the scale of the spill. The company has now agreed to pay the compensation to the Russian government, which will use the money to clean up the environment and support local communities affected by the spill. The fine is the largest ever imposed on a Russian company for environmental damage. 'Unprecedented environmental disaster' The spill occurred when a storage tank at the power plant collapsed, releasing a huge amount of diesel fuel into nearby rivers and lakes. The fuel spread over an area of more than 350 square kilometres (135 square miles), contaminating water supplies and killing thousands of fish. The spill also caused significant damage to the local ecosystem, as the fuel polluted soil and vegetation. The Russian government declared a state of emergency in the region and launched a major clean-up operation. Norilsk Nickel has been heavily criticised for its handling of the spill. The company initially tried to downplay the extent of the damage, and it took several days for it to inform the authorities about the full scale of the leak. The company has since apologised for its actions and has pledged to invest in environmental protection measures. Compensation and clean-up The $2bn fine will be used to fund the clean-up of the environment and to support local communities affected by the spill. The Russian government has said that the money will be used to restore damaged ecosystems, to provide compensation to fishermen and other businesses that have been affected by the spill, and to improve infrastructure in the region. Norilsk Nickel has also committed to investing in environmental protection measures at its operations. The company has said it will spend $1.5bn over the next five years on environmental projects, including the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities and the upgrade of existing infrastructure. The Arctic oil spill was a major environmental disaster, but it has also led to a renewed focus on environmental protection in Russia.

Business bank: Industry's views,"Business Bank: Industry's Views In the wake of the government's announcement of a new business bank, industry leaders have welcomed the move but also expressed concerns about its potential impact. The bank, which is set to receive £20 billion of government funding, is intended to provide loans to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) that are struggling to access finance from traditional lenders. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has praised the government's commitment to supporting SMEs, but has urged the bank to ensure that it is accessible to all businesses, including those with a poor credit history. ""SMEs are the backbone of the UK economy, and it is vital that they have access to the finance they need to grow and create jobs,"" said FSB chairman Mike Cherry. ""The government's new bank has the potential to make a real difference, but it is essential that it is accessible to all businesses, regardless of their size or credit history."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has also welcomed the new bank, but has expressed concerns about the potential for it to create an unlevel playing field between SMEs and larger businesses. ""We are concerned that the new bank could create a two-tier system, with SMEs being able to access cheaper finance than larger businesses,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. ""This could put larger businesses at a competitive disadvantage and stifle innovation."" The CBI, which represents large businesses, has also expressed concerns about the potential for the new bank to lead to a reduction in lending from traditional lenders. ""We urge the government to work with the banking sector to ensure that the new bank does not lead to a reduction in lending from traditional lenders,"" said CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. ""SMEs need access to a diverse range of funding options, and it is important that the new bank does not crowd out competition."" Despite these concerns, industry leaders generally agree that the new business bank is a positive step towards supporting SMEs. However, they believe that the government must carefully consider the potential impact on the wider banking sector and ensure that the bank is accessible to all businesses. In response to these concerns, the government has said that it is committed to ensuring that the new bank is accessible to all businesses and that it does not lead to a reduction in lending from traditional lenders. ""The new bank will be a valuable addition to the UK's financial landscape, and it will play a vital role in supporting SMEs to grow and create jobs,"" said Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond.

Ministers aim to 'rescue' Planning Bill by undoing changes,"Ministers are preparing to undo changes made to the Planning Bill in an attempt to salvage the legislation after it was heavily criticized. The bill, which aims to make it easier to build new homes in England, has been met with opposition from environmental groups, local authorities, and the public. Critics argue that the bill would weaken environmental protections, give developers too much power, and lead to the construction of poor-quality homes. In response to the criticism, the government has agreed to make a number of changes to the bill, including: Restoring the requirement for environmental assessments Giving local authorities more say over planning decisions Strengthening protections for green spaces The government hopes that these changes will address the concerns of critics and allow the bill to pass through Parliament. However, it is unclear whether these changes will be enough to satisfy opponents of the bill. The bill is due to be debated in the House of Commons on Monday, and it is likely to face a tough battle. Reaction from environmental groups has been mixed. Some groups, such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, have welcomed the changes, but others, such as Greenpeace, have said that they do not go far enough. Local authorities have also expressed concerns about the bill. The Local Government Association has said that the bill would give developers too much power and would undermine local democracy. The public has also been critical of the bill. A recent poll by YouGov found that 57% of people oppose the bill, while only 28% support it. The government is facing a difficult task in trying to salvage the Planning Bill. The bill is unpopular with environmental groups, local authorities, and the public. The government will need to make significant concessions if it wants to get the bill through Parliament. If the bill is passed, it will have a major impact on the planning system in England. The bill would make it easier to build new homes, but it would also weaken environmental protections and give developers more power. It is important to note that these changes would not apply to Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Rallies call for return of devolved assembly at Stormont,"Rallies call for return of devolved assembly at Stormont Thousands of people have taken part in rallies in Belfast and Londonderry, calling for the return of the devolved assembly at Stormont. The assembly has been suspended since January 2017 due to a dispute between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin over the Irish language and other issues. The rallies were organized by the ""Time to Talk"" campaign, which is supported by a number of political parties and civil society groups. Speaking at the rally in Belfast, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that the suspension of the assembly was ""a disgrace"" and that it was time for the parties to get back to work. ""We need to find a way to work together,"" he said. ""We need to find a way to compromise."" Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald also spoke at the rally, saying that the people of Northern Ireland had ""had enough"" of the political deadlock. ""We need to get back to Stormont and start working for the people,"" she said. The rallies come at a time when there is growing pressure on the DUP and Sinn Féin to reach an agreement. The British government has said that it is prepared to legislate to restore the assembly if the parties cannot reach an agreement by the end of the year. The Irish government has also said that it is prepared to take action if the parties cannot reach an agreement. The European Union has also expressed its concern about the ongoing political deadlock in Northern Ireland. In a statement, the EU Commission said that it was ""essential"" for the assembly to be restored as soon as possible. The rallies are a sign of the growing public frustration with the ongoing political deadlock. People are tired of the political games and they want to see the assembly restored so that it can start working for them again. It is now up to the DUP and Sinn Féin to show that they are listening to the people and that they are prepared to compromise. If they can do that, then there is hope that the assembly can be restored and that Northern Ireland can move forward.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Canada 'will not back down' over US metals tariffs,"Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has said her country ""will not back down"" in its dispute with the US over metals tariffs. Speaking at a news conference in Ottawa, Freeland said the tariffs were ""unfair and unacceptable"" and that Canada would ""defend its interests vigorously."" The US imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union in March, citing national security concerns. Canada has since retaliated with tariffs on $16.6 billion worth of US goods, including steel, aluminum and other products. Freeland said Canada was ""disappointed"" by the US decision to impose tariffs, but that it was ""not surprised."" ""We have been clear from the beginning that we believe these tariffs are unfair and unacceptable,"" she said. ""We will defend our interests vigorously."" Freeland said Canada was ""prepared to negotiate"" with the US to resolve the dispute, but that it would not do so under the threat of tariffs. ""We are not going to negotiate under duress,"" she said. ""We are not going to back down."" The US has said it is willing to negotiate with Canada, but that it will not remove the tariffs until Canada agrees to concessions on trade. The dispute between the two countries has raised concerns about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA is a trilateral trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico that has been in place since 1994. The US has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if it cannot be renegotiated to its satisfaction. Freeland said Canada was ""committed"" to NAFTA, but that it was ""also prepared"" to walk away if the US withdrew. ""We are not going to be bullied into a bad deal,"" she said. ""We are prepared to walk away if necessary."" The dispute between Canada and the US is the latest in a series of trade conflicts between the two countries. In recent months, the US has also imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and has threatened to impose tariffs on cars from the EU. The trade conflicts have raised concerns about the global economy and have led to fears of a trade war.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Avon and Somerset Police officer sacked after sexting on duty,"Avon and Somerset Police Officer Dismissed for Sexting on Duty An Avon and Somerset Police officer has been dismissed after engaging in inappropriate behavior while on duty. An investigation by the force's Professional Standards Department found that the officer had sent sexually explicit messages to a civilian on their personal mobile phone while on shift. The officer, who has not been named, admitted the allegations and was subsequently dismissed without notice at a disciplinary hearing held on Wednesday. Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Watson said: ""We expect the highest standards of behavior from all of our officers and staff. The public rightly expects us to uphold the law and protect them from harm, and we will not tolerate any behavior that falls short of these expectations."" ""This officer's behavior was a clear breach of our standards and has resulted in their dismissal. We will continue to take robust action against any officer or member of staff who engages in inappropriate or criminal behavior."" The investigation began after the force received a complaint from a member of the public who had witnessed the officer sending the messages. The officer had been with the force for several years and had a good record prior to this incident. However, the force said that the seriousness of the offense meant that they had no option but to dismiss the officer. The officer now faces a possible criminal prosecution as well as being placed on the College of Policing's Barred List, which prevents them from working in policing or any other role that requires vetting. The force said that the incident had been reported to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has the power to investigate complaints against the police. The IOPC has confirmed that it is assessing the available information to determine whether an independent investigation is required. The incident has raised concerns about the use of mobile phones by police officers while on duty. The force said that officers are allowed to use their personal phones for legitimate work purposes, but they must not be used for inappropriate or criminal behavior. The force has said that it will be reviewing its policies and procedures on the use of mobile phones to ensure that officers are clear about what is expected of them.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Spina bifida womb op baby back home in Essex,"A baby girl who underwent pioneering surgery in the womb for spina bifida is back home in Essex with her family. The delicate operation, which was carried out at 25 weeks of pregnancy, was the first of its kind at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London. Baby Willow's mother, Felicity, said she and her husband Chris were ""over the moon"" to have their little girl home. ""She's doing really well,"" she said. ""She's feeding well and she's just a happy little baby."" Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spinal cord doesn't close properly during pregnancy. This can cause a range of problems, including paralysis, incontinence and learning difficulties. Traditional treatment for spina bifida involves surgery after the baby is born. However, this can be risky and can lead to further complications. The new surgery, known as fetoscopic myelomeningocele repair, is carried out while the baby is still in the womb. This means that the risks of surgery are reduced and the baby has a better chance of a normal life. Willow's surgery was carried out by a team of specialist doctors and nurses led by Professor Paolo De Coppi. The operation took four hours and involved making a small incision in Felicity's womb. A tiny camera was then inserted into the womb and the team used a laser to close the opening in Willow's spinal cord. The surgery was a success and Willow was born two months later by Caesarean section. She spent the first few weeks of her life in hospital but is now back home with her family. ""We're just so grateful to the team at St George's for everything they've done,"" said Felicity. ""They've given Willow the best possible start in life."" Professor De Coppi said he was delighted with the outcome of the surgery. ""This is a major breakthrough in the treatment of spina bifida,"" he said. ""We're now able to offer families a new hope for their children."" The surgery is still in its early stages and it is not yet clear how effective it will be in the long term. However, the early results are promising and it is hoped that it will become the standard treatment for spina bifida in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Job loss claim over 'deeply flawed' exit plan,"Brexit: Job loss claim over 'deeply flawed' exit plan A leaked government document has revealed that the UK is set to lose up to 800,000 jobs in the wake of Brexit, a far higher figure than the government has previously admitted. The document, which was obtained by the BBC, also warns that the economy will be 2% smaller than it would have been if the UK had remained in the EU. The government has dismissed the claims in the document, saying that they are ""deeply flawed"" and that the UK will be better off outside the EU. However, the leak has raised fresh concerns about the economic impact of Brexit, which is already causing uncertainty and disruption for businesses. The leaked document is a report by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), which was commissioned by the Treasury. The report assesses the impact of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, in which the UK leaves the EU without a deal on future trading arrangements. The report finds that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a sharp fall in trade with the EU, which would in turn lead to job losses and a slowdown in economic growth. The report also warns that a no-deal Brexit would damage the UK's reputation as a reliable trading partner, which could make it harder for businesses to attract investment and grow. The government has dismissed the claims in the report, saying that they are ""deeply flawed"" and that the UK will be better off outside the EU. However, the leak has raised fresh concerns about the economic impact of Brexit, which is already causing uncertainty and disruption for businesses. The leaked document is the latest in a series of warnings about the economic impact of Brexit. In recent months, the Bank of England has warned that Brexit could lead to a recession, and the International Monetary Fund has said that the UK's economy will grow more slowly than the rest of the developed world in the coming years. The government has insisted that it is prepared for a no-deal Brexit, but businesses are increasingly concerned about the potential impact on their operations. A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found that two-thirds of businesses are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit. The leaked document is likely to add to the pressure on the government to reach a deal with the EU on future trading arrangements. However, it is unclear whether the EU is willing to make the concessions that the UK government is seeking. The UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. If a deal is not reached by then, the UK will leave without a deal, which could have a significant impact on the UK economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Youth unemployment doubled in East during Covid-19 pandemic,"Youth unemployment in the East of England more than doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new figures. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds claiming unemployment benefits in the region rose by 126% between March 2020 and March 2021, from 12,895 to 29,250. This is the highest increase in youth unemployment of any region in England, and is significantly higher than the national average of 83%. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that the East of England is now the region with the third highest rate of youth unemployment in England, after the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. The rise in youth unemployment is likely to have been caused by a number of factors, including the closure of businesses during lockdown, the reduction in job vacancies, and the increase in competition for jobs. Young people are often the first to be laid off during an economic downturn, as they are often employed in low-paid, insecure jobs. They are also more likely to be working in sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality, retail, and tourism. The rise in youth unemployment is a major concern, as it can have a significant impact on young people's long-term career prospects. Young people who are unemployed for a long period of time are more likely to be unemployed in the future, and they are also more likely to experience lower wages and job insecurity. The government has announced a number of measures to help young people into work, including the Kickstart scheme, which provides funding for employers to create new jobs for young people. However, it is unclear whether these measures will be enough to address the high levels of youth unemployment in the East of England. The ONS figures also show that the overall unemployment rate in the East of England has risen to 4.7%, up from 3.8% in March 2020. This is higher than the national average of 4.1%. The rise in unemployment is likely to have a significant impact on the local economy, as it will reduce consumer spending and investment. It is also likely to lead to an increase in poverty and inequality.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

John Lewis to pull 'Never knowingly undersold' pledge,"John Lewis to pull 'Never knowingly undersold' pledge Department store chain John Lewis is to scrap its long-standing ""Never knowingly undersold"" pledge, which has been a cornerstone of its marketing strategy for nearly a century. The retailer said the move was necessary to reflect the changing retail landscape, which has seen the rise of online shopping and increased competition from discounters. John Lewis said it would continue to offer competitive prices, but would no longer match the prices of other retailers on a like-for-like basis. The decision has been met with mixed reactions from customers. Some have expressed disappointment, saying that the pledge was one of the things that made John Lewis unique. Others have said that the move is understandable, given the challenges facing the retail sector. John Lewis first introduced its ""Never knowingly undersold"" pledge in 1925. The pledge was designed to reassure customers that they were getting the best possible price on their purchases. However, in recent years, John Lewis has come under increasing pressure from online retailers, which can often offer lower prices due to their lower overheads. The retailer has also faced competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which have gained market share by offering lower-priced products. John Lewis said that the decision to scrap its ""Never knowingly undersold"" pledge was not taken lightly. ""We know that our customers value our commitment to offering competitive prices,"" a spokesperson said. ""However, we believe that this change is necessary to ensure that we can continue to offer the high-quality products and services that our customers expect."" John Lewis said it would continue to offer a price match guarantee on certain products, but this would be on a case-by-case basis. The retailer also said that it would continue to invest in its online offering and its physical stores. ""We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience, both online and in-store,"" the spokesperson said. The decision by John Lewis to scrap its ""Never knowingly undersold"" pledge is a sign of the changing retail landscape. Consumers are increasingly shopping online and are more price-conscious than ever before. Retailers are having to adapt to these changes in order to survive.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Life Sciences Bridging Fund offers antibiotic 'lifeline',"Life Sciences Bridging Fund offers antibiotic 'lifeline' The government has announced a £100 million fund to support the development of new antibiotics to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The Life Sciences Bridging Fund will provide grants to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help them advance promising antibiotic candidates through clinical trials. AMR occurs when bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics used to treat them, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of serious illness and death. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified AMR as one of the most urgent global health threats, with drug-resistant infections estimated to cause 700,000 deaths each year. In the UK, AMR is responsible for an estimated 5,000 deaths each year and costs the NHS billions of pounds. The Life Sciences Bridging Fund is part of the government's AMR Action Plan, which was launched in 2019. The plan aims to tackle AMR through a range of initiatives, including investing in research and development, improving surveillance, and promoting responsible antibiotic use. The fund is expected to support up to 15 projects, each of which will receive up to £10 million. The projects will be selected through a competitive process and will be assessed on their scientific merit, potential impact on AMR, and the ability of the SME to bring the product to market. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern medicine, and it is vital that we take action now to develop new antibiotics. ""The Life Sciences Bridging Fund will provide a much-needed lifeline to small businesses developing promising antibiotic candidates, helping them to bring new treatments to market and save lives."" The fund will be managed by Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency. Innovate UK's chief executive officer, Ian Campbell, said: ""We are delighted to be working with the government to deliver this important fund. ""The Life Sciences Bridging Fund will provide a vital source of support to SMEs developing new antibiotics, helping them to overcome the challenges of clinical trials and bring their products to market. ""This investment will not only help to tackle the threat of AMR, but will also support the growth of the UK life sciences sector.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
East Kent X-ray need sees Faversham injuries unit close,"East Kent X-ray need sees Faversham injuries unit close An urgent need for X-ray facilities at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital has led to the temporary closure of the Faversham Minor Injuries Unit (MIU). East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust (EKH) took the difficult decision to close the MIU from October 31 to allow for the urgent installation of a new X-ray machine at the hospital in Canterbury. The trust said the closure was necessary to ensure the safety of patients and staff, as the existing X-ray machine at the Faversham MIU is no longer fit for purpose. ""We understand that this closure will be disappointing for the local community,"" said Chris Streather, EKH's director of operations. ""However, we want to assure the public that this is a temporary measure and that we are committed to reopening the MIU as soon as possible."" The trust said it is exploring all options to minimize disruption to patients, including providing transport to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital for those who need X-rays. Patients with minor injuries are being advised to attend the Margate MIU, the Sheerness MIU, or the urgent treatment centre (UTC) at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford. The trust said it is working closely with the South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) to ensure that patients are able to access the most appropriate care. ""We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,"" said Mr. Streather. ""We would like to thank the public for their understanding and cooperation during this time.""

Statute of limitations plan 'unhelpful'- Simon Coveney,"The Irish government's plan to introduce a 30-year statute of limitations for historical institutional abuse has been described as ""unhelpful"" by Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney. The proposed legislation would mean that victims of abuse in institutions run by the state, religious orders, or other organisations would have 30 years from the date of the abuse to take legal action. However, Coveney said that the plan would not help victims who were abused as children, as they would have already passed the 30-year time limit. ""I think it's unhelpful to suggest that we're going to have a statute of limitations that will apply to everybody,"" Coveney said. ""The reality is that for many people who were abused as children, the 30-year time limit will have already passed."" Coveney said that the government was still considering its options on how to deal with historical institutional abuse. ""We're not going to rush into anything,"" he said. ""We want to get this right. We want to make sure that we have a system that is fair to victims and that also protects the rights of the accused."" The government's plan has been criticized by victim support groups, who say that it will deny justice to many victims of abuse. ""This is a betrayal of victims,"" said Maeve Lewis, chair of the Survivors of Child Abuse group. ""The government is saying that it's not interested in helping people who were abused as children."" The Irish government has been under pressure to introduce a statute of limitations for historical institutional abuse for a number of years. In 2019, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called on the government to introduce a statute of limitations that would not apply to child abuse cases. The government has said that it is committed to addressing the issue of historical institutional abuse. However, it has not yet said when it will introduce legislation to do so.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Elections 2021: Millions voting in bumper set of polls,"Elections 2021: Millions Voting in Bumper Set of Polls Voters across the United Kingdom are heading to the polls today in a series of local and regional elections. Over 4,000 councillors will be elected in England, while voters in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland will choose their representatives in devolved parliaments and assemblies. The elections are seen as a crucial test for the governing Conservative Party, which has been in power for the past decade. The party faces challenges from the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, and a resurgent Scottish National Party. The results of the elections will have a significant impact on the political landscape of the UK. They will also provide an indication of public opinion ahead of the next general election, which is due to be held in 2024. Polling stations opened at 7am this morning and will remain open until 10pm. Voters are being urged to wear face coverings and maintain social distancing measures due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first results are expected to start coming in shortly after midnight, with the majority of results likely to be declared by Friday morning. Key Races England: The Conservatives are expected to face a strong challenge from Labour in major cities such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham. The Liberal Democrats are also hoping to make gains in areas where they have traditionally been strong, such as the South West and the East of England. Scotland: The Scottish National Party is seeking to win a majority in the Scottish Parliament, which would give it the mandate to hold a second referendum on independence. The Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats are all vying to form the main opposition party. Wales: Labour is the largest party in the Welsh Assembly, but the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, and the Liberal Democrats are all hoping to make gains. The election will also see the first-ever election for a Welsh Youth Parliament, which will give young people a voice in the Assembly. Northern Ireland: Sinn Féin is the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, but the Democratic Unionist Party, the Alliance Party, and the Ulster Unionist Party are all hoping to challenge their dominance. The election will also see the first-ever election for a Northern Ireland Youth Assembly. Voter Turnout Voter turnout in local and regional elections has traditionally been lower than in general elections. However, there are hopes that the high-profile nature of some of the races this year, particularly in Scotland, will encourage more people to vote. The Electoral Commission is urging voters to make sure they are registered to vote and to bring their polling cards with them when they go to vote. Results The first results are expected to start coming in shortly after midnight, with the majority of results likely to be declared by Friday morning.

Syria air strikes: For and against UK action,"Syria Air Strikes: Weighing the Arguments The UK government's decision to participate in air strikes against targets in Syria has ignited a heated debate, with proponents and opponents presenting compelling arguments. In Favor of UK Action: Humanitarian Intervention: Advocates argue that the air strikes are necessary to prevent further civilian casualties in Syria's ongoing civil war. The chemical weapons attack in Douma has been condemned as a war crime, and it is feared that the Assad regime could use such weapons again. International Responsibility: The UK has a moral obligation to protect civilians from mass atrocities, and air strikes can serve as a deterrent to further aggression. The use of chemical weapons violates international law and undermines the global order. Long-Term Stability: Proponents contend that air strikes can weaken the Assad regime and create space for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. By targeting military assets and infrastructure supporting the regime, the strikes can erode its power base. Against UK Action: Escalation of Conflict: Critics warn that air strikes could escalate the already fragile situation in Syria and lead to an unintended conflict with Russia, which supports the Assad regime. Limited Effectiveness: Sceptics argue that air strikes alone are unlikely to be sufficient to achieve their objectives. The Assad regime has shown resilience in the past and may adapt to the new attacks. Lack of Clear Strategy: Opponents criticize the UK government for failing to articulate a clear and coherent strategy for what it hopes to achieve with air strikes. They argue that without a broader diplomatic effort, the strikes may be counterproductive. Possible Civilian Casualties: Air strikes inevitably pose a risk of civilian casualties. Critics worry that the UK may inadvertently harm innocent lives while attempting to target the Assad regime. Conclusion: The decision of whether or not to participate in air strikes in Syria is complex. There are strong arguments to be made both for and against UK action. Ultimately, the government must weigh the potential benefits and risks carefully before making a decision. It is important to note that there is no consensus on the issue among experts or the public. The debate is likely to continue as the air strikes proceed and their consequences unfold.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The POA has welcomed the recruitment drive, but said that more needs to be done to address the long-term challenges facing the prison service. POA chairman Mark Lindsay said: ""This recruitment drive is a welcome step, but it is only a short-term fix. ""We need to see a long-term investment in the prison service, including more funding and more staff.

Amanda Knox: DNA evidence defended by Italian police,"Italian police have defended the use of DNA evidence in the case of Amanda Knox, the American student who was convicted of murdering her roommate in Italy in 2007. Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty of killing Meredith Kercher in the Italian town of Perugia. They were both sentenced to 26 years in prison, but Knox was acquitted on appeal in 2011 and Sollecito in 2015. However, the case remains open in Italy, and prosecutors have continued to investigate the possibility that Knox and Sollecito were involved in the murder. In 2019, police announced that they had found new DNA evidence linking Knox to the crime scene. The evidence is a small amount of DNA that was found on the clasp of Kercher's bra. Police say that the DNA matches Knox's DNA profile. Knox has denied any involvement in the murder, and her lawyers have argued that the DNA evidence is unreliable. In a statement, Italian police defended the use of the DNA evidence. They said that the evidence was ""consistent"" with the other evidence in the case, and that it ""supports the conclusion that Knox was present at the scene of the crime."" The police also said that they had conducted a thorough investigation and that they were confident in the reliability of the DNA evidence. The case of Amanda Knox has been closely followed around the world. It has raised questions about the reliability of DNA evidence and the fairness of the Italian justice system. The new DNA evidence is likely to reignite the debate over Knox's guilt or innocence. It is also likely to put further pressure on the Italian authorities to bring the case to a close. In a statement, Knox's lawyers said that they were ""disappointed"" by the police's decision to continue to pursue the case.

What Charles Manson and his followers did in California in 1969,"In the heart of California's sun-kissed summers of 1969, a sinister shadow emerged, casting a pall of darkness over the idyllic landscape. Charles Manson, a charismatic yet deeply disturbed cult leader, orchestrated a series of heinous crimes that sent shockwaves through the nation. Manson's followers, a ragtag group of mostly young and impressionable individuals, were lured into his twisted world of violence and mind control. They established a commune on the Spahn Ranch, a desolate property near Los Angeles, where Manson propagated his distorted beliefs and exerted absolute power over his adherents. On the fateful night of August 9, 1969, Manson directed four of his followers to the Cielo Drive residence of actress Sharon Tate. Armed with knives and guns, they brutally slaughtered Tate, who was eight months pregnant, along with four others present. The victims, including celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring and coffee heiress Abigail Folger, were stabbed and shot multiple times. The assailants scribbled ""PIG"" on the front door in Tate's blood. The following night, Manson's followers carried out another horrific attack, murdering Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home nearby. Again, the walls were adorned with chilling inscriptions, including ""DEATH TO PIGS."" Manson's motives remain shrouded in mystery. Some speculate that he sought revenge against the wealthy and famous, while others believe he was driven by a warped desire for chaos and notoriety. Regardless, the crimes he orchestrated left an indelible scar on society. The subsequent investigation unraveled a web of drug use, brainwashing, and violence that had characterized Manson's commune. The trial, which spanned nine months, gripped the nation and captivated the world's attention. Manson and several of his followers were convicted of multiple murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Manson murders continue to haunt the collective memory as a testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic facades. They serve as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked violence and the insidious power of cult indoctrination.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

'Stansted 15' protesters' counter-terrorism convictions appealed,"Stansted 15 Protesters Appeal Counter-Terrorism Convictions Fifteen protesters known as the ""Stansted 15"" are appealing their convictions for terrorism offenses related to a demonstration against the use of Stansted Airport for arms transportation. In March 2017, the group of British activists blocked access to the airport's runway in a protest against the alleged role it played in transporting weapons to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, countries accused of human rights abuses. Following a high-profile trial, twelve of the protesters were found guilty of conspiracy to cause public nuisance and sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to six months. Three others were convicted of inciting others to engage in public nuisance and received suspended sentences. The protesters' lawyers have now filed an appeal, arguing that the convictions should be overturned on several grounds, including that: The trial judge misdirected the jury on the definition of public nuisance. The prosecution failed to prove that the protesters' actions were intended to cause disruption. The sentences imposed were excessive and disproportionate. The protesters' supporters maintain that their actions were justified as a form of legitimate protest against the arms trade. They argue that the use of terrorism charges against them was a heavy-handed attempt to criminalize dissent. The appeal hearing is expected to take place later this year. If successful, it could overturn the protesters' convictions and raise questions about the use of counter-terrorism legislation against non-violent demonstrators. Meanwhile, the Stansted 15 remain vocal about their opposition to arms exports and their belief in the right to protest peacefully.

Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines president says he killed someone as teenager,"Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines President Says He Killed Someone as Teenager Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has admitted to killing someone when he was a teenager, in the latest controversial revelation from the outspoken leader. Speaking at a press conference, Duterte said he was 16 years old when he shot and killed a fellow student in a fight. He said the incident happened in his hometown of Davao City in the southern Philippines. ""I was 16 years old. I had a fight with a guy. I stabbed him. He died,"" Duterte said. ""That's it."" The president did not provide any further details about the incident, such as the name of the victim or the circumstances that led to the fight. Duterte's admission has sparked outrage from some quarters, with critics accusing him of glorifying violence and encouraging others to take the law into their own hands. However, Duterte's supporters have defended his comments, arguing that they simply reflect his tough-on-crime stance and his willingness to admit his own past mistakes. Duterte has previously made similar admissions about his past behavior. In 2016, he said he had personally killed three suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City. Those remarks led to accusations that he was a serial killer, but Duterte has denied these allegations, saying that he only killed in self-defense or in the line of duty. Duterte's latest admission comes at a time when he is facing increasing pressure over his human rights record. Thousands of people have been killed in his war on drugs, which critics say has been marked by extrajudicial killings and other abuses. Duterte has defended the campaign, saying it is necessary to rid the Philippines of the scourge of illegal drugs. However, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently investigating the killings, and Duterte has threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC if it prosecutes him. Despite the controversy surrounding him, Duterte remains popular among many Filipinos. They see him as a strong leader who is not afraid to take decisive action against crime and corruption.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Western Sahara welcomes Morocco's African Union membership,"Western Sahara, a disputed territory in North Africa, has welcomed Morocco's recent readmission to the African Union (AU). Morocco's return to the AU, after a 33-year absence, has been met with mixed reactions in the region. The Polisario Front, which seeks independence for Western Sahara, has condemned the move, calling it a violation of international law. However, many other countries in the region, including Algeria and Mauritania, have welcomed Morocco's return to the AU. Western Sahara has been a source of tension between Morocco and the Polisario Front since the former Spanish colony gained independence in 1975. Morocco claims the territory as its own, while the Polisario Front wants it to be an independent state. The AU has been trying to mediate a solution to the conflict for decades, but so far no agreement has been reached. Morocco's return to the AU could give the peace process a new impetus, but it is too early to say what impact it will have. Some analysts believe that Morocco's return to the AU could help to isolate the Polisario Front and put pressure on it to negotiate a settlement. Others argue that it could simply embolden Morocco and make it less likely to compromise. Only time will tell what the long-term impact of Morocco's return to the AU will be. However, it is clear that the move has opened a new chapter in the history of the Western Sahara conflict. In the meantime, Western Sahara remains a disputed territory, with no clear path to a resolution in sight. The people of Western Sahara continue to live in poverty and uncertainty, and the conflict has had a devastating impact on their lives. The AU has a responsibility to help resolve the conflict and bring peace to Western Sahara. Morocco's return to the AU could provide an opportunity to do so, but it is important to remember that there is still a long way to go.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Greening: UK will not accept migrant relocation quotas,"Greening: UK will not accept migrant relocation quotas Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said the UK will not accept quotas for the relocation of migrants within the EU. She said the government would consider voluntary arrangements but would not be ""subject to EU decisions"". Ms Rudd's comments come ahead of a meeting of EU interior ministers in Amsterdam on Thursday. The European Commission has proposed a scheme to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU countries. The UK has already said it will not take part in the scheme, but Ms Rudd's comments are the first time a minister has explicitly ruled out accepting any migrants under it. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We have been clear that we will not be accepting binding targets for the relocation of asylum seekers."" Ms Rudd said the UK would continue to work with the EU on other issues, such as tackling the causes of migration. But she said the UK's immigration policy was a matter for the British government and parliament. ""We will not be subject to EU decisions on our border controls or our immigration policy,"" she said. The government's decision not to participate in the migrant relocation scheme has been criticized by some, who say it is a moral obligation to help those who are fleeing war and persecution. Others have welcomed the decision, saying that the UK should not be forced to take in migrants who have no right to be here. The issue of migration is likely to be a key issue in the upcoming UK general election. The Conservative Party has pledged to reduce net migration to the UK to below 100,000 per year. The Labour Party has said it will ""review"" the government's immigration targets. The Liberal Democrats have said they will scrap the government's net migration target and introduce a new system based on skills. The UK's decision not to accept migrant relocation quotas is likely to put further strain on its relationship with the EU. The EU has said that the UK's refusal to participate in the scheme is ""unacceptable"". It is unclear what the long-term implications of the UK's decision will be. However, it is clear that the issue of migration will continue to be a source of tension between the UK and the EU.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Bank Holiday change will 'cost calendar maker £200,000'","Bank Holiday Change Will 'Cost Calendar Maker £200,000' A calendar maker has said that the government's decision to move the August bank holiday to September will cost his company £200,000. Robert Hall, co-founder of the Calendar Company, said that the change would mean that he would have to reprint all of his 2023 calendars, which are already in production. ""We're a small business, so this is a significant cost for us,"" he said. ""We had already printed 100,000 calendars when the government announced the change, and now we're going to have to scrap them all and start again."" The government announced in March that the August bank holiday would be moved to September from 2023 onwards. The change was made to mark the coronation of King Charles III, which is due to take place on 6 May 2023. The Calendar Company is one of the largest calendar makers in the UK, and it supplies calendars to a wide range of businesses and organizations. Hall said that he had received a number of calls from customers who were concerned about the change. ""Some of our customers have said that they will have to cancel their orders if we can't provide them with calendars that have the correct bank holidays,"" he said. ""We're doing everything we can to minimize the disruption, but it's going to be a challenge."" The government has said that it is aware of the impact that the change will have on businesses, and it is working to provide support. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We understand that businesses may need to make changes to their plans as a result of the bank holiday change. We are working with businesses to provide them with the support they need, and we have made funding available to help businesses with the costs of making these changes."" However, Hall said that the government's support was not enough to cover the costs that his company would incur. He said that he hoped that the government would reconsider the change or provide more financial support to businesses that are affected. ""We're a small business, and this change is going to have a big impact on us,"" he said. ""We're just asking the government to help us out.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Danube boat accident: More bodies found as vessel is raised in Hungary,"Danube Boat Accident: More Bodies Found as Vessel is Raised in Hungary The search and recovery operation following the tragic Danube River boat accident in Budapest has resumed, with more bodies being retrieved as the sunken vessel is raised. On Wednesday, the Mermaid sightseeing boat collided with the much larger Viking Sigyn cruise ship, causing it to capsize. Seven people died in the accident, including a South Korean tourist and a Hungarian crew member. Twenty-one people were rescued from the water, but several others remained unaccounted for. Authorities suspended the search on Thursday due to strong currents and poor visibility. On Friday, heavy lifting cranes were brought in to raise the Mermaid from the riverbed. As the vessel emerged from the water, divers discovered the bodies of five more victims. ""The search is still ongoing, but unfortunately, it is now a recovery operation,"" said Budapest police chief Peter Gergely. ""Our goal is to locate all of the victims and bring closure to their families."" The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but authorities have said that they are looking into several factors, including the weather conditions, the speed of the Viking Sigyn, and the condition of the Mermaid. The Viking Sigyn was traveling from Passau, Germany, to Budapest, Hungary, at the time of the accident. The Mermaid was carrying South Korean tourists who were on a sightseeing tour of the city. The accident has shocked Hungary and the international community. The Hungarian government has declared a day of mourning for the victims, and flags are flying at half-mast across the country. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and has called for a thorough investigation into the accident. The Danube River is one of Europe's busiest waterways, and boat accidents are relatively rare. However, this incident highlights the importance of safety measures and responsible navigation. As the search and recovery operation continues, authorities are urging the public to provide any information they may have about the accident. They are also asking for donations to support the families of the victims. The tragedy has cast a shadow over the city of Budapest, but the resilience and determination of the search and rescue teams have given hope to those who have lost loved ones.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny attacked with ""brilliant green"" dye","Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been attacked with a green antiseptic dye in the Siberian city of Barnaul. Footage on social media showed Navalny, who is currently on a campaign trip ahead of parliamentary elections next month, with his face and clothes covered in the dye. The substance, known as ""brilliant green,"" is commonly used as an antiseptic in Russia. Navalny said on social media that he had been attacked by members of ""Vladimir Putin's gang."" ""They sprayed my face with brilliant green and all my clothes,"" he said. ""I can't see out of one eye. They say that it will pass in a couple of days."" Navalny has been a vocal critic of Putin and has been arrested and imprisoned on several occasions. In 2020, he was poisoned with a nerve agent and was airlifted to Germany for treatment. He returned to Russia in January, despite knowing that he would likely be arrested. Navalny's team said he would continue his campaign tour, despite the attack. ""This is a sign that we are on the right track,"" they said in a statement. ""The authorities are afraid of us and they are trying to intimidate us."" The Kremlin has not commented on the attack. The attack on Navalny has been condemned by the United States and the European Union. The US State Department called the attack ""a cowardly attempt to silence"" Navalny.

Fastest-growing UK terror threat 'from far-right',"Far-right Extremism: A Growing Threat in the UK The far-right has emerged as the fastest-growing terror threat in the UK, according to a report by the National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NCTSO). This concerning trend is driven by a number of factors, including: Online Radicalization: Social media and online forums have become fertile ground for far-right ideologies to spread and radicalize individuals. Extremist groups are exploiting these platforms to share propaganda and recruit new members. Ideological Grievances: The far-right often taps into feelings of nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-immigration sentiments. Political events, such as Brexit, have further amplified these concerns, creating a breeding ground for far-right extremism. Economic Disparities: Economic inequality and social deprivation can also contribute to the growth of far-right extremism. Individuals who feel marginalized and unable to achieve economic success may turn to extreme ideologies that scapegoat minority groups. Threats to National Security: Far-right extremists pose a direct threat to national security. They are responsible for a significant number of terror attacks in the UK, including the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. These attacks involve the use of firearms, explosives, and other weapons. Countering the Threat: Tackling far-right extremism requires a multi-pronged approach: Law Enforcement: Law enforcement agencies are working to identify and disrupt far-right groups. This includes monitoring online activity, conducting raids, and arresting individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. Community Engagement: Building relationships with communities at risk of radicalization is crucial. Community groups, faith leaders, and schools can play a vital role in identifying vulnerable individuals and providing counter-narratives to extremist propaganda. Education and Awareness: Education campaigns are essential for raising awareness about far-right extremism. Schools, universities, and public organizations should provide resources and programs that promote tolerance, understanding, and critical thinking. Conclusion: The rise of far-right extremism in the UK is a serious threat to national security. It is driven by a complex mix of factors, including online radicalization, ideological grievances, and economic disparities. Countering this threat requires a concerted effort from law enforcement, communities, and educational institutions to identify and disrupt extremist groups and promote tolerance and understanding.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Plans to change NI prostitution and trafficking laws,"Northern Ireland's laws on prostitution and human trafficking are set to be overhauled in a bid to protect vulnerable people and crack down on organised crime. The Department of Justice has launched a consultation on a range of proposals, including: Decriminalising the purchase of sex by people who are not involved in prostitution Creating a new offence of paying for sex with a trafficked person Increasing the penalties for trafficking and exploiting people for sexual purposes The consultation, which runs until 23rd September, follows a review of the current laws, which were found to be outdated and ineffective. The current law on prostitution in Northern Ireland dates back to the 19th century and criminalises all aspects of sex work, including soliciting, kerb crawling and brothel keeping. This approach has been criticised by campaigners, who argue that it drives prostitution underground and makes it more dangerous for those involved. The new proposals would decriminalise the purchase of sex by people who are not involved in prostitution, while creating a new offence of paying for sex with a trafficked person. This would bring Northern Ireland into line with other jurisdictions, such as Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, which have decriminalised prostitution. The consultation also proposes increasing the penalties for trafficking and exploiting people for sexual purposes. This would include introducing a new offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation, which would carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Department of Justice said the proposed changes would ""make Northern Ireland a safer place for everyone"". ""We want to protect vulnerable people from exploitation and bring those who profit from their misery to justice,"" a spokesperson said. ""These proposals would modernise our laws and bring them into line with international best practice."" The consultation is open to all members of the public, and the Department of Justice is encouraging people to share their views. The results of the consultation will be used to inform the development of new legislation, which is expected to be introduced to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2024.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

"Trump sends family $25,000 after claim of broken promise","Former US President Donald Trump has reportedly sent $25,000 to each of his adult children after they accused him of breaking a promise to pay them $1 million apiece from his post-presidential fundraising efforts. The payments, which were made in February, were first reported by The New York Times. The Times reported that Trump's children - Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump - had been promised the money as part of an agreement they reached with their father in 2017. The agreement gave the children a stake in their father's business empire in exchange for their support during his presidential campaign. According to the Times, the children were expecting to receive the $1 million payments from the proceeds of Trump's post-presidential fundraising efforts. However, Trump's fundraising efforts have been less successful than expected, and he has been reluctant to use the money to pay his children. The children's decision to accuse Trump of breaking his promise is a sign of the growing tensions within the Trump family. The family has been divided over a number of issues, including Trump's decision to run for president again in 2024. The payments to his children are likely to further strain relations within the family. The children may see the payments as a sign that Trump is not willing to keep his promises to them. Trump, on the other hand, may see the payments as a way to buy their silence and keep them from speaking out against him. The payments also raise questions about Trump's financial situation. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is a billionaire, but there is evidence that his wealth is not as great as he has claimed. The payments to his children suggest that Trump may be facing financial difficulties. The payments to his children are the latest in a series of financial controversies involving Trump. Trump has been accused of tax fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. He is also facing a number of civil lawsuits related to his business dealings. The financial controversies surrounding Trump are likely to continue to be a source of scrutiny and investigation.

Basic rights of mentally ill 'violated',"Basic Rights of Mentally Ill Violated Individuals with mental illness face systemic violations of their basic human rights, according to a recent investigation by the BBC. The probe uncovered systematic failures in mental healthcare systems around the world, leading to widespread abuse and neglect. Denial of Autonomy One of the most fundamental violations is the denial of autonomy. People with mental illness are often subjected to forced treatment, including involuntary confinement and medication. This undermines their right to self-determination and can have severe psychological consequences. Inhumane Conditions Mental health facilities in many countries are overcrowded and underfunded, resulting in inhumane conditions. Patients are often housed in squalid, unsanitary wards and subjected to physical and psychological abuse by staff. Discrimination and Stigma Mentally ill individuals face widespread discrimination and stigma, which further marginalizes and isolates them. They may be denied employment, housing, and education solely based on their diagnosis. Lack of Access to Essential Services Access to essential mental healthcare services remains a major challenge. In many communities, there is a severe shortage of qualified professionals and facilities, making it difficult for people to receive timely and adequate care. Coercion and Restraint Coercive and restrictive practices are often used to control people with mental illness. These methods include physical restraints, seclusion, and chemical sedation. They can traumatize patients and exacerbate mental health conditions. Impacts on Human Rights These violations not only violate the rights of individuals with mental illness but also have broader societal consequences. They perpetuate stigma, erode public trust in mental healthcare systems, and contribute to social inequality. Call for Action The BBC investigation calls for urgent action to address these systemic failures. Governments, healthcare providers, and civil society organizations must work together to: Establish laws and policies that protect the rights of mentally ill individuals Invest in quality mental healthcare services Combat discrimination and stigma Promote recovery-oriented approaches that empower patients and respect their autonomy By ensuring the basic rights of mentally ill individuals, we can create a more just and equitable society that values the well-being of all its members.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Smart motorway death 'treated as PR exercise by transport minister',"Smart Motorway Death 'Treated as PR Exercise' by Transport Minister A grieving family has accused a government minister of treating their son's death on a smart motorway as a ""PR exercise."" Jason Mercer, 44, was killed on the M1 near Sheffield in June 2019 when his motorcycle collided with a stationary vehicle in a live lane. His parents, Philip and Carol Mercer, say Transport Secretary Grant Shapps failed to engage properly with their concerns about the safety of smart motorways. They claim he ignored their request for a meeting to discuss their son's death and instead sent them a letter offering ""sincere condolences."" The Mercers are among a growing number of families who are calling for the government to scrap smart motorways after a series of fatal accidents. Smart motorways are sections of road where the hard shoulder has been converted into a live lane, with traffic flow controlled by variable speed limits. Critics argue that the lack of a hard shoulder means there is nowhere for drivers to stop in the event of a breakdown or accident. In a letter to Mr. Shapps, Mr. Mercer said: ""I feel very let down by your response. It is clear that you have not taken the time to understand our concerns about smart motorways."" He said his son's death was ""completely avoidable"" and accused the government of putting ""profit before public safety."" Mr. Shapps has defended the safety of smart motorways, saying they are ""as safe, if not safer"" than traditional motorways. He has announced a £390 million investment to improve safety on smart motorways, including the installation of more emergency refuge areas and variable speed limits. However, the Mercers say these measures do not go far enough and are calling for all smart motorways to be converted back to traditional motorways with a hard shoulder. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Mercer's family for their tragic loss. We have received his letter and will respond to him directly."" The spokesperson added that the government is ""committed to improving the safety of smart motorways"" and that the £390 million investment ""will make a real difference.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sport Wales: Fewer pupils in deprived areas doing sport,"Sport Wales: Fewer Pupils in Deprived Areas Doing Sport A recent report by Sport Wales has revealed a worrying trend: children living in deprived areas of Wales are less likely to participate in sport than their more affluent peers. The report found that only 30% of children in the most deprived areas of Wales participate in sport at least once a week, compared to 47% of children in the most affluent areas. The report also found that there is a significant gap in the number of children who participate in sport outside of school hours. In the most deprived areas, only 15% of children participate in sport outside of school hours, compared to 33% in the most affluent areas. The report's findings are concerning, as sport has been shown to have a number of benefits for children, including improved physical health, mental well-being, and academic achievement. Sport can also help children to develop important life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and resilience. There are a number of reasons why children living in deprived areas are less likely to participate in sport. These include a lack of access to sports facilities, a lack of affordable sports equipment, and a lack of role models. Additionally, children living in deprived areas are more likely to face barriers to participation, such as poverty, crime, and family instability. The Welsh government has said that it is committed to tackling the issue of inequality in sport. In 2018, the government launched the £10m Active Schools Fund, which is designed to increase participation in sport in schools across Wales. The fund has been used to provide schools with new sports equipment, train teachers to deliver PE lessons, and develop after-school sports clubs. The government has also introduced a number of other initiatives to encourage children to participate in sport, such as the School Sports Partnership Programme and the National School Sports Awards. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all children in Wales have the opportunity to participate in sport. Recommendations The Sport Wales report makes a number of recommendations to address the issue of inequality in sport. These include: Increasing investment in sports facilities in deprived areas Providing more affordable sports equipment for children living in deprived areas Increasing the number of role models in deprived areas Developing more after-school sports clubs in deprived areas Breaking down barriers to participation for children living in deprived areas The Welsh government should take these recommendations seriously and implement them as soon as possible. By doing so, the government can help to ensure that all children in Wales have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of sport.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"South Korea to pardon 1,800 conscientious objectors","South Korea to Pardon 1,800 Conscientious Objectors In a significant move, the South Korean government has announced plans to pardon over 1,800 conscientious objectors who refused military service due to religious beliefs. The pardon, part of a wider push for greater social inclusivity, will provide relief and recognition to those who have faced discrimination and imprisonment for their pacifist stance. Conscientious objection is a fundamental human right protected by international law, but it is not recognized in South Korea. As a result, those who refuse military service on religious grounds have been prosecuted and sentenced to up to two years in prison. The announcement of the pardon has been welcomed by human rights groups and activists who have long campaigned for the recognition of conscientious objectors. They argue that the practice of imprisoning those who refuse to kill on ethical grounds is both unjust and counterproductive. ""This is a historic moment for South Korea,"" said Yoon Sang-jin, a spokesperson for the Conscientious Objectors' Movement. ""It shows that the government is finally willing to respect the rights of conscientious objectors."" The pardon process will begin immediately, and it is expected that most of the 1,800 eligible conscientious objectors will be released by the end of the year. Those pardoned will not be subject to any further penalties or restrictions and will be able to fully participate in society. While the pardon is a major step forward, it is not a complete solution. Conscientious objection is still not recognized as a valid ground for exemption from military service in South Korea. As a result, conscientious objectors will continue to face prosecution if they refuse to serve. Activists are calling on the government to go further and establish a permanent exemption system for conscientious objectors. Such a system would ensure that those who refuse military service on religious grounds are not penalized and can fully exercise their human rights. The decision to pardon 1,800 conscientious objectors is a testament to the growing recognition of the rights of pacifists in South Korea. It is a hopeful sign that the country is moving towards a more inclusive and tolerant society where all citizens are treated with respect and dignity.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Facebook launches initiative to fight online hate speech,"Facebook has launched a new initiative to combat online hate speech, as part of its ongoing efforts to make the platform a safer and more welcoming space for all users. The initiative, called ""We Delete Hate Speech,"" will see Facebook invest in new tools and technologies to identify and remove hate speech from its platform more quickly and effectively. The company will also work with experts in the field of hate speech to develop new strategies and approaches to combating this issue. Facebook has been under increasing pressure in recent months to do more to combat hate speech on its platform. In June, the company was criticized for its handling of hate speech targeting Muslims in Myanmar, which contributed to the ongoing violence in the country. In response to this criticism, Facebook has taken a number of steps to improve its response to hate speech. The company has increased the number of people working on safety and security issues, and it has developed new tools to identify and remove hate speech more quickly. The ""We Delete Hate Speech"" initiative is the latest step in Facebook's ongoing efforts to combat hate speech. The initiative will see the company invest in new tools and technologies, and it will work with experts in the field of hate speech to develop new strategies and approaches to combating this issue. Facebook is not the only company facing the challenge of online hate speech. Other social media companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, have also been criticized for their handling of this issue. However, Facebook is the largest social media company in the world, and it has a responsibility to lead the way in combating hate speech. The ""We Delete Hate Speech"" initiative is a welcome step in the right direction. It is clear that Facebook is taking this issue seriously, and it is committed to making its platform a safer and more welcoming space for all users. However, there is still more work to be done.

Brexit: Jaguar Land Rover extends shutdown over no-deal fears,"Jaguar Land Rover extends shutdown over no-deal Brexit fears Jaguar Land Rover has extended a shutdown at its Solihull plant for a further week as it grapples with the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit. The UK carmaker had previously announced plans to close the factory for two weeks from April 8, but has now said it will remain closed until April 29. The shutdown will affect around 2,500 workers at the plant, which produces the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models. Jaguar Land Rover said the extension was necessary to ""mitigate the risk of disruption"" caused by a no-deal Brexit. The company said it had been ""working hard"" to prepare for all possible outcomes, but added that it was ""impossible to mitigate all risks"" of a no-deal Brexit. ""We have taken the decision to extend the shutdown at our Solihull plant to ensure that we can continue to meet customer demand and protect the long-term competitiveness of our business,"" the company said in a statement. The news comes as the UK government continues to negotiate with the EU over a Brexit deal. The two sides are still deadlocked on a number of key issues, including the Irish border and the future of trade. There is growing concern that the UK could leave the EU without a deal on March 29, 2019. This would mean that there would be no transition period and the UK would immediately be subject to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The WTO rules would impose tariffs on goods traded between the UK and the EU, which would make it more expensive for companies to import and export goods. Jaguar Land Rover has warned that a no-deal Brexit could cost it £1.2bn a year in lost profits. The company has also said that it could be forced to cut jobs if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The shutdown of the Solihull plant is the latest sign of the impact that Brexit is having on the UK car industry. Nissan has already announced plans to cut production at its Sunderland plant, while Honda has said it will close its Swindon plant in 2021. The UK car industry is a major employer, with around 850,000 people working in the sector. The industry is also a key part of the UK economy, contributing around £18bn a year in tax revenue.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
South Yorkshire flooding: Clean-up starts in Bentley,"South Yorkshire flooding: Clean-up starts in Bentley Residents in Bentley, South Yorkshire, are starting to clear up after floodwaters devastated homes and livelihoods across the town.

More than 100 people were evacuated from their properties, and some are still unable to return. The clean-up operation is now underway, with residents and volunteers working together to remove debris and pump out floodwater. One resident, Jane Smith, said: ""It's heartbreaking to see the state of our homes. We've lost everything. But we're determined to pull together and rebuild our community.""

The current patchwork system is unworkable and is causing confusion and frustration. ""People are constantly having to check what the rules are in different parts of the UK, and it's making it difficult for businesses to operate. ""We need to have a single set of rules that apply across the whole of the UK.

The family tensions that taught Julian Fellowes about class,"In the tapestry of life, family ties intertwine, weaving intricate patterns of love, loyalty, and sometimes, tension. For Julian Fellowes, the celebrated creator of ""Downton Abbey,"" it was within the realm of his own family that he gained invaluable insights into the complexities of class and its profound impact on human relationships. Growing up in a family of contrasting backgrounds, Fellowes witnessed firsthand the subtle nuances and overt divides that existed between different social strata. His father, Peregrine Fellowes, was a member of the aristocracy, while his mother, Cynthia, hailed from a modest background. This dichotomy within his immediate family became a fertile ground for observing the intricate web of power, privilege, and prejudice that characterized British society. As a child, Fellowes often accompanied his father to grand country houses and stately homes. In these opulent settings, he absorbed the unspoken rules and customs of the upper classes. He witnessed their effortless elegance and the deference they expected from those below them. At the same time, through his mother, he experienced the warmth and hospitality of a more ordinary life, where people worked hard and valued community. The contrast between these two worlds left an indelible mark on Fellowes's psyche. He became acutely aware of the subtle cues and behaviors that signaled one's place in society. He learned to navigate the treacherous waters of class distinction, recognizing the unspoken expectations and prejudices that governed interactions between people. These early experiences laid the foundation for Fellowes's remarkable ability to portray class dynamics in his writing. In ""Downton Abbey,"" he deftly explores the tensions and complexities that arise when a family of aristocratic lineage encounters the changing social order of the early 20th century. Through the eyes of characters like Lady Mary and Mr. Carson, he examines the fading power of the aristocracy and the rise of a new middle class. Fellowes's writing is notable for its nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of characters from all walks of life. He avoids caricatures and stereotypes, instead illuminating the human truths that lie beneath the superficial differences of class. In ""Downton Abbey,"" the servants are as fully realized and complex as the aristocratic family they serve, each with their own dreams, ambitions, and vulnerabilities. The family tensions that Julian Fellowes experienced in his early life not only shaped his personal perspective but also provided him with an invaluable source of inspiration for his artistic endeavors. Through his writing, he continues to explore the enduring power of class and its influence on the human condition, offering audiences a profound and thought-provoking glimpse into this enduring aspect of society.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Migrant crisis: UK government response branded 'inadequate',"The UK government's response to the ongoing migrant crisis has been branded as ""inadequate"" by charities and opposition politicians. The criticism comes as the number of people crossing the English Channel in small boats continues to rise, with more than 40,000 having made the crossing so far this year. Charities have accused the government of failing to provide safe and legal routes for people to claim asylum in the UK, and of creating a ""hostile environment"" for migrants. Opposition politicians have also criticized the government's approach, saying that it is ""failing to get a grip"" on the crisis. The government has defended its record on migration, saying that it is ""committed to tackling the issue of illegal migration"" and that it is ""working closely with our international partners to find a solution."" However, critics say that the government's policies are not working and that the number of people crossing the Channel is only likely to increase in the future. The migrant crisis is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, the UK government's response has been widely criticized, and it is clear that more needs to be done to address the issue. One of the main criticisms of the government's approach is that it is too focused on deterrence. The government has introduced a number of measures to make it more difficult for people to cross the Channel, including increasing patrols and making it a criminal offense to help someone to cross the Channel illegally. However, critics say that these measures are not working and that they are only making the situation worse. They argue that deterrence measures do not address the root causes of migration and that they simply push people into taking more dangerous routes. Another criticism of the government's approach is that it is not doing enough to provide safe and legal routes for people to claim asylum in the UK. The government has reduced the number of asylum seekers who are allowed to come to the UK and has made it more difficult for people to claim asylum once they are here. Critics say that this is creating a ""hostile environment"" for migrants and that it is making it more difficult for people to seek protection in the UK. The UK government's response to the migrant crisis has been widely criticized. Critics say that the government's policies are not working and that they are only making the situation worse.

Mexican police officers arrested over migrant killings,"Mexican police officers have been arrested over the killings of migrants in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The victims were found in a mass grave in the city of San Fernando in 2010. The officers are accused of working with the Zetas drug cartel to kidnap and murder the migrants. The arrests come after a long investigation by the Mexican authorities. The investigation was supported by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The DEA provided intelligence and technical assistance to the Mexican authorities. The killings in San Fernando were part of a wave of violence against migrants in Mexico. In recent years, thousands of migrants have been kidnapped, extorted, and murdered by drug cartels. The cartels often target migrants who are trying to cross the border into the United States. The Mexican government has been criticized for its handling of the violence against migrants. Critics say that the government has not done enough to protect migrants or to investigate the crimes against them. The arrests of the police officers are a significant step forward in the fight against the violence against migrants in Mexico. However, there is still much work to be done.

Under-18s face alcohol search,"Under-18s Face Alcohol Search In a bid to curb underage drinking, police across the UK are launching a nationwide crackdown on stores selling alcohol to minors. The initiative, Operation Nexus, will see officers working with trading standards officers to conduct spot checks on shops suspected of flouting the law. Under-18s will be sent into shops to attempt to buy alcohol, while covert surveillance will be used to gather evidence against stores that fail to follow the rules. The move comes after a recent study found that one in four 15-year-olds in England had drunk alcohol in the past week. Alcohol Concern, a charity that works to reduce alcohol misuse, welcomed the crackdown. ""We know that young people who start drinking early are more likely to develop alcohol problems later in life,"" said Dr. James Nicholls, chief executive of Alcohol Concern. ""This operation is a welcome step towards protecting young people from the harms of alcohol."" The police operation will focus on stores that have a history of selling alcohol to minors, as well as those that are located in areas with high levels of underage drinking. Officers will also be working with local authorities to educate retailers about the law and the consequences of selling alcohol to minors. Anyone found selling alcohol to a minor could face a fine of up to £10,000, a prison sentence of up to six months, or both. The crackdown comes as part of a wider government strategy to reduce underage drinking. In 2014, the government introduced a new minimum unit price for alcohol, which is designed to make alcohol less affordable for young people. The government has also invested in prevention and education campaigns, which aim to raise awareness of the risks of underage drinking and encourage young people to make healthy choices. The police crackdown is expected to run for several months. It is hoped that the operation will help to reduce the number of young people who are drinking alcohol and to make it harder for minors to access alcohol. However, some critics have argued that the crackdown will not be effective. They say that young people will simply find other ways to get alcohol, such as through older friends or family members. Others have argued that the crackdown is unfair and that it will only serve to criminalize young people. They say that the focus should be on education and prevention, rather than on punishment.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Dr Michael Watt, 66, faces a number of allegations from the General Medical Council (GMC), including that he carried out breast examinations on three patients without their consent and that he failed to keep adequate medical records. Dr Watt, who worked at a surgery in Greenock, Inverclyde, has denied the allegations. A preliminary hearing in the case was held at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester on Thursday. At the hearing, the GMC's lawyer, Sarah Clarke, said that the allegations against Dr Watt were ""serious"" and that he had ""abused his position of trust"". She said that the GMC was seeking to have Dr Watt's name erased from the medical register, which would prevent him from practising medicine in the UK. However, Dr Watt's lawyer, David McKie, said that his client denied the allegations and that he would be contesting the charges. The tribunal chairman, Ian Martin, adjourned the hearing until 2020 to allow for further investigations to be carried out. The GMC has said that it will be calling a number of witnesses to give evidence at the hearing, including the three patients who made the allegations against Dr Watt. Dr Watt has been suspended from practising medicine since 2017. The allegations against Dr Watt first came to light in 2016, when a patient complained to the GMC that he had carried out a breast examination on her without her consent. Two other patients subsequently made similar allegations. The GMC launched an investigation into the allegations and concluded that there was a case to answer. Dr Watt was referred to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, which is an independent body that hears cases of alleged misconduct by doctors. The tribunal has the power to impose a range of sanctions, including erasure from the medical register. The allegations against Dr Watt are the latest in a series of cases of alleged misconduct by doctors in the UK. In recent years, a number of high-profile doctors have been struck off the medical register for carrying out unnecessary or inappropriate examinations. The GMC has said that it is committed to protecting patients from harm and that it will take action against any doctor who is found to have breached their professional standards.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
The whales who love to sing in the dark,"Beneath the pitch-black expanse of the deep ocean, a chorus of otherworldly sounds reverberates, weaving a symphony that defies human understanding. This clandestine orchestra belongs to a group of enigmatic whales known as the ""singing whales."" Deep beneath the ocean's surface, amidst a realm of eternal darkness, the singers gather. Their bodies, massive and majestic, glide through the water like shadowed phantoms. Their voices, a captivating blend of haunting melodies and ethereal harmonies, echo through the abyss, carrying messages and emotions across vast distances. Scientists have long been mesmerized by these nocturnal performances. Advanced underwater recording devices have revealed that the whales sing in complex and intricate patterns, often lasting for hours on end. Each song is unique to a particular pod or group of whales, creating a distinct sonic fingerprint that identifies them within the vast ocean. The reasons behind this mesmerizing behavior remain shrouded in mystery. Some researchers believe that the songs serve as a means of communication, allowing whales to maintain social bonds and navigate their underwater environment. Others suggest that the songs may play a role in courtship and reproduction, attracting potential mates with their enchanting melodies. Whatever the purpose, the singing whales have captured the hearts and imaginations of countless researchers, divers, and nature enthusiasts alike. Their voices, resonating through the depths, evoke a sense of wonder and awe, reminding us of the hidden wonders that lurk beneath the ocean's surface. One particularly captivating aspect of the singing whales' behavior is their choice to perform in the darkness. While many marine animals rely on vision for communication and navigation, these whales have adapted to thrive in the absence of light. Their songs, carried by sound waves, penetrate the darkness with remarkable clarity, allowing them to communicate and navigate effectively even in the most challenging of environments. The singing whales have become a symbol of resilience and adaptability, reminding us of the extraordinary capabilities that exist within the natural world. Their ability to thrive in the darkness, using their voices as a beacon of life, is a testament to the ingenuity and wonder that lies hidden within the ocean's depths.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Long Covid: Children of the 90s join nationwide study,"Long Covid: Children of the 90s join nationwide study The Children of the 90s study, which has been tracking the health of 14,000 people born in 1991 and 1992, is expanding to include research on long Covid. The study will follow up with participants who have had Covid-19 to see if they experience any long-term effects, such as fatigue, brain fog, or breathlessness. The research is being funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and will be led by the University of Bristol. Professor Russell Viner, who is leading the study, said: ""We know that adults can experience long-term effects from Covid-19, but we don't yet know if this is also the case for children."" ""This study will help us to understand the long-term health effects of Covid-19 in children, and to develop strategies to prevent and treat these effects."" The study will recruit participants who have had Covid-19, as well as a control group of participants who have not had the virus. Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and will also undergo a number of physical and cognitive tests. The study will follow up with participants for at least two years, and possibly longer, to track their health over time. The Children of the 90s study is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of child health in the world. The study has already provided valuable insights into a wide range of health issues, including obesity, mental health, and educational attainment. The addition of a long Covid research component to the study will provide important information about the long-term health effects of Covid-19 in children. This information will be essential for developing strategies to prevent and treat long Covid in children.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Eurozone business growth slows in September, PMI survey finds","Eurozone business growth slows in September, PMI survey finds Business growth in the eurozone slowed in September as new orders fell sharply amid rising economic uncertainty and the cost-of-living squeeze, a survey has found. The S&P Global Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.1 in September, down from 48.9 in August. This is the lowest reading since June 2020, when the eurozone was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. The PMI is a closely watched measure of business activity in the eurozone. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity, while a reading above 50 indicates growth. The survey found that new orders fell at the fastest pace since May 2020. This suggests that businesses are becoming increasingly cautious about the economic outlook and are reluctant to place new orders. The fall in new orders was particularly pronounced in the manufacturing sector, where the PMI fell to 46.8 in September, down from 49.1 in August. This is the lowest reading since May 2020. The services sector also saw a slowdown in growth, with the PMI falling to 49.2 in September, down from 49.8 in August. This is the lowest reading since March 2021. The survey also found that businesses are facing rising costs, with the input price index rising to 62.0 in September, up from 61.6 in August. This is the highest reading since June 2022. The rise in costs is putting pressure on businesses' profit margins, and is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers. Overall, the PMI survey suggests that the eurozone economy is slowing down as businesses become more cautious about the economic outlook. The rising cost of living is also weighing on consumer spending, which is likely to further dampen economic growth. The eurozone is facing a number of challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and the rising cost of living. These challenges are likely to continue to weigh on the economy in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Trayvon Martin texts and tweets limited in Zimmerman trial,"In the high-profile trial of George Zimmerman for the murder of Trayvon Martin, access to text messages and tweets sent by Martin has been tightly restricted by the judge, sparking debates over the relevance and fairness of this decision. The prosecution sought to introduce Martin's text messages and tweets as evidence, arguing that they would provide insight into his character and state of mind on the night of the shooting. However, the judge ruled that these communications were immaterial and would not be admissible. Supporters of the prosecution contended that Martin's texts and tweets would have shed light on his non-violent nature, contradicting the defense's portrayal of him as a threat to Zimmerman. They also argued that restricting access to these communications suppressed evidence that could have exonerated Martin. Conversely, the defense opposed the admission of Martin's texts and tweets, arguing that they were irrelevant to the charges against Zimmerman. They further contended that introducing these communications would open the door to speculation and prejudice, potentially tainting the jury's perception of the case. The judge ultimately sided with the defense, concluding that the potential for unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of Martin's texts and tweets. The judge's decision aligns with the general principle of excluding irrelevant evidence in criminal trials. However, some legal experts and commentators have questioned the fairness of this ruling. They argue that Martin's communications could have provided valuable context and nuance, helping the jury understand the events leading up to the shooting. Furthermore, concerns have been raised that the decision to exclude Martin's texts and tweets perpetuates a pattern of silencing victims in cases involving racial bias. Critics argue that by limiting access to evidence that could portray the victim favorably, the criminal justice system may be implicitly condoning the targeting of marginalized individuals. In conclusion, the decision to restrict access to Trayvon Martin's text messages and tweets in the Zimmerman trial has ignited a complex debate. While the judge's ruling is consistent with established legal principles, it has also raised questions about fairness and the potential impact on victims' rights. The implications of this decision will likely continue to be debated long after the trial has concluded.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

'Plebgate': Andrew Mitchell blasts media,"'Plebgate': Andrew Mitchell blasts media Andrew Mitchell has launched a stinging attack on the media, accusing them of orchestrating a ""political assassination"" and destroying his life. The former Conservative chief whip was at the centre of the 'Plebgate' scandal in 2012, when he was accused of calling Downing Street police officers ""plebs"". He was cleared of any wrongdoing by police, but the incident led to his resignation from the government. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mitchell said he had been the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by the media. He said: ""This was not about me making a mistake. This was about a political assassination, pure and simple. ""I was a danger. The media wanted me removed from office. They saw me as a problem, and they dealt with me."" Mitchell said the media had ""spun a yarn"" about what happened on the night in question. He said: ""They portrayed me as a monster, as someone who couldn't be allowed to hold public office. ""It was all lies. But the media had already made up their minds. They were going to get me, no matter what."" Mitchell said the scandal had had a devastating impact on his life. He said: ""I lost my job. I lost my reputation. I lost my family. ""I was a broken man. I thought I would never get my life back."" Mitchell said he had decided to speak out now because he wanted to ""set the record straight"". He said: ""I'm not going to let the media get away with what they did. ""I'm not going to let them destroy other people's lives like they destroyed mine."" Mitchell's comments come as a new book about the 'Plebgate' scandal is set to be published. The book, by investigative journalist Nick Davies, claims that the police officers involved in the incident were put under pressure to change their statements. Davies also alleges that the media were involved in a ""cover-up"" of the truth. Mitchell said he hoped the book would help to expose the ""lies"" that were told about him.

Walkers warned over dangers of cows in fields with calves,"Walkers warned over dangers of cows in fields with calves People are being warned about the dangers of cows in fields with calves after several incidents involving walkers being attacked. Cows will protect their young, and can become aggressive if they feel threatened. Even cows that are usually docile can become dangerous when they have calves. In the latest incident, a woman was walking her dog in a field in Devon when she was attacked by a cow. The woman was knocked to the ground and suffered serious injuries. The Countryside Code advises walkers to keep their dogs on a lead when walking in fields with cows and calves. But even if your dog is on a lead, it's important to be aware of the potential dangers and to take steps to avoid being attacked. If you see a cow with a calf, give it plenty of space and don't approach it. If the cow starts to approach you, back away slowly and calmly. Do not run, as this could trigger the cow's instinct to chase you. If you are attacked by a cow, try to protect yourself by curling up into a ball and covering your head and neck with your arms. Once the cow has moved away, get to a safe place and call for help. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has issued the following advice to walkers: Keep your dog on a lead when walking in fields with cows and calves. Give cows and calves plenty of space. Do not approach cows or calves. If a cow starts to approach you, back away slowly and calmly. If you are attacked by a cow, try to protect yourself by curling up into a ball and covering your head and neck with your arms. Once the cow has moved away, get to a safe place and call for help.

Guinea Ebola outbreak: Bat-eating banned to curb virus,"Guinea has banned the consumption of bats in a bid to curb the spread of the Ebola virus. The ban was announced by the country's health ministry on Monday, following the confirmation of a new case of Ebola in the southern Nzerekore region. Ebola is a deadly viral disease that is transmitted through contact with the blood or bodily fluids of infected animals or humans. Bats are known to be natural reservoirs of the virus, and eating their meat is considered to be a high-risk activity. The ban on bat consumption is part of a wider effort by the Guinean government to contain the outbreak of Ebola. Other measures include the establishment of screening centers at borders and airports, and the deployment of health workers to affected areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the ban on bat consumption, saying that it is an important step in reducing the risk of Ebola transmission. ""We know that bats are a natural reservoir of Ebola virus, and that eating bat meat is a risk factor for infection,"" said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO's Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response. ""This ban is an important step in reducing the risk of Ebola transmission and protecting the health of the Guinean people."" The Ebola outbreak in Guinea is the first in the country since 2016. The outbreak has so far killed at least 10 people, and there are fears that it could spread to other parts of the country. The WHO is working closely with the Guinean government to contain the outbreak and prevent its spread. The organization is providing technical support, including the deployment of experts to affected areas and the provision of essential supplies.

Hundreds of tonnes of clinical and human waste piles up,"Hundreds of tonnes of clinical and human waste are piling up at the UK's hospitals and care facilities, as a result of a waste management crisis caused by Brexit. The waste, which includes amputated limbs, blood bags, urine and faeces, is being stored in temporary containers, often outside hospitals. This is posing a health and safety risk, as it can attract vermin and spread infection. The crisis has been caused by the UK's exit from the European Union, which has led to changes in the way that waste is exported. Previously, the UK was able to send its clinical waste to other EU countries for incineration. However, since Brexit, this is no longer possible, and the UK has had to find alternative ways of disposing of its waste. The government has pledged to invest £100 million in new waste treatment facilities, but these will not be operational for several years. In the meantime, hospitals and care facilities are struggling to cope with the backlog of waste. The waste crisis is just one of the many challenges that the NHS is facing as a result of Brexit. The government has been criticised for failing to prepare for the changes that Brexit would bring, and for not providing adequate support to the NHS. The NHS is under immense pressure, and the waste crisis is only adding to the problems. The government needs to take urgent action to resolve the crisis and to ensure that the NHS has the resources it needs to provide safe and effective care. In addition to the health and safety risks, the waste crisis is also having a financial impact on the NHS. Hospitals and care facilities are having to pay more to dispose of their waste, and this is putting a strain on their budgets. The waste crisis is a serious issue that needs to be addressed urgently.

""Aleppo is the economic capital of Syria, and it's considered really the heart of Syria because of its location and the population that lives there,"" Assad said. ""If we finish the battle in Aleppo, this will be a great step towards winning the war, because it will be the biggest prize."" Assad's forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have been battling rebels for control of Aleppo since 2012. The city has been divided into rebel-held east and government-held west since then. In recent months, Assad's forces have made significant gains, capturing several rebel-held districts and cutting off supply routes to the remaining rebel-held areas. The rebels have been weakened by the loss of their main supply route and by the Russian airstrikes. However, they still control a significant part of eastern Aleppo and have vowed to continue fighting. Assad said he was not interested in a ceasefire in Aleppo and that he wanted to see the rebels defeated.

Why more vegetarians don't become vegans,"Why More Vegetarians Don't Become Vegans Despite the growing popularity of veganism, many vegetarians remain steadfast in their avoidance of meat and fish while continuing to consume other animal products. While there are numerous reasons for this discrepancy, several key factors stand out. Cultural and Social Barriers: Traditions and cultural norms play a significant role in shaping food choices. In many societies, dairy and eggs are deeply ingrained in culinary practices and are often viewed as essential components of a balanced diet. Breaking away from these ingrained habits can be challenging, especially when social gatherings and family meals revolve around animal-based foods. Taste and Convenience: Dairy products, such as cheese, butter, and milk, add richness, flavor, and texture to dishes. Eggs provide a convenient and versatile ingredient for baking, cooking, and breakfast. Many vegetarians find it difficult to give up these familiar and flavorful foods. Additionally, vegan alternatives may not always be readily available or may not match the taste and texture of their animal-based counterparts. Nutritional Concerns: Some vegetarians express concerns about meeting their nutritional needs without animal products. Calcium, vitamin B12, and essential fatty acids, such as omega-3s, are among the nutrients that vegans must pay careful attention to. While these nutrients can be obtained from fortified foods or supplements, the task of ensuring a balanced vegan diet can be perceived as daunting. Personal Values: While ethical concerns are often a primary motivator for vegetarianism, veganism takes a more comprehensive approach. Vegans reject the use of all animal products, including those used in clothing, cosmetics, and entertainment. This broader perspective may not resonate with all vegetarians, who may have different ethical boundaries or priorities. Food Security: For some individuals, vegetarianism may simply represent a more manageable step towards reducing their animal consumption. Adopting a fully vegan diet can be expensive, time-consuming, and may not be feasible for those with limited access to vegan food options or who live in food-insecure environments. Lifestyle and Identity: Vegetarianism has become increasingly mainstream and is often associated with health consciousness and environmentalism. For some individuals, identifying as a vegetarian may provide a sense of belonging or fulfill their ethical concerns without requiring a complete overhaul of their lifestyle. In conclusion, while ethical considerations and health concerns often drive vegetarianism, a combination of cultural, social, practical, and personal factors influences why many vegetarians do not transition to veganism. Addressing these barriers, providing accessible and affordable vegan options, and fostering a greater understanding of the ethical implications of animal consumption are key to promoting a more plant-based future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Putin to cut Russian imports of Western goods with new fund,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced plans to establish a new fund to replace imports of goods from Western countries. The fund is aimed at stimulating domestic production and reducing reliance on imports. The fund, which will be set up with an initial capital of 1 trillion rubles ($14 billion), will provide loans and other financial assistance to Russian companies that manufacture goods that are currently being imported from Western countries. The move is seen as a response to the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia by the West in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Putin said that the fund will help to create new jobs and boost economic growth. He said that it is time for Russia to become more self-reliant and to reduce its dependence on imports. The fund will be managed by the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade. The ministry will be responsible for identifying the sectors and companies that will receive funding. The Kremlin has said that the fund is part of a broader strategy to make the Russian economy more independent. The strategy includes measures to boost domestic production, to increase exports, and to attract foreign investment. The fund is likely to have a significant impact on the Russian economy. It will provide a major boost to domestic production and will help to reduce Russia's reliance on imports. The fund could also help to create new jobs and to boost economic growth. However, there are some concerns about the fund. Some economists have warned that it could lead to inflation if it is not managed properly. Others have said that it could be used to prop up inefficient companies. The fund is a major step towards making the Russian economy more independent. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be successful in achieving its goals. In addition to the fund, Putin also announced a number of other measures to support the Russian economy. These measures include: 1. A reduction in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 20% to 10%. 2. A moratorium on bankruptcy proceedings for companies that are struggling financially. 3. An increase in the minimum wage by 10%. These measures are aimed at stimulating economic growth and supporting businesses and consumers during the current economic crisis.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Artists talk of mental health issues in music industry,"In the vibrant tapestry of the music industry, where melodies soar and rhythms pulse, a sobering undercurrent flows: the prevalence of mental health struggles. Artists, the creative souls who give voice to our emotions, are often at the forefront of this battle, grappling with the pressures of fame, the weight of expectations, and the toll of navigating a demanding industry. Lily Allen, a singer-songwriter known for her candid and confessional lyrics, has spoken openly about her struggles with depression and anxiety. ""I felt like I was in a constant state of fight or flight,"" she revealed. ""I couldn't sleep, my mind was racing, and I was constantly on edge."" Lady Gaga, a global superstar, has also shed light on the mental health challenges she has faced. In 2019, she disclosed her diagnosis of fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition that often co-occurs with depression and anxiety. ""I've battled with mental health issues for a long time,"" she shared. ""It affects every aspect of my life, from my creativity to my relationships."" The demands of the music industry can exacerbate these struggles. Constant touring, relentless pressure to create new material, and the scrutiny of fans and critics can take a heavy toll on artists' well-being. ""It's like being on a rollercoaster that never stops,"" said Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter who has been open about his experiences with anxiety. ""There's always another show, another interview, another album deadline. It can be relentless."" Some artists have found solace in their music, using it as an outlet for their emotions and a way to connect with others who may be struggling. ""Music has saved me in many ways,"" said Demi Lovato, a singer-songwriter who has faced addiction and mental health challenges. ""It's a way for me to express my pain, my joy, and everything in between. It helps me feel less alone."" However, the stigma surrounding mental health in the music industry persists. Some artists fear that speaking out about their struggles may damage their careers or alienate their fans. ""There's still a lot of shame and misunderstanding around mental health,"" said Halsey, a singer-songwriter who has been vocal about her bipolar disorder. ""People need to understand that it's not a sign of weakness. It's a real condition that affects millions of people."" As the conversation around mental health in the music industry grows, artists are playing a vital role in breaking down barriers and promoting understanding. By sharing their experiences and advocating for support, they are helping to destigmatize mental health and create a more compassionate and supportive environment for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Focus on quality of early education, politicians urged","Politicians Urged to Prioritize Quality of Early Education Amidst rising concerns about the long-term effects of the pandemic on children's development, political leaders are being strongly urged to focus on improving the quality of early education. New evidence suggests that high-quality early education can have profound and enduring benefits for children, helping to lay a solid foundation for their future success. Studies have demonstrated that children who participate in quality early learning programs are more likely to perform better academically, have stronger social and emotional skills, and enjoy better health outcomes throughout their lives. Despite its importance, early education in many countries faces significant challenges, including a shortage of well-trained educators, a lack of adequate funding, and a fragmented regulatory landscape. The pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, with the closure of childcare centers and the disruption of home visiting services. Addressing these challenges requires urgent action from policymakers. Experts are calling for increased investment in early education, with a focus on improving quality standards and supporting the professional development of educators. They also advocate for the creation of comprehensive early childhood development systems that seamlessly connect services and provide support to families from pregnancy to school entry. ""The time has come to recognize early education as an essential investment in our children's future,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a child development expert. ""By prioritizing quality early education, we can help to ensure that every child has the opportunity to thrive and succeed."" The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp relief the importance of high-quality early education. With many children experiencing significant disruptions to their early learning, there is a growing concern about the potential long-term consequences. ""The early years are a critical period for brain development,"" explained Professor Anne Jones, a neuroscientist. ""Children who experience high-quality early education develop stronger neural connections and have better cognitive outcomes than those who do not."" In addition to its cognitive benefits, early education also plays a vital role in children's social and emotional development. Quality early education programs provide children with safe and nurturing environments where they can learn to interact with others, develop self-regulation skills, and form healthy attachments. ""Early education is not just about preparing children for academic success,"" said Dr. Mary Brown, a psychologist. ""It's also about giving them the social and emotional foundation they need to thrive in life."" As political leaders across the country grapple with the challenges of post-pandemic recovery, it is imperative that they prioritize quality early education. By investing in our youngest learners, we can not only mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic but also lay the foundation for a brighter future for our children.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Lothian Buses suspends evening services following attacks,"Lothian Buses has suspended evening services in parts of Edinburgh following a spate of attacks on its vehicles. The move comes after a number of incidents in recent weeks, including one in which a bus was set on fire. The company said the decision to suspend services was taken ""with a heavy heart"" but that it had to prioritize the safety of its staff and customers. The suspension will affect services in the following areas: Gilmerton Liberton Craigmillar Niddrie Broomhouse Wester Hailes Muirhouse Pilton Granton Leith The last buses will leave the city center at 8pm on the affected routes. Lothian Buses said it was working with Police Scotland to investigate the attacks and that it was committed to resuming services as soon as possible. In the meantime, the company has urged customers to use alternative modes of transport, such as taxis or private hire vehicles. The suspension of services has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some have welcomed the move, saying that it is necessary to protect bus drivers and passengers. Others have expressed concern about the impact it will have on people who rely on public transport to get around. One resident of Gilmerton, who did not want to be named, said: ""I understand why Lothian Buses has made this decision, but it's going to make it really difficult for people to get home from work or social events. I'm going to have to start taking taxis, which is going to be a lot more expensive."" Another resident, who lives in Leith, said: ""I'm really disappointed that the buses are being suspended. I use the bus every day to get to work and back, and now I'm going to have to find a different way to get around. It's going to be a major inconvenience.""

Tory MSP joins calls for 'federal' UK in wake of Brexit vote,"In the aftermath of the tumultuous Brexit referendum, the political landscape of the United Kingdom has been thrown into disarray. Amidst the uncertainty and division, a growing chorus of voices is calling for a fundamental restructuring of the UK's constitutional arrangements, with some advocating for a shift towards a more federal system of government. Among those adding their weight to this movement is Adam Tomkins, a Conservative MSP (Member of the Scottish Parliament). Tomkins has argued that a federal UK, with greater devolution of powers to the constituent nations of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, could help to address the deep-seated grievances that have fueled support for independence in some parts of the country. Proponents of federalism argue that it offers a way to accommodate the diverse needs and aspirations of different regions while preserving the overall unity of the UK. By granting greater autonomy to devolved administrations, they contend, it would reduce the sense of alienation felt by many in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, critics of federalism warn that it could lead to a weakening of the UK government and a fragmentation of the country. They argue that devolving more powers to regional assemblies could undermine the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and create a disjointed and inefficient system of governance. The debate over federalism is likely to intensify in the coming months and years as the UK navigates the uncharted waters of Brexit. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on the future shape of the United Kingdom, determining whether it remains a centralized state or embraces a more decentralized and federal model of governance. It is worth noting that the idea of a federal UK is not a new one. In the early 20th century, there were significant movements in Scotland and Wales advocating for greater autonomy. In recent years, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has made federalism a central plank of its platform, arguing that it would allow Scotland to remain part of the UK while having greater control over its own affairs. Whether or not the UK ultimately adopts a federal system of government remains to be seen. However, the growing momentum behind this idea suggests that it is a debate that is likely to continue for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Sean Turner: 'Lost opportunities' in care, rules inquest","A coroner has concluded that there were ""lost opportunities"" to intervene in the care of a man who died following a cardiac arrest in a mental health unit. Sean Turner, 30, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and had been admitted to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton in May 2021 after expressing suicidal thoughts. An inquest into his death heard that he had missed several appointments with mental health services in the months leading up to his admission. The inquest also heard that Mr. Turner had been prescribed a number of medications, including antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, there was no evidence that he had taken any of these medications as prescribed. On the day of his death, Mr. Turner was found unresponsive in his room at the hospital. He was taken to the intensive care unit, where he died the following day. A post-mortem examination found that Mr. Turner had died from a cardiac arrest caused by a combination of factors, including obesity, sleep apnea, and the effects of drug use. The inquest heard that Mr. Turner had a history of drug and alcohol misuse. He had also been diagnosed with epilepsy and had learning disabilities. The coroner concluded that there had been a number of ""lost opportunities"" to intervene in Mr. Turner's care. He said that there had been a lack of communication between different services involved in his care, and that this had led to delays in him receiving appropriate treatment. The coroner also said that there was a need for better training for staff working in mental health units in how to manage patients with complex needs. He made a number of recommendations to improve the care of patients with mental health problems, including: Improved communication between different services involved in a patient's care Earlier intervention for patients with complex needs Better training for staff working in mental health units The coroner also recommended that the government review the current system of care for people with mental health problems.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Philippines president pledges Manila bus siege inquiry,"Philippines President Pledges Manila Bus Siege Inquiry Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has vowed to conduct a thorough investigation into the deadly bus siege in Manila that claimed the lives of at least 25 people. Speaking to reporters at the scene of the incident, Marcos expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and condemned the attack. ""This is a cowardly and senseless act of violence that has no place in our society,"" Marcos said. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice."" The siege began on Monday when a former policeman, identified as Rolando Mendoza, boarded a public bus in the Manila suburb of Pasay. Mendoza then took all the passengers hostage, demanding the reinstatement of his job in the police force. Authorities responded to the incident and attempted to negotiate with Mendoza. However, after several hours of unsuccessful negotiations, police stormed the bus, ending the siege. Mendoza and 24 hostages were killed in the operation. Marcos said that the investigation into the siege would focus on several key areas, including the police response to the incident, the motive behind the attack, and the screening process for police officers.

Trump wiretap claims: Senator makes subpoena threat to FBI,"In a dramatic escalation of the clash between the Trump administration and Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham has threatened to subpoena the FBI over the President's claims that his phones were wiretapped by former President Barack Obama. Graham, a Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would issue the subpoena if the FBI did not provide his panel with documents and testimony related to the wiretapping allegations. ""We're going to subpoena the FBI if we don't get the information we need,"" Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""We're not going to stand for this."" The FBI has denied the President's claims, and there is no evidence to support them. But Trump has continued to repeat the allegations, and he has accused the FBI of being biased against him. Graham's threat is a significant development, as it marks the first time that a Republican lawmaker has publicly threatened to subpoena the FBI over the wiretapping allegations. It is also a sign of the growing frustration among some Republicans with the Trump administration's handling of the Russia investigation. Trump has repeatedly attacked the FBI, and he has called for the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Comey has been leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he has been critical of Trump's handling of the probe. Graham's threat is likely to put further pressure on the FBI to provide Congress with more information about the wiretapping allegations. It could also lead to a showdown between the FBI and Congress, as the FBI has indicated that it is not willing to provide Congress with all of the information it has related to the investigation. The wiretapping allegations are just one of a number of issues that are causing tension between the Trump administration and Congress. Congress is also investigating the Trump administration's ties to Russia, and it is looking into the President's business dealings. The Trump administration has been accused of stonewalling Congress's investigations, and it has refused to provide Congress with some of the documents and testimony that it has requested. The clash between the Trump administration and Congress is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. It is unclear how the conflict will be resolved, but it is clear that the two branches of government are on a collision course.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Trump lawyer 'pressed Oval Office to release gold dealer',"Revelations in the House January 6 Committee's final report allege that former President Donald Trump's lawyer, John Eastman, pressured senior White House staff in the waning days of his administration to release a gold dealer who was arrested with $2 million in gold bars. According to the report released on December 20, 2022, Eastman made multiple calls to the White House Counsel's Office, urging the release of the dealer, who was identified as Nicolas Goureau. Goureau was arrested by the FBI on January 6, 2021, on suspicion of smuggling gold from Guinea to the United States. The report states that Eastman argued that Goureau's release was necessary to secure evidence related to alleged election fraud. This was a strategy pursued by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. However, senior White House staff, including Pat Cipollone, declined to intervene in the case, citing concerns about the legality of such a move. The Department of Justice also opposed the release of Goureau, arguing that he posed a flight risk and was involved in criminal activity. The report's findings raise questions about the extent to which Trump and his allies were willing to go to undermine the rule of law in the aftermath of the 2020 election. It also suggests that Eastman may have been involved in a broader effort to use the Justice Department to advance Trump's personal and political interests. In addition to the allegations regarding Goureau, the January 6 Committee report also detailed Eastman's efforts to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results. Eastman argued that Pence had the authority to reject electoral votes from states where Trump alleged widespread fraud, but Pence ultimately declined to do so. The committee's report is a comprehensive account of the events leading up to and including the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The report has been praised by some for its thoroughness and damning conclusions, while others have criticized it for its partisan nature. The Justice Department is currently investigating Eastman's actions, as well as those of other Trump allies who were involved in efforts to overturn the election results. It is unclear whether Eastman will face criminal charges, but the report's findings may provide the basis for further legal action.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Brexit worker issues 'could shut offshore platforms',"Brexit worker issues 'could shut offshore platforms' amid fears thousands of jobs could be lost due to new rules. The oil and gas industry has warned that new immigration rules could lead to the closure of offshore platforms in the UK, with the loss of thousands of jobs. Under the new rules, which came into effect on 1 January 2021, EU citizens who want to work in the UK need to have a job offer that pays a minimum salary of £25,600 and have a certain level of English language proficiency. The industry says that these requirements will make it difficult to recruit and retain the skilled workers it needs, particularly in remote locations such as offshore platforms. A survey by industry body Oil & Gas UK found that 80% of companies are concerned about the impact of the new rules on their ability to operate. One company, which operates a number of offshore platforms in the North Sea, said that it could be forced to close one of its platforms if it is unable to recruit enough skilled workers. The company said that it needs to recruit around 100 new workers each year, but that it is now struggling to fill these vacancies. ""The new immigration rules are making it very difficult for us to recruit the skilled workers we need,"" said a spokesman for the company. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact of the new rules on our ability to operate our offshore platforms, which are essential to the UK's energy security."" The government has said that it is aware of the concerns of the oil and gas industry and is working to address them. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ""We are working with the oil and gas industry to ensure that they have access to the skilled workers they need."" ""We have already made a number of changes to the immigration rules to help the industry, including reducing the minimum salary requirement for skilled workers in shortage occupations."" However, the industry says that more needs to be done. ""The government needs to do more to address the concerns of the oil and gas industry,"" said Mike Tholen, the CEO of Oil & Gas UK. ""The new immigration rules are a serious threat to the UK's energy security and the government needs to take action to ensure that the industry has access to the skilled workers it needs.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Plea to park safely to help guide dogs and their owners,"Plea to park safely to help guide dogs and their owners Guide dogs provide invaluable assistance to people with sight loss, helping them navigate the world safely and confidently. However, inconsiderate parking can create significant obstacles for these dogs and their owners. When parking, it's crucial to leave enough space for guide dogs to pass safely. This means avoiding parking too close to dropped kerbs, pedestrian crossings, and any areas where guide dogs need to manoeuvre. Blocking dropped kerbs forces guide dogs and their owners to navigate busy roads without the protection of a tactile surface. Similarly, parking near pedestrian crossings prevents them from using the audible signals that help them cross safely. In addition to leaving adequate space, it's important to avoid parking on pavements. Guide dogs rely on pavements as their safe zone, as they can confidently walk along them without fear of obstacles. Parking on pavements forces them into the road, exposing them to traffic and other hazards. Parking safely not only benefits guide dogs and their owners but also contributes to a more inclusive society. By creating a more accessible environment, we can ensure that people with sight loss can participate fully in community life. Guide dogs and their owners often have a specific routine, and inconsiderate parking can disrupt this routine and cause stress and anxiety. For example, if a guide dog and its owner are used to crossing at a particular pedestrian crossing but a car is parked too close, they may have to go a long way out of their way to find another crossing point. There are a number of simple things drivers can do to help guide dogs and their owners: Leave enough space for guide dogs to pass safely at dropped kerbs, pedestrian crossings, and pavements. Avoid parking on pavements. Be aware of guide dogs and their owners when you are driving. Give them plenty of space and time to cross the road. By following these simple guidelines, drivers can make a significant difference to the lives of guide dogs and their owners. It's a small gesture that can make a big impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Suicide in men 'highest since 2001',"Suicide in Men 'Highest Since 2001' Suicide rates among men in England and Wales have reached their highest level since 2001, new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. There were 5,691 suicides registered in 2021, up from 5,239 in 2020. This represents a rate of 16.6 deaths per 100,000 men, compared to 4.9 per 100,000 women. The increase in male suicides follows a long-term trend that has seen rates rise since the early 1980s. In 2001, the rate was 15.5 deaths per 100,000 men. The ONS figures show that suicide is the leading cause of death for men under the age of 50. In 2021, there were 1,635 suicides among men aged 20-49, a rate of 24.9 deaths per 100,000. The reasons for the rise in male suicide rates are complex and not fully understood. However, some factors that have been linked to suicide include: Mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety Substance abuse Financial difficulties Relationship problems Work-related stress The ONS figures also show that suicide rates vary significantly across different parts of England and Wales. The highest rates are in the North East of England, where there were 20.9 deaths per 100,000 men in 2021. The lowest rates are in the South East, where there were 12.7 deaths per 100,000 men. Experts have called for more to be done to prevent suicide among men. This includes investing in mental health services, providing support for people with financial difficulties, and raising awareness of the issue.

Woman hatches ducks from Waitrose eggs,"A woman from Devon has successfully hatched six ducklings from eggs she bought at her local Waitrose supermarket. Becky Goldsmith, from Topsham, decided to try hatching eggs after seeing a video online. She bought 12 duck eggs from Waitrose and put them in an incubator. To her surprise, six of the eggs hatched and she now has six healthy ducklings. Becky said: ""I was really surprised when they hatched. I didn't think they would because they were from the supermarket. ""But they're all doing really well now. They're eating and drinking and they're starting to grow feathers."" Becky has named the ducklings after characters from the Winnie the Pooh stories. She said: ""I've called them Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger, Rabbit and Owl. ""They're all really cute and I'm really enjoying looking after them."" Becky is now planning to keep the ducklings until they are old enough to be released into the wild. She said: ""I'm going to keep them for a few months until they're big enough to look after themselves. ""Then I'll release them into a local pond."" A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""We're delighted to hear that Becky has been able to hatch ducklings from our eggs. ""We sell a wide range of fresh eggs, including duck eggs, and we're always happy to hear from our customers about their experiences with our products."" Experts say that it is possible to hatch ducklings from supermarket eggs, but it is not always successful. They say that the eggs need to be fresh and fertile, and they need to be incubated at the correct temperature and humidity. If the eggs are not incubated correctly, the ducklings may not hatch or they may be born with deformities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Asian markets rally on Covid-19 vaccine hopes,"Asian markets rallied on Monday on growing optimism over progress in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine. The positive sentiment was boosted by news that Moderna's vaccine candidate had shown promising results in early-stage human trials. The US biotech firm said its vaccine produced antibodies in all 45 volunteers who were given two doses, and that no serious side effects were reported. The news sent Moderna's shares soaring by more than 25% in pre-market trading. It also lifted other stocks in the healthcare sector, with shares in Pfizer and BioNTech, which are also developing a vaccine, rising by more than 5%. The positive sentiment spread to Asian markets, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan closing up 1.7%, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rising 1.5%, and the Shanghai Composite Index in China gaining 1.2%. Analysts said the news about Moderna's vaccine was a major boost for investors, who have been looking for positive news on the Covid-19 front. ""The Moderna news is a very positive development,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. ""It gives investors hope that a vaccine could be available sooner rather than later."" However, analysts also cautioned that it was still too early to tell whether Moderna's vaccine would be effective and safe in the long term. ""We need to see the results of larger trials before we can be sure that the vaccine is effective,"" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. ""But the news from Moderna is definitely a step in the right direction."" The rally in Asian markets also came on the back of positive economic data from China. The country's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.6 in May, up from 50.1 in April. This was the first time the PMI had risen above 50 since December 2019, indicating that the Chinese economy is starting to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The positive economic data from China also helped to boost investor sentiment in other Asian markets. ""The PMI data from China is another sign that the global economy is starting to recover,"" said Varathan. ""This is good news for Asian markets, which are heavily dependent on trade with China."" Overall, the positive news on the Covid-19 vaccine front and the improving economic data from China helped to boost investor sentiment in Asian markets on Monday.

Selfridges to offer clothing rental in environmental push,"Selfridges to Offer Clothing Rental in Environmental Push In a major move to promote sustainable fashion, luxury department store Selfridges is launching a clothing rental service. The initiative, called ""The Rental,"" will offer customers the opportunity to borrow designer pieces for a monthly fee, rather than buying them outright. The move comes amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of the fashion industry. The production and disposal of clothing generates significant amounts of greenhouse gases, water pollution, and waste. By encouraging customers to rent rather than buy, Selfridges hopes to reduce its environmental footprint. The Rental will feature a curated collection of over 500 pieces from various luxury brands, including Victoria Beckham, Stella McCartney, and Alexander McQueen. Customers can rent items for a period of four, eight, or twelve weeks, and can choose to have them delivered to their homes or picked up in-store. To ensure the longevity of the rented garments, Selfridges has partnered with leading clothing care company Oxwash. Oxwash uses eco-friendly cleaning methods and repairs items as needed to keep them in pristine condition. Selfridges' decision to offer a clothing rental service is part of a broader strategy to promote sustainable practices. The department store has already implemented a number of initiatives, including banning single-use plastics, reducing energy consumption, and supporting ethical suppliers. The launch of The Rental has been welcomed by environmental groups. ""This is a positive step towards making the fashion industry more sustainable,"" said Sarah Kent, head of campaigns at Greenpeace UK. ""By offering clothing rental, Selfridges is making it easier for consumers to reduce their environmental impact."" Customers have also expressed enthusiasm for the new service. ""I'm really excited about The Rental,"" said Sarah Jones, a Selfridges customer. ""It's a great way to access designer fashion without breaking the bank or harming the environment."" The Rental is expected to be a major success for Selfridges. The department store believes that the service will appeal to a wide range of customers, including those who are looking to reduce their environmental impact, those who want to experiment with different styles, and those who are looking for a more affordable way to access designer fashion.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nine Journalists killed since 2006 - Dinesh,"Nine Journalists Killed Since 2006 - Dinesh Dinesh Kumar Upadhyay, a freelance journalist from Madhya Pradesh, India, was brutally murdered on January 24, 2023. He became the ninth journalist killed in the country since 2006, highlighting the dangerous and often deadly climate for journalists in India. Dinesh's life was tragically cut short at the age of 44. He was known for his fearless reporting on corruption, crime, and social issues in his home state. His murder shocked his family, colleagues, and the entire journalistic community. The motive behind Dinesh's murder remains unclear, but it is widely believed that his work as a journalist played a role. He had been facing threats and intimidation for years and had recently filed a complaint with the police about the harassment he was experiencing. Dinesh's murder is a stark reminder of the risks journalists face when they dare to speak truth to power. Journalists in India operate in an atmosphere of fear, where physical attacks, threats, and legal harassment are not uncommon. Since 2006, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has documented the murders of nine journalists in India: 2006: Chandrasekaran Balasubramaniam, Tamil Nadu 2007: Sai Reddy, Andhra Pradesh 2010: Jagendra Singh, Uttar Pradesh 2012: Rajesh Verma, Chhattisgarh 2013: Akhilesh Pratap Singh, Bihar 2015: Gauri Lankesh, Karnataka 2017: Shantanu Bhowmick, Tripura 2018: Shubham Mani Tripathi, Uttar Pradesh 2023: Dinesh Kumar Upadhyay, Madhya Pradesh The CPJ believes that these journalists were killed because of their work, making India one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists. The killings of journalists in India have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Journalists are afraid to report on sensitive issues or challenge powerful figures for fear of retaliation. This undermines democracy and the public's right to know. The Indian government has a responsibility to ensure the safety of journalists and to hold those responsible for their murders accountable. If the government fails to take action, the killings of journalists will continue, silencing voices and stifling dissent.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"More than 60,000 waiting to join Scouts amid 'volunteer shortage'","Amidst a surge in youth enrollment, the iconic youth organization, the Scouts, grapples with a concerning shortage of adult volunteers, leaving over 60,000 young individuals eager to join but unable to do so. The Scouts, renowned for fostering leadership, teamwork, and outdoor adventure, has seen a surge in applications. However, the organization's ability to accommodate these aspiring Scouts is severely hindered by the lack of adult volunteers to lead and supervise groups. ""We have a real crisis on our hands,"" said Matt Hyde, the Scouts' chief executive. ""The demand for Scouting is soaring, but we simply don't have enough adults to make it happen."" The volunteer shortage stems from a variety of factors, including societal changes, increased demands on time, and a lack of awareness about the benefits of volunteering with the Scouts. ""People are busier than ever these days, and it can be hard to find the time to volunteer,"" said Hyde. ""But the Scouts is an incredibly rewarding experience, both for the young people and for the adults who support them."" Compounding the challenge is a decline in traditional recruitment methods. Once upon a time, many adults would learn about Scouting through their children or by attending local events. However, with the rise of social media and other digital distractions, it has become more difficult to reach potential volunteers. The lack of adult volunteers is not only preventing young people from joining the Scouts but also impacting existing groups. With fewer adults to lead and supervise activities, some units have been forced to reduce their programs or even close down. ""It's heart-wrenching to see young people so eager to join the Scouts but not being able to because we don't have the adults to support them,"" said Hyde. ""We need people to step forward and help us give these young people the chance to experience all that the Scouts has to offer."" The Scouts is appealing for adults from all walks of life to consider volunteering. No prior Scouting experience is necessary, and flexible volunteering options are available to accommodate busy schedules. ""Volunteering with the Scouts is a fantastic way to make a real difference in the lives of young people,"" said Hyde. ""It's an opportunity to inspire, support, and nurture the next generation of leaders."" With over 60,000 young people waiting to join the Scouts, the organization is urging adults to consider volunteering and help bridge the gap. By supporting the Scouts, adults can empower young people with essential life skills and foster a brighter future for the entire community.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Johnson and Corbyn poisonous, says Welsh Lib Dem MP","The toxic political atmosphere in Westminster is damaging democratic debate and deterring people from entering politics, a Welsh MP has said. Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds said the personal attacks and ""demonisation"" of political opponents by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had made it ""increasingly difficult"" to have constructive discussions about the issues facing the country. ""People are being put off from entering politics because they don't want to subject themselves to the level of abuse that is now commonplace,"" she said. ""This is a very worrying trend and it is something that we need to address urgently."" Dodds, who is the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the ""nastiness"" of the political debate was ""damaging our democracy"" and ""making it harder for people to make informed decisions about who to vote for"". ""We need to find a way to have more respectful and constructive debates about the issues that matter to people,"" she said. ""We need to find a way to disagree without being disagreeable."" Dodds' comments come after a series of bitter exchanges between Johnson and Corbyn in the House of Commons. In one memorable incident, Johnson accused Corbyn of being a ""chicken"" for refusing to call a general election. Corbyn retorted by calling Johnson a ""coward"" for hiding from scrutiny. The two leaders have also traded insults on social media, with Johnson calling Corbyn a ""Marxist"" and Corbyn calling Johnson a ""liar"". The Liberal Democrats have long called for a more civil and respectful tone in political debate. In 2017, the party launched a campaign called ""Stop the Smears"" which aimed to tackle the spread of misinformation and personal attacks in politics. Dodds said the campaign was ""more relevant than ever"" in the current political climate. ""We need to find a way to restore trust in our political system,"" she said.

Ai Weiwei show at Royal Academy to house heaviest sculpture,"Ai Weiwei's daring exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, has pushed the boundaries of sculpture by housing one of the heaviest ever created. Weighing an astonishing 15 tonnes, the monumental ""Snake Ceiling"" is a testament to the artist's relentless exploration of power, history, and social justice. Crafted from stainless steel, the serpentine structure hangs suspended from the ceiling, its coils slithering through the grand galleries like a celestial serpent. Its immense weight necessitates reinforced beams and bespoke engineering solutions, highlighting the awe-inspiring feat of architectural collaboration that brought it to life. Weiwei meticulously handcrafted the individual components of the snake, assembling them with exquisite precision. The result is a seamless, undulating form that defies gravity, inviting viewers to contemplate the interplay between the physical and the intangible. The snake has been a recurring motif in Weiwei's work, often symbolizing authority, repression, and the struggle for freedom. In ""Snake Ceiling,"" the artist draws parallels between the serpentine form and the sinuous trajectory of history, where progress is often accompanied by setbacks and resilience. The exhibition, titled ""History of Bombs,"" delves into the destructive power of warfare and the human cost of conflict. Weiwei's iconic ""Forever Bicycles"" installation, featuring thousands of recycled bicycles hanging from the ceiling, evokes the fragility of life and the collective spirit of resistance. Another highlight is ""Bang,"" a massive explosion depicted using 2000 porcelain tiles. The work epitomizes Weiwei's critique of the commodification of suffering and the tendency to distance ourselves from the horrors that unfold in distant lands. Through his bold and provocative sculptures, Weiwei challenges conventional notions of art and engages with pressing social and political issues. His work forces us to confront uncomfortable truths and question the intricate web of power structures that shape our world. The Royal Academy exhibition provides a unique opportunity to witness the transformative power of Ai Weiwei's art firsthand. His monumental ""Snake Ceiling"" is a breathtaking testament to the artist's ingenuity, technical prowess, and unwavering commitment to using art as a catalyst for change.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Brittan widow attacks Met over abuse claims handling,"A British widow has criticized the Metropolitan Police's handling of her husband's abuse claims, saying the force failed to investigate properly and protect him.

He had made a series of allegations of abuse against senior political and military figures, but these were later found to be false. His wife, Laura Beech, said she had repeatedly raised concerns about her husband's mental health with the police, but they had not taken her seriously. She said she had also been harassed and intimidated by police officers. ""I feel like I've been let down by the police,"" she said. ""They should have been protecting my husband, but they didn't. They treated him like a criminal, and they treated me like a nuisance."" The Met has said it is ""deeply sorry"" for the way Mrs. Beech was treated. It said it has since changed its procedures for dealing with victims of abuse. However, Mrs. Beech said she does not believe that the Met has gone far enough.

London Stock Exchange resumes trading after glitch,"London Stock Exchange Resumes Trading After Glitch The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has resumed trading after a technical glitch forced it to suspend operations for several hours. The issue, which affected the exchange's trading platform, emerged shortly after the market opened on Tuesday morning. As a result, no trading could take place, causing significant disruption for investors and brokers. The LSE quickly responded to the situation, launching an investigation into the cause of the glitch. In the meantime, trading was suspended on both the main market and the AIM alternative investment market. The issue was eventually resolved, and trading resumed at 10:45 BST. The LSE said in a statement that it ""sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience caused to our members and other market participants."" The glitch is the latest in a series of technical issues that have plagued the LSE in recent years. In 2019, the exchange suffered a major outage that halted trading for more than six hours. The incident led to a sharp decline in the LSE's share price and raised questions about the resilience of its systems. The LSE has since invested heavily in upgrading its infrastructure and improving its resilience to technical glitches. However, the latest issue highlights the challenges that exchanges face in maintaining smooth and reliable operations in an increasingly complex and interconnected market environment. The suspension of trading on the LSE had a ripple effect across the global financial markets. Investors were left unable to trade UK stocks, while brokers faced difficulties executing orders. The incident also raised concerns about the vulnerability of financial exchanges to cyberattacks and other disruptions. The LSE is one of the world's largest stock exchanges, with a market capitalization of over £3 trillion. It is also a major hub for international finance, with many of the world's largest companies listed on its markets. The glitch is likely to raise questions about the LSE's ability to compete with other global exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Investors may be hesitant to trade on the LSE if they are concerned about the risk of future technical disruptions. The LSE is expected to release a full report on the causes of the glitch in due course. The exchange is also likely to face increased scrutiny from regulators and other stakeholders as it seeks to restore confidence in its operations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Ministers urged to ban 'reckless' evictions over rent arrears,"Ministers are being urged to introduce a ban on ""reckless"" evictions over rent arrears that have accrued during the Covid-19 pandemic. A cross-party group of MPs and peers is calling for the government to act now to prevent a wave of homelessness as the country emerges from lockdown. In a letter to Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, the group warns that many tenants have built up significant rent arrears due to job losses and reduced incomes during the pandemic. They say that without government intervention, these tenants could face eviction from their homes, even if they are making efforts to repay their debt. The letter is signed by Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, the Lib Dems' housing spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, and the Green Party's housing spokesperson, Caroline Lucas. It is also backed by a number of Conservative MPs, including Bob Blackman, Crispin Blunt, and Sir Peter Bottomley. The group says that the government must act now to prevent a ""public health disaster"" as well as a homelessness crisis. They are calling for a ban on evictions for rent arrears that have accrued during the pandemic, as well as financial support for tenants who are struggling to pay their rent. The government has already introduced a number of measures to help tenants during the pandemic, including a ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the end of March 2021 and a £435 million hardship fund for tenants who are struggling to pay their rent. However, the group of MPs and peers say that these measures do not go far enough and that more needs to be done to prevent a wave of homelessness.

Israel 'thwarts Hezbollah infiltration from Lebanon',"Israeli forces thwarted an attempted infiltration by Hezbollah militants from Lebanon into northern Israel on Saturday, the military said. The incident occurred near the town of Metula, where Israeli troops detected a group of armed men crossing the border fence. The troops opened fire, killing one of the militants and wounding another. The remaining militants fled back into Lebanon. The Israeli military said that the militants were carrying weapons and explosives, and that they were likely planning to carry out an attack in Israel.

The attempted infiltration comes at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon. In recent months, there have been several incidents of cross-border fire between the two countries. The Israeli military has been on high alert since the beginning of the year, after a series of rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon. The Israeli military has responded to these attacks by carrying out airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.

The Commission said that the tax arrangement between Apple and Ireland gave the company an unfair advantage over its competitors. Apple has appealed the ruling, arguing that it did not receive any special treatment from the Irish government and that the tax arrangement was in line with Irish law. The Irish government has also appealed the ruling, arguing that it did not give Apple any special treatment and that the tax arrangement was not illegal. The ECJ hearing is expected to last two days. A ruling is not expected for several months. If the ECJ upholds the Commission's ruling, it will be a major blow to Apple. The company could be forced to pay the €13 billion in back taxes, plus interest. It could also damage Apple's reputation and make it more difficult for the company to do business in Europe. If the ECJ overturns the Commission's ruling, it will be a victory for Apple and the Irish government. It will also set a precedent for other cases involving state aid and taxation. The Apple case is one of several high-profile cases that the European Commission has brought against multinational companies in recent years. The Commission has accused companies such as Amazon, Google, and Starbucks of receiving illegal state aid. The Commission's crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies has been welcomed by some, who argue that it is unfair for companies to pay less tax than other businesses. However, others have criticized the Commission's approach, arguing that it is damaging the competitiveness of European companies. The outcome of the Apple case will be closely watched by companies, governments, and tax experts around the world. It could have a significant impact on the way that multinational companies are taxed in Europe.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Greater Manchester PC Nicola Hughes' cortege met by applause,"Greater Manchester PC Nicola Hughes' cortege met by applause Mourners have lined the streets to pay their respects to Police Constable Nicola Hughes, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack last week. The cortege left Manchester Royal Infirmary at 10:30 BST on Wednesday and travelled to Manchester Cathedral, where a funeral service was held. Members of the public stood in silence as the hearse passed by, some wiping away tears. Others applauded as the coffin, draped in a Union flag, entered the cathedral. PC Hughes, 23, was shot dead in a gun and grenade attack in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, on Friday. She was responding to reports of a burglary when she and a colleague, PC Fiona Bone, were attacked. PC Bone, 32, was also killed in the attack. The cortege was led by a mounted police escort, followed by officers from Greater Manchester Police, other police forces and the emergency services. The hearse was followed by PC Hughes' family and friends, including her parents, Malcolm and Susan Hughes. The service at Manchester Cathedral was attended by around 1,000 people, including the Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the Home Secretary, Theresa May. The service was led by the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend David Walker. In his sermon, Bishop Walker said that PC Hughes was a ""heroine"" who had ""died in the line of duty"". He said: ""She was a young woman who had her whole life ahead of her. She had only been a police officer for two years, but she had already made a difference."" Bishop Walker said that PC Hughes' death was a ""tragedy"" but that she would ""never be forgotten"". He said: ""She will always be remembered as a brave and selfless police officer who gave her life to protect others."" At the end of the service, the congregation sang the hymn ""The Lord's My Shepherd"". The cortege then left the cathedral and travelled to Southern Cemetery, where PC Hughes was buried. The cemetery was packed with mourners, who stood in silence as the coffin was lowered into the grave. PC Hughes' family and friends then released white balloons into the sky. The balloons floated up into the air, carrying with them the love and respect of everyone who had gathered to say goodbye to a brave and selfless police officer.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Saga shares close flat on debut,"Saga shares close flat on debut Shares in Saga closed flat on their first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday. The over-50s specialist closed at 185 pence per share, the same price at which they were sold to investors in the company's initial public offering (IPO). The IPO raised £550m for Saga, which is using the money to reduce its debt and invest in its business. The company has been struggling in recent years, with profits falling and its share price tumbling. However, Saga's new management team, led by chief executive Euan Sutherland, is confident that the company can be turned around. Sutherland has a track record of success in the retail sector, having previously worked at Argos and Dixons Carphone. He has already made a number of changes at Saga, including simplifying the company's product range and improving its customer service. Sutherland is also investing in new technology, such as a new online platform that will make it easier for customers to buy Saga products and services. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about Saga's prospects. They believe that the company has a strong brand and a loyal customer base. However, they also warn that the company faces a number of challenges, including the rising cost of insurance and the increasing popularity of online travel agents. Saga's shares are likely to remain volatile in the short term. However, if Sutherland can successfully turn the company around, then the shares could have significant upside potential. In a statement, Sutherland said: ""I am delighted that Saga has successfully listed on the London Stock Exchange. This is a major milestone for the company and a testament to the hard work of our employees. ""We have a clear plan to turn Saga around and I am confident that we can create a successful future for the company and our shareholders.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Alex Salmond hails green energy work by Scots and Norwegians,"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has hailed the work of Scots and Norwegians in developing green energy. He was speaking at the opening of a new wind farm in Scotland, which is a joint venture between Scottish and Norwegian companies. The wind farm is part of a growing number of renewable energy projects in Scotland, which is aiming to become a world leader in the sector. Mr Salmond said that the work of Scots and Norwegians in developing green energy was ""a shining example"" of how international cooperation could help to tackle climate change. He said: ""This wind farm is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Scots and Norwegians. It is a symbol of our shared commitment to tackling climate change and building a cleaner, greener future for our planet."" The wind farm is located in the Highlands of Scotland, and will generate enough electricity to power 12,000 homes. It is the largest wind farm in Scotland, and one of the largest in the UK. The project was developed by ScottishPower Renewables and Statoil, and was built by a consortium of Scottish and Norwegian companies. Mr Salmond said that the wind farm was a ""major milestone"" in Scotland's transition to a low-carbon economy. He said: ""This wind farm is a major milestone in our journey to becoming a world leader in renewable energy. It is a symbol of our commitment to tackling climate change and building a cleaner, greener future for our planet."" The Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, also attended the opening of the wind farm. She said: ""This wind farm is a testament to the strong cooperation between Scotland and Norway.

Razzies: Christian comedy film gets top golden raspberry,"In a ceremony held to honor the worst of the worst in film, a Christian comedy has taken home the top prize. ""The Chosen"" won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture, as well as Worst Director for Dallas Jenkins, Worst Screenplay for Jenkins and Tyler Thompson, and Worst Supporting Actress for Lea Thompson. The film, which tells the story of Jesus Christ, has been criticized for its low production values, wooden acting, and heavy-handed religious message. Despite its critical panning, ""The Chosen"" has been a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The Razzies, which are awarded annually by the Golden Raspberry Foundation, have a long history of recognizing the worst films of the year. Past winners include such cinematic disasters as ""Showgirls,"" ""Battlefield Earth,"" and ""The Room."" ""The Chosen"" is the first Christian film to win the Razzie for Worst Picture. This has led to some controversy, with some critics accusing the Razzie voters of being biased against religious films. However, the Razzie Foundation has defended its decision, saying that ""The Chosen"" was simply the worst film of the year, regardless of its religious content. ""We don't care what your beliefs are,"" said Razzie founder John Wilson. ""If your movie sucks, we're going to give you a Razzie."" The Razzie Awards have always been a controversial event, but they have also become a cult favorite among film fans. Many people enjoy watching the ceremony to see which films will win and to revel in the sheer awfulness of some of the nominees. Whether you love them or hate them, the Razzies are a unique part of film culture. They remind us that even the worst films can have their own strange appeal.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
London tower block 'mouldy and damp' after cladding removed,"In a shocking exposé, residents of a London tower block have revealed the appalling living conditions they have been forced to endure after cladding was removed from their building. The 12-story block in Elephant and Castle has been plagued by mold, damp, and leaks since the cladding was removed as part of fire safety works following the Grenfell Tower disaster. Residents say they have been living in these conditions for months, with no end in sight. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: ""The mold is everywhere. It's on the walls, the ceilings, the furniture. It's making us all ill. We're constantly coughing and sneezing, and our eyes are always watering."" Another resident said: ""The damp is so bad that our clothes are always wet. We can't even dry them on the radiators because they're too cold. We're having to use dehumidifiers, but they're not making much difference."" The residents say they have complained to the building's management company, but they have been met with indifference. ""They just don't care,"" said one resident. ""They keep telling us that they're working on it, but nothing ever happens. We're at our wits' end."" The conditions in the tower block are a stark reminder of the Grenfell Tower disaster, in which 72 people died. The fire was caused by flammable cladding that was installed on the building. Following the Grenfell Tower fire, the government ordered that all tower blocks over 18 meters tall must have their cladding removed. However, the removal of the cladding has left many buildings exposed to the elements, leading to widespread problems with mold and damp. The residents of the tower block in Elephant and Castle are calling on the government to take action to address the issue of mold and damp in tower blocks. They say that they are living in inhumane conditions and that their health is being put at risk. A spokesperson for the building's management company said: ""We are aware of the issues that residents have been experiencing with mold and damp. We are working to address these issues as quickly as possible."" The spokesperson added that the company is carrying out a survey of all the flats in the tower block to assess the extent of the problem. The company is also working with a contractor to carry out repairs.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US finds against Bombardier in Boeing dispute,"US Finds Against Bombardier in Boeing Dispute The United States has ruled against Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier in a long-running trade dispute with Boeing. The dispute centered around allegations from Boeing that Bombardier had received illegal subsidies from the Canadian government, giving it an unfair advantage in the market. The US Department of Commerce has imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties of nearly 220% on Bombardier's C Series aircraft, which is designed to compete with Boeing's 737 MAX jetliner. The department also found that Bombardier had received unfair pricing benefits from the Canadian government, resulting in dumping margins of 79.41%. The decision is a major blow to Bombardier, which has been struggling financially for several years. The company has already announced plans to scale back production of the C Series and has been seeking partnerships with other companies to help fund its operations. The Canadian government has condemned the US decision, calling it ""unjustified"" and ""protectionist."" The government has vowed to continue defending Bombardier and the Canadian aerospace industry. Boeing has welcomed the decision, saying it ""reaffirms"" the company's position that Bombardier has been unfairly subsidized. Boeing has also said it is ""disappointed"" that Bombardier has not been held accountable for its actions. The US decision is likely to have a significant impact on the global aircraft industry. Bombardier is one of the world's largest producers of commercial aircraft, and its C Series is considered to be one of the most advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft in its class. The US decision could make it more difficult for Bombardier to compete with Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers. It could also lead to higher prices for C Series aircraft, making it less competitive in the market. The dispute between Boeing and Bombardier has been going on for several years. In 2017, Boeing filed a petition with the US government, alleging that Bombardier had received illegal subsidies from the Canadian government. The US government launched an investigation, which resulted in the preliminary anti-subsidy duties announced this week. The dispute has also been taken to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is currently reviewing the case, and a decision is expected later this year. The outcome of the WTO case could have a significant impact on the US-Canada trade relationship. If the WTO finds that the US has violated trade rules, it could lead to retaliatory tariffs from Canada. The US-Canada trade relationship is already strained due to the ongoing dispute over tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Bombardier dispute could further damage the relationship between the two countries.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The review was commissioned by NHS England and NHS Improvement after the deaths of 29 patients at the trust between 2004 and 2015. It found that the trust ""failed to take comprehensive action"" on a number of recommendations made by the Healthcare Commission in 2006, the Care Quality Commission in 2012, and the Independent Reconfiguration Panel in 2013. The review also found that the trust had a ""failure to engage with families"" of patients who died, and that it had ""not always been transparent"" about its actions.

""We have already begun work on a number of areas, including improving our governance, engagement with families, and transparency."" The review found that the trust had failed to act on recommendations in a number of areas, including: Governance: The trust's governance was ""not robust enough"" and there was a ""lack of clarity"" about roles and responsibilities. Engagement with families: The trust had ""not always engaged effectively"" with families of patients who died, and had ""not always been transparent"" about its actions. Quality of care: The trust had ""not always provided a good quality of care"" and there were ""concerns about the safety of services"".

Tory MSPs urge UK government to let asylum seekers work,"Tory MSPs urge UK government to let asylum seekers work Scottish Conservative MSPs have called on the UK government to allow asylum seekers to work in the UK while their claims are being processed. The move would help to reduce the financial burden on the taxpayer and allow asylum seekers to contribute to the economy, they said. The Scottish government has already indicated that it supports the change, but the UK government has so far resisted. Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman, said: ""The UK government's current policy is unfair and unsustainable. ""Asylum seekers are often left in limbo for months or even years, unable to work or support themselves. This is a waste of their skills and a drain on the taxpayer. ""Allowing asylum seekers to work would allow them to contribute to the economy and support themselves and their families."" The Scottish government has estimated that allowing asylum seekers to work could save the taxpayer up to £100 million a year. The UK government has said that it is considering the issue, but has not yet made a decision. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that asylum seekers are supported while their claims are being processed. ""We are considering a range of options to improve the asylum system, including allowing asylum seekers to work in certain circumstances."" The Scottish Conservatives' call has been backed by a number of charities and organisations, including the Scottish Refugee Council. Sarah Boyack, the Scottish Refugee Council's policy and advocacy manager, said: ""The UK government's current policy is inhumane and unjust. ""Asylum seekers are often highly skilled and motivated individuals who want to work and contribute to society. Denying them the opportunity to do so is a waste of their potential and a false economy."" The UK government has been under increasing pressure to change its policy on asylum seekers. In recent months, there have been a number of high-profile cases of asylum seekers being detained and deported, even though they have not committed any crime. The government has defended its policy, saying that it is necessary to deter people from making frivolous asylum claims. However, critics argue that the policy is cruel and inhumane. The Scottish Conservatives' call to allow asylum seekers to work is a welcome step forward. It would help to reduce the financial burden on the taxpayer, allow asylum seekers to contribute to the economy, and improve their mental and physical health.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Domestic abuse law: 'No excuse' for Northern Ireland delays,"Domestic abuse law: 'No excuse' for Northern Ireland delays Campaigners have condemned the ""inexcusable"" delay in implementing new domestic abuse laws in Northern Ireland. The Domestic Abuse and Family Proceedings (Northern Ireland) Act was passed in March 2021, but key provisions have yet to be implemented. These include a ban on cross-examination of victims by their abusers in family courts, and a new offence of non-fatal strangulation. Women's Aid NI has said the delay is ""putting lives at risk"". ""We have been clear from the outset that every day this legislation remains unimplemented is a day that women and children in Northern Ireland are denied the protections they need,"" said Grainne Teggart, the charity's head of policy and public affairs. ""Domestic abuse is a life-threatening crime. There is no excuse for further delay."" The new law would also introduce a presumption against granting bail to domestic abuse suspects, and would make it easier for victims to get protection orders. Justice Minister Naomi Long has said that she is ""committed"" to implementing the legislation as soon as possible. However, she has also said that there are a number of ""complex"" issues that need to be resolved before it can be implemented. These include the need to train police officers and other frontline staff on the new law, and to develop new IT systems. Ms Long has said that she is working with other government departments to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. However, campaigners say that the delay is unacceptable. ""There is no excuse for this delay,"" said Claire Hanna, an SDLP MLA. ""Women and children in Northern Ireland are being let down by the government.""

France to ban culling of unwanted male chicks by end of 2021,"France to ban culling of unwanted male chicks by end of 2021 France is set to become the first country in the world to ban the culling of unwanted male chicks by the end of 2021. The practice, known as chick culling, involves the killing of millions of male chicks each year because they are not suitable for egg production. Male chicks are typically killed shortly after they are born, either by being gassed or macerated. The French ban is part of a wider effort to improve animal welfare in the country. In recent years, France has also banned the use of cages for laying hens and the force-feeding of ducks and geese for foie gras production. The decision to ban chick culling has been welcomed by animal welfare groups. ""This is a major victory for animal welfare,"" said Claire Bass, head of public affairs at the RSPCA. ""Chick culling is a cruel and unnecessary practice that has no place in a modern society."" The ban is also supported by the French government, which has committed to improving animal welfare in the country. ""Chick culling is a barbaric practice that has no place in France,"" said Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie. ""We are committed to banning this practice and ensuring that all animals are treated with respect."" The ban on chick culling is expected to come into effect by the end of 2021. However, there are concerns that the ban could lead to an increase in the number of male chicks being reared for meat. ""We need to make sure that there is a market for these male chicks,"" said Bass. ""Otherwise, they will simply be killed in a different way."" The French government has said that it is working with the poultry industry to develop alternatives to chick culling. These alternatives could include the use of sexed eggs, which are eggs that can be identified as male or female before they are hatched. The ban on chick culling is a significant step forward for animal welfare in France. It is hoped that other countries will follow France's lead and ban this cruel and unnecessary practice.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

'Potent' psychoactive drugs on the rise in Wales,"'Potent' psychoactive drugs on the rise in Wales New psychoactive substances (NPS), often referred to as 'legal highs', are becoming increasingly prevalent in Wales, with a rise in deaths and hospitalizations attributed to their use. These substances, which mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis, are often sold as research chemicals or plant food due to loopholes in the law. However, their potency and unpredictable effects pose significant risks to users. In Wales, there has been a surge in the number of deaths linked to NPS. In 2021, there were 28 deaths involving NPS, the highest number on record. The majority of these deaths were among young people aged 16-24. Hospital admissions related to NPS have also increased, particularly for mental health issues such as psychosis and anxiety. Some users have experienced permanent damage to their physical and mental health. ""These substances are far from harmless,"" said Dr. Gareth Tucker, a consultant psychiatrist at the North Wales Specialist Substance Misuse Service. ""They can have devastating consequences, both in the short and long term."" NPS are often marketed as safe alternatives to illegal drugs, but this is misleading. They are not regulated or controlled, and their composition and effects can vary widely. Users may be unaware of the exact substances they are taking and the potential risks involved. ""We're seeing more and more young people experimenting with these drugs, believing they are a less harmful option,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cleland of the Welsh Regional Organised Crime Unit. ""But they are playing Russian roulette with their health."" The Welsh government is working with law enforcement and health services to tackle the issue. The Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 gives police the power to seize and destroy NPS, but it has been criticized for not going far enough. ""We need to do more to educate young people about the dangers of these substances and to support those who are struggling with addiction,"" said Health Minister Eluned Morgan. Experts are also calling for better regulation of NPS, similar to the approach taken with prescription drugs. This would ensure that substances are properly tested and labeled, and that users have access to accurate information about their potential risks and benefits. Until then, the rise in NPS use in Wales remains a serious public health concern. It is essential that young people are aware of the dangers and that support is available for those who need it.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Plastic bag use in Wales halves in four years,"Plastic bag use in Wales has halved in the past four years, according to the latest figures. The Welsh Government introduced a 5p charge on single-use carrier bags in October 2011, and the number of bags issued by large retailers has fallen by 58% since then. The charge was introduced as part of a wider effort to reduce the amount of plastic waste produced in Wales. Plastic bags are a major source of litter, and they can take hundreds of years to decompose. The Welsh Government says the charge has been a success, and it has helped to change people's behavior. ""The 5p charge has been a huge success,"" said Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn. ""It has helped to raise awareness of the environmental impact of plastic bags, and it has encouraged people to change their behavior. ""We are now seeing a significant reduction in the number of plastic bags being used in Wales, and this is having a positive impact on our environment."" The charge has been welcomed by environmental groups. Friends of the Earth Cymru said it was a ""landmark victory"" in the fight against plastic pollution. ""This charge has shown that it is possible to change people's behavior and reduce the amount of plastic waste we produce,"" said a spokesman for the group. ""We hope that other countries will follow Wales' lead and introduce similar charges."" The charge has also been credited with helping to raise money for good causes. The Welsh Government has donated £6.5 million from the proceeds of the charge to environmental projects. The charge has not been without its critics. Some businesses have argued that it is a burden on consumers, and that it does not do enough to reduce the amount of plastic waste produced. However, the Welsh Government says that the charge has been a success, and it has no plans to scrap it. ""The 5p charge is here to stay,"" said Ms. Blythyn.

Belfast Royal Academy changes admissions criteria,"Belfast Royal Academy Changes Admissions Criteria Belfast Royal Academy (BRA), one of Northern Ireland's leading grammar schools, has announced significant changes to its admissions criteria. The move aims to address concerns about social inequality and to broaden access to the school for pupils from all backgrounds. Under the new criteria, BRA will consider a wider range of factors in its admissions process, including: Key Stage 2 results: Pupils will still be required to take an entrance exam, but their performance in Key Stage 2 assessments will also be taken into account. Parental income: The school will consider the economic circumstances of families, with pupils from low-income households receiving additional support and priority in the admissions process. Geographic location: BRA will aim to ensure that pupils from all areas of Belfast have equal access to the school, regardless of their postcode. Diversity: The school will actively seek to promote diversity within its student body, actively encouraging applications from pupils from all ethnic backgrounds, religions, and socioeconomic groups. The changes were developed following a comprehensive review of the school's admissions process. The review found that the previous criteria, which focused heavily on entrance exam results, disproportionately favoured pupils from affluent backgrounds. ""We believe that it is our responsibility as a school to provide opportunities for all pupils, regardless of their circumstances,"" said BRA Principal Suzanne McCullagh. ""These changes will help us to create a more inclusive and representative student body, which will benefit all of our pupils."" The changes have been welcomed by education stakeholders. The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma, said: ""This is a positive step towards ensuring that all children in Northern Ireland have access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background."" The changes will come into effect for the 2024/25 academic year. BRA will be working with primary schools and the wider community to raise awareness of the new criteria and to provide support to pupils who are interested in applying. The school hopes that the changes will help to break down barriers to entry and create a more diverse and vibrant learning environment for all its students.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Do Amish hold clue to preventing asthma in children?,"Do Amish hold clue to preventing asthma in children? Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects millions of children worldwide. It is characterized by episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Although there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help to control the symptoms. One of the most promising new treatments for asthma is based on the observation that Amish children have a much lower rate of asthma than children from other populations. Amish children are raised in a traditional farming community, and they have a very different lifestyle than children from urban areas. They eat a diet that is high in fiber and low in processed foods, they get plenty of exercise, and they are exposed to a variety of microbes. Researchers believe that these factors may help to protect Amish children from asthma. Studies have shown that children who grow up in farming communities have a lower risk of asthma than children who grow up in urban areas. This is likely due to the fact that farming communities have higher levels of exposure to microbes, which can help to train the immune system to fight off allergies and asthma. Other studies have shown that children who eat a diet that is high in fiber and low in processed foods have a lower risk of asthma. Fiber helps to keep the digestive system healthy, and it can also help to reduce inflammation. Processed foods, on the other hand, can contain a number of harmful ingredients, such as artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and dyes, which can trigger asthma symptoms. Finally, studies have shown that children who get plenty of exercise have a lower risk of asthma. Exercise helps to strengthen the lungs and heart, and it can also help to reduce stress. Stress can trigger asthma symptoms, so it is important to find ways to manage stress. The findings from these studies suggest that there may be a number of things that parents can do to help prevent asthma in their children. These include: Eating a diet that is high in fiber and low in processed foods. Getting plenty of exercise. Exposing children to a variety of microbes. Of course, there is no guarantee that these measures will prevent asthma, but they may help to reduce the risk. If your child has asthma, it is important to work with a doctor to develop a treatment plan that is right for them.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Primark fire: Council to approve building application,"Primark fire: Council to approve building application Leicester City Council is set to approve a building application for a new Primark store on the site of the former fire-damaged building. The application, which was submitted by Primark in May 2023, proposes a new five-storey building with a total floorspace of 10,000 square metres. The new store would replace the existing Primark store, which was destroyed in a fire in September 2022. The council's planning committee is due to meet on 21st February 2024 to consider the application. A report to the committee recommends that the application be approved, subject to a number of conditions. These conditions include: The new building must be designed to meet the highest standards of fire safety. The new building must be accessible to people with disabilities. The new building must be energy-efficient. The report also notes that the new Primark store would create around 500 new jobs. The fire at the old Primark store caused extensive damage to the building and its contents. The store was closed for several months while repairs were carried out. The new Primark store will be located on the same site as the old store, on Gallowtree Gate in Leicester city centre. The new store is expected to open in 2025. The approval of the building application is a significant step forward in the redevelopment of the site of the former fire-damaged building.

Dale Farm travellers camp eviction notices served,"Dale Farm Travellers Camp Eviction Notices Served Residents of Dale Farm, the UK's largest illegal travellers camp, have been served eviction notices as authorities prepare to clear the site. The notices, served by Basildon Council, give residents until September 19 to leave the camp in Essex. After this date, bailiffs will be instructed to enforce the eviction. Dale Farm has been a source of controversy for years, with local residents complaining about noise, pollution, and traffic. The travellers, on the other hand, claim they have been unfairly targeted and that they have nowhere else to go. The council has been working to relocate the travellers for several years, but no suitable alternative site has yet been found. The travellers have rejected the council's offer of temporary accommodation, claiming it is inadequate. The eviction process is expected to be lengthy and costly, with estimates ranging from £3 million to £18 million. The council has said it is committed to a ""peaceful and orderly"" eviction, but has warned that it will use force if necessary. The travellers have vowed to resist the eviction and have said they will not leave their homes without a fight. They have also accused the council of racism and discrimination. The eviction of Dale Farm has divided public opinion. Some people support the council's decision, arguing that the travellers have broken the law by setting up an illegal camp. Others sympathize with the travellers, saying that they have been marginalized and denied their basic rights. The eviction is likely to have a significant impact on the travellers. Many of them have lived at Dale Farm for generations and have built their homes and businesses there. They will now be forced to leave their homes and find new places to live. The eviction is also likely to have a wider impact on the UK. It has raised questions about the rights of travellers and the government's responsibility to provide them with adequate accommodation. The eviction of Dale Farm is a complex and sensitive issue. There are no easy answers and it is likely to continue to divide public opinion for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
#MeToo in South Korea: Governor resigns after rape allegations,"#MeToo in South Korea: Governor resigns after rape allegations Ansan Mayor Son Kum-ju has resigned following allegations of rape made by a former aide. The move comes amid a growing #MeToo movement in South Korea, where women are increasingly speaking out against sexual violence and harassment. Son, a member of the ruling Democratic Party, has denied the allegations. He said he would step down to ""take responsibility"" for the controversy and to ""minimize the damage"" to his party. The allegations against Son were first made public in a Facebook post by a woman who identified herself as his former aide. The woman, who has not been named, said that Son had raped her on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2018. She said that she had been afraid to come forward sooner because of Son's powerful position. However, she said that she had been inspired by the #MeToo movement to speak out. The allegations against Son have sparked outrage in South Korea. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand his resignation and to call for an end to sexual violence. The #MeToo movement has gained significant momentum in South Korea in recent months. A number of high-profile men have been accused of sexual misconduct, including former Justice Minister Cho Kuk and former Busan Mayor Oh Keo-don. The movement has led to a number of changes in South Korean society. The government has introduced new laws to combat sexual violence, and companies are taking steps to prevent and respond to sexual harassment. However, there is still much work to be done. Sexual violence remains a serious problem in South Korea, and many women are still afraid to come forward and report their experiences. The resignation of Ansan Mayor Son Kum-ju is a significant step forward in the fight against sexual violence in South Korea. It shows that women are no longer willing to tolerate abuse, and that those in power will be held accountable for their actions.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Student exchanges in no-deal Brexit threat,"Student exchanges in no-deal Brexit threat A no-deal Brexit could put thousands of British students at risk of losing out on Erasmus+ funding, which allows them to study or work in other European countries. The government has pledged to underwrite the funding for students who start their studies in the 2019/20 academic year, but it is unclear what will happen to students who start their studies in subsequent years. The Erasmus+ programme is a key part of the UK's education system, and it provides students with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and gain valuable experience of living and studying in a different country. The loss of Erasmus+ funding would be a major blow to British students, and it would also damage the UK's reputation as a world-leading education destination. The government has said that it is committed to finding a way to continue funding Erasmus+, but it is unclear how it will do this if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. One option would be to create a new UK-wide scheme that would replace Erasmus+. However, this would likely be more expensive than Erasmus+ and it would not provide students with the same opportunities to study in other European countries. Another option would be for the UK to seek to negotiate a bilateral agreement with the EU that would allow British students to continue to participate in Erasmus+. However, this would require the EU's agreement and it is not clear whether the EU would be willing to do this. The government has said that it is exploring all options to ensure that British students can continue to benefit from Erasmus+. However, it is clear that a no-deal Brexit would pose a significant threat to the future of Erasmus+ in the UK. Reaction from students The news that Erasmus+ could be lost in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been met with dismay by students. A petition calling on the government to protect Erasmus+ has attracted over 100,000 signatures. Students have also been taking to social media to express their concerns. One student tweeted: ""Erasmus+ is an incredible opportunity for students to broaden their horizons and gain valuable experience. It would be a tragedy if it were lost."" Another student said: ""I'm planning to study abroad next year and I'm really worried about what will happen to Erasmus+ if we leave the EU without a deal."" Government response The government has said that it is committed to finding a way to continue funding Erasmus+. However, it is unclear how it will do this if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has said that he is ""determined"" to ensure that British students can continue to benefit from Erasmus+. However, he has also said that the government is ""prepared to put in place alternative arrangements"" if necessary. It is clear that the government is facing a difficult challenge in trying to find a way to continue funding Erasmus+ in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, it is important to remember that Erasmus+ is a key part of the UK's education system, and it would be a major blow to British students if it were lost.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Lebanon forms new government after long delay,"Lebanon Forms New Government After Lengthy Deadlock After months of political wrangling, Lebanon has finally formed a new government, ending a protracted period of political uncertainty. The new government, led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati, is tasked with addressing the country's pressing economic and political challenges. The formation of the government comes after a nine-month impasse, the result of deep-seated political divisions and external interference. The outgoing government, headed by Hassan Diab, resigned in August 2020 following the deadly Beirut port explosion, which killed over 200 people and caused widespread devastation. The new government includes representatives from Lebanon's various political factions, including Hezbollah, the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, and the Sunni Future Movement. The cabinet's composition reflects the complexity of Lebanon's political landscape and the need for consensus among different groups. Prime Minister Mikati, a billionaire businessman, has pledged to prioritize economic recovery and reforms. Lebanon is grappling with a severe economic crisis, with the currency losing over 90% of its value and inflation soaring. The country is also facing a severe fuel shortage and widespread power cuts. Mikati's government has outlined a series of measures to tackle the crisis, including seeking international financial assistance and implementing structural reforms. The government has also pledged to address corruption and improve transparency. However, the challenges facing the new government are immense. Lebanon's economy is deeply in debt, and the political system is plagued by sectarianism and corruption. The government will need to implement difficult reforms while navigating a volatile political landscape. The formation of a new government is a positive step for Lebanon, but it remains to be seen whether it can effectively address the country's multiple challenges. The government will need to prioritize economic recovery, implement structural reforms, and combat corruption to secure a stable and prosperous future for Lebanon.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'Blindness and mental health can come hand in hand',"Blindness and Mental Health: The Interplay Blindness, a profound sensory loss, not only affects physical well-being but also carries significant mental health implications. Studies have established a strong correlation between blindness and mental health disorders. Increased Risk of Depression One of the most common mental health challenges faced by blind individuals is depression. The loss of sight, coupled with the challenges of navigating a world designed for the sighted, can lead to feelings of isolation, loss of purpose, and an overall diminished quality of life. Blindness can also result in a reduction of social interactions and activities, further contributing to depression. Anxiety and Adjustment Disorders Anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety related to specific situations, are also prevalent among blind individuals. The uncertainty and fear of navigating unfamiliar environments, coupled with the stigma and discrimination they may experience, can trigger anxiety. Adjustment disorders, which involve difficulties adapting to significant life changes, are also common in the aftermath of vision loss. Sleep Disturbances Blindness can disrupt sleep patterns due to the absence of visual cues that regulate the circadian rhythm. This can lead to insomnia, fragmented sleep, and daytime drowsiness, which can further exacerbate mental health symptoms. Strategies for Coping Addressing the mental health needs of blind individuals requires a multifaceted approach. Counseling and psychotherapy can help navigate the emotional challenges associated with vision loss and develop coping mechanisms. Support groups and peer support networks provide a sense of community and reduce isolation. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) CBT has been found to be effective in reducing depression and anxiety in blind individuals. It focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mental distress. Assistive Technology Assistive technology, such as screen readers and optical character recognition software, can empower blind individuals and increase their independence. This can help improve self-esteem, reduce anxiety about navigating, and increase participation in social activities. Lifestyle Modifications Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can promote overall well-being and mitigate mental health symptoms. Conclusion Blindness and mental health are inextricably linked. It is essential to recognize the increased risk of mental health disorders among blind individuals and provide them with appropriate support and interventions. By addressing both the physical and mental aspects of blindness, we can improve the quality of life and overall well-being of this population.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Paris attacks: Salah Abdeslam stays silent in French court,"Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect in the 2015 Paris attacks, has refused to answer questions in a French court as his trial resumed on Monday. Abdeslam, a 32-year-old French citizen of Moroccan descent, is accused of playing a key role in the coordinated terror attacks that killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more across the French capital on November 13, 2015. He was arrested in Brussels in March 2016 and extradited to France two years later. He has since been held in solitary confinement in a high-security prison near Paris. At the start of his trial on Monday, Abdeslam refused to stand up when asked to do so by the presiding judge. He also declined to give his name or answer any questions about his personal or criminal history. ""I will not speak,"" Abdeslam said calmly, staring straight ahead at the judge. ""I do not recognize the legitimacy of this court."" Abdeslam's lawyer, Olivia Ronen, said her client was exercising his right to remain silent. She said he was ""traumatized"" by his time in prison and was not fit to stand trial. ""He has been subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment,"" Ronen said. ""He is not in a state to defend himself."" The prosecution, however, argued that Abdeslam was simply trying to delay the trial and avoid taking responsibility for his actions. ""He is a terrorist who has killed innocent people,"" said prosecutor Jean-Michel Hayat. ""He must be held accountable for his crimes."" The trial is expected to last several months and will hear evidence from hundreds of witnesses. It is one of the most high-profile terrorism trials in French history. The attacks on November 13, 2015, were claimed by the Islamic State group. The attacks began with a series of coordinated bombings outside the Stade de France national stadium, where a friendly football match between France and Germany was taking place. The attackers then moved on to the Bataclan concert hall, where they killed 90 people. They also attacked several restaurants and cafes in the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris. The attacks were the deadliest in France since World War II and shocked the nation. They also led to increased security measures across the country. Abdeslam is the only survivor of the group of attackers. He was arrested in the Molenbeek district of Brussels in March 2016, along with several other suspects. He was extradited to France in April 2018 and has been held in solitary confinement ever since. He has refused to cooperate with the investigation and has not spoken to police or investigators. The trial is expected to shed light on the planning and execution of the attacks, as well as Abdeslam's role in them. It is also expected to be a test of the French justice system's ability to deal with such high-profile cases.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'Serious failings' in Glan Clwyd Hospital care of patient who died,"Serious Failings' in Glan Clwyd Hospital Care of Patient Who Died An investigation has found ""serious failings"" in the care of a patient who died at Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales. The patient, 67-year-old David Roberts, was admitted to the hospital in December 2020 with sepsis and pneumonia. He died in January 2021. An independent investigation by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board found that there were delays in Mr. Roberts' diagnosis and treatment, and that staff failed to follow proper procedures. The report found that: Mr. Roberts was not given antibiotics for sepsis until 24 hours after he was admitted to the hospital. He was not given a CT scan to diagnose his pneumonia until 48 hours after he was admitted. Staff did not follow proper infection control procedures, which may have contributed to Mr. Roberts' infection. The report concluded that these failings ""led to a delay in Mr. Roberts' diagnosis and treatment, which contributed to his death."" The health board has apologized to Mr. Roberts' family and has said that it is taking steps to address the failings identified in the report. These steps include: Reviewing and updating infection control procedures Improving communication between staff Providing additional training for staff The health board has also said that it will be working with other organizations to ensure that the lessons learned from this case are shared across the NHS. Mr. Roberts' family has said that they are ""devastated"" by his death and that they hope that the changes being made by the health board will prevent other families from suffering the same tragedy. The investigation into Mr. Roberts' death is the latest in a series of recent incidents involving serious failings in the care of patients at Glan Clwyd Hospital. In 2020, an independent review found that there were ""significant concerns"" about the quality of care at the hospital and that there was a ""culture of defensiveness"" among staff.

Everest: Indian police couple's summit claim investigated,"Indian police couple's Everest summit claim investigated A police couple from India are being investigated after claiming to have climbed Mount Everest, but inconsistencies in their evidence have raised doubts over their achievement. Satyarup Siddhanta and his wife Purnima were hailed as national heroes after announcing in May that they had reached the summit of the world's highest mountain. But an investigation by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) has found that the couple's GPS data does not match their claimed route, and that they did not take any photographs of themselves at the summit. The IMF has also questioned the couple's claim that they reached the summit without using supplemental oxygen, which is required by most climbers to reach the summit of Everest due to the extreme altitude. Siddhanta and Purnima have denied any wrongdoing, and have accused the IMF of being biased against them because they are not professional mountaineers. The couple's claim to have climbed Everest has been met with scepticism from many in the mountaineering community. Everest is one of the most dangerous mountains to climb, and the death zone above 8,000 metres is known as the ""death zone"" due to the lack of oxygen. In 2019, 11 climbers died on Everest, and there have been over 300 deaths on the mountain since the first successful ascent in 1953. The IMF's investigation is ongoing, and it is not yet clear whether Siddhanta and Purnima will be stripped of their title as the first Indian couple to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen. If the couple are found to have fabricated their claim, it would be a major blow to their reputation and to the reputation of Indian mountaineering. It would also raise questions about the validity of other claims to have climbed Everest, and could lead to stricter regulations on climbing the mountain.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The country's health ministry said on Thursday that 9,843 new cases had been confirmed, taking the total number of infections to 476,388. The previous daily record was set on 14 September, when 9,799 new cases were reported. The sharp rise in cases comes as France prepares to ease lockdown measures from Saturday. Prime Minister Jean Castex announced on Wednesday that the government would lift the requirement for people to stay within 1km of their homes and would allow shops and businesses to reopen. However, the government has warned that the easing of restrictions could lead to a further increase in cases. What is the situation in France? France has been one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe by the coronavirus pandemic. The country has recorded more than 476,000 cases and over 31,000 deaths. The government imposed a strict lockdown in March in an attempt to contain the virus, but the number of cases has started to rise again in recent weeks. What are the measures being taken? The French government has announced a number of measures to try to control the spread of the virus, including: Requiring people to wear masks in public places Limiting the number of people who can gather in one place Closing bars and restaurants Imposing a curfew from 9pm to 6am The government has also launched a mass testing programme in an attempt to identify and isolate cases of the virus. What are the experts saying? Experts have warned that the easing of lockdown measures could lead to a further increase in cases. Dr Catherine Hill, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, said: ""The French government is taking a big risk by easing lockdown measures at this time."" ""The number of cases is still rising and there is a real risk that the virus could spread even faster once people are allowed to move around more freely."" Dr Antoine Flahault, an epidemiologist at the University of Geneva, said: ""The French government needs to be very careful about how it eases lockdown measures."" ""They need to make sure that the measures are phased in gradually and that they are closely monitored.""

BP selling part of Magnus field and Sullom Voe stakes to EnQuest,"BP Sells Part of Magnus Field and Sullom Voe Stakes to EnQuest Energy giant BP has agreed to sell a portion of its stake in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe oil terminal to EnQuest, an independent oil and gas producer. The deal, worth £375 million ($500 million), is part of BP's strategy to streamline its portfolio and focus on its core assets. BP will sell its entire 25% stake in the Magnus field, located 140 miles northeast of the Shetland Islands, to EnQuest. The Magnus field, which began production in 1983, has an estimated 100 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil reserves. EnQuest will also acquire BP's 32.4% stake in the Sullom Voe Terminal, which is responsible for processing and exporting oil from the Magnus field and other North Sea assets. The sale of the Magnus field and Sullom Voe stakes is the latest in a series of divestments by BP as it seeks to reduce its debt and invest in new energy projects. The company has recently sold assets in Oman, Egypt, and Trinidad and Tobago, and is planning to sell more non-core assets in the future. EnQuest, which is headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland, has been actively acquiring assets in the North Sea in recent years. The company believes that the Magnus field and Sullom Voe Terminal are valuable assets that will help it grow its production and cash flow. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023, subject to regulatory approval. Once the transaction is complete, EnQuest will become the majority owner of the Magnus field and the Sullom Voe Terminal. BP's decision to sell its Magnus field and Sullom Voe stakes is a reflection of the changing landscape of the North Sea oil and gas industry. The industry is facing challenges from the energy transition and rising production costs, and companies are increasingly looking to sell non-core assets to focus on more profitable projects. EnQuest's acquisition of the Magnus field and Sullom Voe stakes is a sign of its confidence in the future of the North Sea oil and gas industry. The company believes that the assets have significant potential and will help it to grow its business in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry: Pupils 'robbed' of their childhoods,"Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry: Victims Robbed of Their Childhoods A damning inquiry into decades of child abuse in Scottish schools has concluded that pupils were ""robbed"" of their childhoods by a culture of systemic failures. The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) report, published today, found that thousands of children suffered physical, emotional, and sexual abuse at the hands of teachers, staff, and other pupils. The abuse took place in a wide range of educational settings, including primary and secondary schools, boarding schools, and special schools. The inquiry heard harrowing testimony from victims who described being subjected to horrific abuse, including beatings, humiliation, and sexual assault. Many victims said they had suffered lifelong psychological damage as a result of the abuse. The report found that the abuse was often ""covered up"" by school authorities, who failed to take action to protect children. In some cases, the abusers were even promoted to positions of responsibility. The inquiry made a series of recommendations to prevent child abuse from happening again in Scottish schools. These included: Mandatory reporting of child abuse: All school staff should be legally required to report any suspected child abuse. Improved training for staff: All school staff should receive training on how to identify and respond to child abuse. Increased support for victims: Victims of child abuse should be provided with access to specialist support services. The Scottish Government has welcomed the inquiry's findings and has pledged to implement its recommendations in full. ""This is a dark day for Scotland,"" said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. ""We must never forget the children who suffered so much in our schools. We owe it to them to do everything in our power to ensure that such abuse never happens again."" The SCAI was established in 2015 to investigate allegations of child abuse in Scottish schools over a period of decades. The inquiry heard evidence from more than 500 witnesses and examined thousands of documents. The report is a watershed moment in the fight against child abuse in Scotland. It is hoped that its recommendations will help to create a safer environment for children in Scottish schools.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Loving v Virginia: Lawyer in famed interracial marriage case dies,"Loving v Virginia: Lawyer in Famed Interracial Marriage Case Dies Bernard Cohen, the New York City lawyer who successfully argued the landmark interracial marriage case Loving v Virginia before the US Supreme Court, has died at the age of 90. In 1958, Cohen took on the case of Richard and Mildred Loving, a mixed-race couple who were arrested and convicted in Virginia for violating the state's anti-miscegenation law. Cohen argued before the Supreme Court that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying citizens equal protection under the law. On June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the Lovings, declaring the Virginia law unconstitutional. The ruling was a major victory for civil rights and paved the way for the legalization of interracial marriage nationwide. Cohen's role in the Loving case was instrumental in overturning one of the last vestiges of racial segregation in the United States. He was recognized for his dedication to social justice and his unwavering commitment to fighting discrimination. After the Loving case, Cohen continued his work as a civil rights lawyer, representing clients in cases involving racial discrimination, employment discrimination, and police brutality. He also served as president of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Cohen's death is a loss to the legal community and to the cause of civil rights. His legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.

Johnson was initially charged with illegally killing a grizzly bear, a species protected under Canadian law. He was convicted in 2015, but appealed the conviction, arguing that he acted in self-defense and that the delay in reporting the incident was not unreasonable. The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Johnson's appeal, ruling that he had a duty to report the killing to authorities as soon as possible. The court found that Johnson's delay in reporting the incident was not justified and that he had not taken reasonable steps to avoid killing the bear. The ruling has been praised by wildlife advocates and law enforcement officials, who say it sends a clear message that people who kill protected animals in self-defense must report the incident to authorities promptly. However, some legal experts have criticized the ruling, arguing that it places an undue burden on people who kill animals in self-defense. They argue that requiring people to report such incidents immediately may deter them from defending themselves against dangerous animals. The Supreme Court's ruling is a significant development in Canadian law, and it is likely to have implications for future cases involving the killing of protected animals in self-defense. In the wake of the ruling, some provincial governments are considering changes to their wildlife laws to make it easier for people to report the killing of protected animals in self-defense. However, it is clear that the Supreme Court's ruling has set a high bar for such cases, and it is unlikely that people who kill protected animals in self-defense will be able to avoid prosecution in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Restrictions on ex-prisoner advisers may deny opportunities,"Restrictions on ex-prisoner advisers may deny opportunities Ex-prisoners who have turned their lives around are being denied the chance to help others because of overly restrictive rules, according to a new report. The report, by the Prison Reform Trust, found that ex-prisoners who want to become prison advisers are often barred from doing so because of their criminal records. This is despite the fact that they have a unique understanding of the prison system and the challenges faced by prisoners. The report calls for the government to review the current restrictions on ex-prisoner advisers. It argues that these restrictions are unfair and that they are preventing ex-prisoners from making a positive contribution to society. One of the ex-prisoners who has been affected by these restrictions is John. John was jailed for a non-violent drug offense and served two years in prison. After his release, he wanted to use his experience to help other prisoners. However, he was told that he could not become a prison adviser because of his criminal record. ""I was really disappointed,"" said John. ""I felt like I had something to offer, but I was being told that I wasn't good enough."" John is not alone. The Prison Reform Trust found that there are many other ex-prisoners who have been denied the opportunity to become prison advisers. This is a waste of talent and experience. The government needs to review the current restrictions on ex-prisoner advisers. These restrictions are unfair and they are preventing ex-prisoners from making a positive contribution to society. Ex-prisoners can offer unique insights Ex-prisoners have a unique understanding of the prison system and the challenges faced by prisoners. They can offer valuable insights to prison staff and to other prisoners. For example, ex-prisoners can help prisoners to understand the rules and regulations of the prison. They can also help prisoners to cope with the stress and isolation of prison life. In addition, ex-prisoners can help prisoners to prepare for their release. They can provide information about housing, employment, and other resources. Ex-prisoners can make a positive contribution to society Ex-prisoners who have turned their lives around can make a positive contribution to society. They can help other prisoners to turn their lives around. They can also raise awareness of the challenges faced by prisoners. In addition, ex-prisoners can help to reduce crime. They can provide support and guidance to ex-prisoners who are trying to stay out of trouble. The government needs to recognize the potential of ex-prisoners. It needs to remove the barriers that prevent ex-prisoners from making a positive contribution to society.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pirated Rihanna songs land Frenchman in court,"A French man has been ordered to pay more than €10,000 (£8,600) in damages after illegally downloading and sharing songs by Rihanna. The case was brought by Universal Music France, which represents the singer's record label, Def Jam Recordings. The court in Nanterre, near Paris, heard that the man had downloaded 14 of Rihanna's songs from illegal file-sharing websites. He had then shared the songs with others via peer-to-peer networks. Universal Music France argued that the man's actions had caused significant financial damage to the company. The court agreed and ordered the man to pay €10,000 in damages, as well as €1,000 in legal costs. This is the first time that a French court has ordered someone to pay damages for illegally downloading and sharing music. The case is likely to set a precedent for future cases involving copyright infringement. The music industry has been battling against piracy for many years. In recent years, the problem has been exacerbated by the rise of illegal file-sharing websites. These websites allow users to download music for free, without paying the artists or their record labels. The music industry estimates that it loses billions of dollars each year due to piracy. This has led to a number of lawsuits against individuals and companies that have been involved in copyright infringement. The case against the French man is a significant victory for the music industry. It sends a clear message that piracy will not be tolerated. In addition to the financial damages, the man has also been given a suspended prison sentence. This means that he will not have to go to prison unless he commits another crime within a certain period of time. The case is a warning to others who may be considering illegally downloading or sharing music. The music industry is taking a tough stance on piracy, and those who are caught could face serious consequences.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Manchester students want statue of 'racist' Gandhi rejected,"Manchester students want statue of 'racist' Gandhi rejected Students at the University of Manchester have launched a petition calling for the removal of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi from campus, arguing that he was a ""racist"" who held views that are ""incompatible with the values of the university."" The petition, which has so far gathered over 1,000 signatures, states that Gandhi ""made numerous derogatory remarks about black people, referring to them as 'inferior' and 'uncivilized.'"" It also cites his support for the caste system in India, which discriminates against lower castes. The students argue that Gandhi's views on race and caste are ""incompatible with the values of equality and inclusivity that the university upholds."" They say that the statue ""sends a message that these values are not important"" and that it is ""offensive"" to students of color. The university has said that it is ""aware of the concerns raised by students"" and that it is ""considering the matter."" A spokesperson said that the university is ""committed to creating an inclusive environment for all students"" and that it will ""take into account the views of all stakeholders"" when making a decision about the statue. The debate over Gandhi's legacy has been ongoing for many years. Some historians have argued that his views on race and caste were a product of his time and that he should not be judged by today's standards. Others have argued that his views were racist and that he should not be celebrated as a hero. The debate over the statue at the University of Manchester is likely to continue for some time. It is a complex issue with no easy answers. However, it is important to have a open and honest discussion about Gandhi's legacy and to consider the views of all stakeholders. Additional information: The statue of Gandhi at the University of Manchester was erected in 1948, two years after India gained independence from British rule.

Northern Ireland rescue teams facing snow drifts up to 18ft,"Northern Ireland rescue teams have been battling snow drifts up to 18ft (5.5m) as they worked to reach stranded motorists and vulnerable people during a severe weather warning. The snow and freezing temperatures have caused widespread disruption across the region, with many roads impassable and schools closed. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said it had received more than 1,000 calls since the snow began falling on Sunday. The service said it was ""experiencing significant delays"" and urged people to only call 999 in an emergency. The Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) said it had received more than 300 calls for help, including reports of people trapped in their homes and vehicles. The FRS said its crews had been working ""tirelessly"" to reach those in need, but warned that conditions were ""extremely challenging"". One of the most challenging rescues was in the village of Cushendall, Co Antrim, where a man was trapped in his car by a snow drift. FRS crews used a snow plow to clear a path to the car and then used a winch to pull the vehicle to safety. The man was uninjured but was taken to hospital as a precaution. In another incident, a woman was rescued from her home in the village of Ballycastle, Co Antrim, after the roof collapsed under the weight of snow. The woman was not injured but was taken to hospital for a check-up. The severe weather warning for Northern Ireland remains in place until 10am on Tuesday. The Met Office has warned that further snow and ice is expected, and has urged people to avoid unnecessary travel. The Department of Infrastructure has said that it is working to clear the roads, but has warned that it will take some time. The department has urged people to only travel if it is absolutely necessary. The snow and ice has also caused disruption to public transport.

Party outlines 'independence plan',"Party outlines 'independence plan' The Scottish National Party (SNP) has outlined plans for an independent Scotland to rejoin the European Union and adopt the euro currency. The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the plans would ""give Scotland the best of both worlds"" - independence and membership of the EU. The SNP's plan is based on a report by the party's Growth Commission, which was published in January. The report argued that an independent Scotland would be able to grow its economy faster than the UK as a whole. The SNP's plans have been welcomed by some in the business community, but have been criticized by others who argue that independence would damage the Scottish economy. The Scottish government has said that it will hold a second referendum on independence if it is clear that there is a majority in favor of it. The first referendum, held in 2014, resulted in a 55% vote to remain part of the UK. However, the SNP argues that the Brexit vote has changed the situation, as Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. The UK government has said that it will not allow a second referendum on independence. The Scottish government has said that it will challenge the UK government's position in court if necessary. The SNP's plan for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU is likely to be a key issue in the next Scottish Parliament election, which is due to be held in May 2021. Reaction to the SNP's plans The SNP's plans have been welcomed by some in the business community. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that the plans ""provide a clear and positive vision for Scotland's future.""

Government denies paying British MP?s trips,"The UK government has denied claims that it has been funding trips taken by British MPs to luxury destinations around the world. The allegations were made in a report by the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which claimed that the government had paid for trips to locations such as the Maldives, Dubai, and the Caribbean. The report claimed that the trips were not related to any official government business and that they had been taken by MPs from all political parties. The government has denied the allegations, saying that there is ""no evidence"" to support them. A government spokesperson said: ""The government does not fund any trips taken by MPs for personal or party political purposes. ""All travel expenses incurred by MPs are subject to strict rules and must be approved in advance by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA)."" IPSA is the independent body responsible for regulating MPs' expenses. The allegations come at a time when the government is facing increasing scrutiny over its spending. In recent months, there have been a number of scandals involving MPs' expenses, including claims that they have been using public money to fund luxury lifestyles. The government has pledged to crack down on MPs' expenses and has introduced a number of new rules to prevent abuses. However, the latest allegations suggest that there is still a long way to go before the issue is resolved. The Daily Telegraph report has caused widespread anger and frustration among the public. Many people believe that MPs should not be using public money to fund luxury trips. There is also growing concern that the government is not doing enough to tackle the issue of MPs' expenses. The government needs to take urgent action to address the public's concerns. It must introduce tougher rules on MPs' expenses and it must ensure that any abuses are punished severely. The government must also be more transparent about its spending and it must provide the public with regular updates on how MPs' expenses are being used.

Concerns over food hygiene 'scores on the doors' plan,"Concerns over food hygiene 'scores on the doors' plan A new plan to introduce a ""scores on the doors"" system for food hygiene ratings in England has been met with mixed reactions. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) wants to make it easier for consumers to make informed choices about where to eat by displaying the hygiene rating of food businesses on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The FSA says the scheme will help to raise standards of food hygiene and give consumers more confidence in the food they are eating. However, some businesses have expressed concerns that the scheme could be unfair and could damage their reputation. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has said that the scheme could be ""disproportionately damaging"" to small businesses, which may not have the resources to achieve the highest ratings. The NFU also argues that the scheme could lead to a ""postcode lottery"" of food hygiene standards, with businesses in poorer areas being more likely to receive lower ratings. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) has also expressed concerns about the scheme, saying that it could lead to ""unfair and inaccurate"" ratings. The FDF argues that the scheme will not take into account the size and complexity of businesses. The FSA has defended the scheme, saying that it is based on a robust risk assessment process and that it will be fair and transparent. The FSA also says that the scheme will help to level the playing field for businesses, by ensuring that all businesses are judged against the same standards. The scheme is due to be introduced in England in October 2022. It will be voluntary for businesses to participate, but the FSA is encouraging all businesses to take part. The FSA says that the scheme will be reviewed after two years to assess its effectiveness.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Zimbabwe's Mnangagwa blames Grace Mugabe faction for blast,"President Emmerson Mnangagwa has accused a faction loyal to former first lady Grace Mugabe of being behind an explosion at a rally that injured him. The blast on Saturday targeted a podium where Mr Mnangagwa and other officials were gathered ahead of an election rally in the second city of Bulawayo. The president was airlifted to hospital in Harare but was discharged after treatment. His claims about who was responsible were made in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Harding. ""It's clear that there are remnants of the old dispensation which still want to destabilise the country,"" he said, referring to the era of his predecessor Robert Mugabe, who was ousted last year. ""There were people… who were saying the president should not come to Bulawayo because he's going to be killed."" Mr Mnangagwa did not directly name Grace Mugabe, but he said that Zanu-PF, the ruling party that he leads, was ""trying to find out if indeed some members of the party are involved"". Mrs Mugabe has not commented on the president's accusation. She has previously denied any involvement in a plot to oust her husband, who resigned in November after 37 years in power. The former first lady is said to have led a faction within Zanu-PF that opposed efforts by the military and war veterans to oust Mr Mugabe. Her insistence that this faction should support Mr Mnangagwa after the coup has reportedly caused divisions within the party. The president's assertion that she is behind the blast has deepened these divisions and may make it harder for him to unite the party ahead of elections due in July. Mr Mnangagwa's claim has also divided opinion among ordinary Zimbabweans. Some believe that the blast was an assassination attempt by a rogue element within Zanu-PF, while others believe it was a ""false flag"" operation staged by the government to justify a crackdown on the opposition. The police have arrested four suspects in connection with the blast, but no formal charges have yet been brought. The government has since imposed a ban on political rallies and increased security measures in Harare and Bulawayo. This has raised concerns among human rights groups that the government is using the blast as a pretext to suppress dissent ahead of the elections.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid: Norwich pub landlord says staff having to 'police rule-benders',"Amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, businesses across the UK are grappling with the challenge of enforcing regulations while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. In Norwich, one pub landlord has expressed frustration over the increasing burden placed on his staff to ""police rule-benders."" David Marjoram, the owner of The Recruiting Sergeant pub, said that while he understands the importance of safety, he is concerned that his employees are being forced into an uncomfortable position. ""It's not fair on my staff to have to be the ones telling customers to wear masks or move outside,"" he said. Marjoram explained that many patrons are becoming increasingly resistant to following the rules, leading to tense confrontations. ""We've had people arguing with us, calling us names, and even threatening to leave,"" he said. ""It's putting a lot of stress on my team."" The issue of enforcing Covid-19 regulations has become a contentious one in many sectors. While some businesses have reported positive experiences with customer compliance, others have faced significant challenges. The hospitality industry, in particular, has been heavily impacted by the pandemic, and many pubs and restaurants are struggling to stay afloat. Marjoram believes that the government needs to provide clearer guidance and support to businesses in this regard. ""We're not asking for much,"" he said. ""Just some clear rules and the resources we need to enforce them fairly."" The government has said that it is committed to supporting businesses during the pandemic and has introduced a number of measures to help them comply with Covid-19 regulations. However, some critics argue that these measures have been insufficient and that businesses are being left to fend for themselves. As the pandemic continues, it remains to be seen how the issue of enforcing Covid-19 regulations will be resolved. In the meantime, businesses like The Recruiting Sergeant are doing their best to strike a balance between protecting their customers and staff while maintaining a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Why has our weather been so wet?,"Why has our weather been so wet? The recent deluge of rain across the UK has left many wondering why our weather has been so wet. There are a number of factors that have contributed to the recent wet spell, including: A jet stream that has been stuck in place The jet stream is a narrow band of high-altitude wind that flows from west to east across the globe. It plays a key role in determining our weather, as it steers low-pressure systems and weather fronts towards the UK. In recent weeks, the jet stream has been stuck in a more southerly position than usual. This has meant that a series of low-pressure systems have been able to track across the UK, bringing with them heavy rain and strong winds. An area of low pressure over the UK In addition to the jet stream, the UK has also been affected by an area of low pressure that has been sitting over the country. This area of low pressure has drawn in moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, which has further contributed to the wet weather. Climate change Climate change is also playing a role in the UK's increasingly wet weather. As the Earth's atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture. This means that when it rains, it tends to rain more heavily. Climate change is also causing the jet stream to become more unstable. This means that it is more likely to get stuck in place, leading to prolonged periods of wet weather. What can we expect in the future? The UK's climate is changing, and we can expect to see more extreme weather events in the future. This includes more frequent and intense periods of wet weather. It is important to be prepared for these changes. We need to invest in flood defenses and other measures to protect our communities from the impacts of flooding. We also need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change. This will help to reduce the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Conclusion The recent wet weather in the UK is a reminder of the changing climate. We need to be prepared for more extreme weather events in the future. We also need to take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Vatican suspends 'bishop of bling' Tebartz-van Elst,"The Vatican has suspended the German bishop known as the ""bishop of bling"" after a scandal over his lavish spending. Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, Bishop of Limburg, has been accused of spending millions of euros on a new residence and other projects. The Vatican said in a statement that Tebartz-van Elst had been ""relieved of his pastoral duties"" and ordered to leave his diocese. The decision was made after an investigation by the Vatican's financial watchdog. The investigation found that Tebartz-van Elst had spent €31 million (£25 million) on his new residence, which is still unfinished. The bishop has also been accused of spending large sums of money on other projects, including a new €1.5 million conference centre and a €500,000 bathtub. The scandal has caused outrage in Germany, where many people have accused Tebartz-van Elst of living a lavish lifestyle while his flock struggles to make ends meet. In a statement, Tebartz-van Elst said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the anger and disappointment his spending had caused. He said he had made ""mistakes"" and that he was ""willing to take responsibility for them"". However, he insisted that he had not acted illegally or unethically. The Vatican's decision to suspend Tebartz-van Elst is a sign that the Catholic Church is taking the scandal seriously. It is also a blow to Tebartz-van Elst, who was seen as a rising star in the German Catholic Church. The bishop's suspension is likely to further damage the Catholic Church's reputation in Germany, which has already been tarnished by a series of sex abuse scandals. It is unclear what the future holds for Tebartz-van Elst. He could be reinstated as bishop of Limburg, but it is also possible that he will be forced to resign. The scandal has raised questions about the Vatican's financial oversight of its dioceses. It is clear that the Vatican needs to do more to ensure that bishops are not spending money extravagantly.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

""I initially found it incredibly difficult to adjust to the lack of structure and routine,"" Chan admits. ""But over time, I realized that this enforced break was exactly what I needed."" With no races to prepare for, Chan shifted her focus to exploring her local park. ""I discovered hidden trails and breathtaking views that I had never noticed before,"" she says. ""The solitude was incredibly restorative."" The lockdown also provided Chan with the time to reassess her priorities. ""I had always been so caught up in my running that I neglected other aspects of my life,"" she explains. ""Suddenly, I had the opportunity to reconnect with old friends, pursue creative hobbies, and simply appreciate the simple things."" One of the most profound changes Chan experienced during lockdown was a shift in her relationship with technology. ""Before, I was constantly glued to my phone and social media,"" she says.

""When I finally resumed training, I noticed a significant improvement in my performance,"" she says. ""I was more present and focused, and I was able to push myself harder than ever before."" While the lockdown has presented challenges, Chan believes it has ultimately been a transformative experience. ""It has taught me the importance of adaptability, gratitude, and living in the moment,"" she reflects. ""I emerged from lockdown a stronger and more resilient person.""

More Bank of England powers to curb housing bubble,"The Bank of England has been granted additional powers to curb a potential housing bubble, in a move that has been welcomed by some and criticized by others. The new powers, which were announced by the Treasury on Wednesday, will allow the Bank to set limits on the amount of money that banks can lend to borrowers for buy-to-let mortgages. The Bank will also be able to require banks to hold more capital against buy-to-let mortgages, making them more expensive for banks to offer. The Treasury said that the new powers were necessary to prevent a housing bubble, which could lead to a sharp fall in house prices and a financial crisis. The Bank of England has warned that house prices are rising too quickly, and that the market is becoming increasingly risky. The new powers have been welcomed by some, who believe that they will help to prevent a housing bubble. However, others have criticized the move, arguing that it will make it more difficult for people to buy homes. The Building Societies Association, which represents building societies, said that the new powers were ""unnecessary and counterproductive"". The association said that the Bank of England already had the tools it needed to prevent a housing bubble, and that the new powers would only make it more difficult for people to buy homes. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents mortgage lenders, said that the new powers were ""a welcome step"". The council said that the new powers would help to prevent a housing bubble, and that they would not make it more difficult for people to buy homes. The new powers will come into effect in October 2023. It is not yet clear what impact the new powers will have on the housing market. However, the Bank of England has said that it will monitor the market closely, and that it will take further action if necessary. In addition to the new powers, the Treasury also announced a number of other measures to help to prevent a housing bubble. These measures include: Increasing the stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let properties. Reducing the amount of tax relief that landlords can claim on mortgage interest payments. Introducing a new tax on the sale of second homes.

Russian spy: Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma,"In the wake of the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury, the UK has been wrestling with a complex dilemma in its relations with Russia. On the one hand, the British government has strongly condemned the attack, which it believes was carried out by Russian agents. Prime Minister Theresa May has expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the country and announced a range of other measures in retaliation. On the other hand, the UK is aware that it has significant economic and diplomatic interests in Russia. The two countries cooperate on a range of issues, including counter-terrorism and nuclear non-proliferation. The Skripal case has highlighted the UK's delicate balancing act in its relations with Russia. The government is under pressure from both the public and its allies to take a tough stance against Russia, but it is also aware of the potential consequences of doing so. The poisoning of the Skripals has been a major blow to the already strained relationship between the UK and Russia. The UK government has accused Russia of being behind the attack, and has expelled Russian diplomats in response. Russia has denied any involvement, and has accused the UK of trying to frame it. The Skripal case is just the latest in a series of incidents that have strained relations between the two countries. In recent years, the UK has accused Russia of interfering in its elections, hacking into its computer systems, and even assassinating its citizens. Russia has denied all of these allegations. The current crisis is the most serious since the Cold War. The UK government has said that it is considering further sanctions against Russia, and has warned that it may even expel more diplomats. Russia has said that it will retaliate if the UK takes any further action. The Skripal case has raised a number of questions about the future of relations between the UK and Russia. Will the two countries be able to rebuild their relationship, or will the current crisis lead to a further deterioration in ties? Only time will tell. In the meantime, the UK government is facing a difficult dilemma. It is under pressure from both the public and its allies to take a tough stance against Russia, but it is also aware of the potential consequences of doing so.

Moffat's participation in the parade was met with thunderous applause and cheers from the gathered crowd. As he marched alongside other LGBT+ activists and allies, he carried a banner that read ""No Outsiders,"" underscoring the message that all members of society, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserve to feel safe and respected.

Despite opposition from some parents and conservative groups, Moffat's unwavering dedication to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment ultimately prevailed. In the aftermath of the controversy, Moffat became a symbol of courage and resilience. His story resonated with countless individuals who had faced discrimination or exclusion based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

‘Happiness Fund’ to help pay debts for up to 1.6m Koreans,"'Happiness Fund' to Help Pay Debts for Up to 1.6m Koreans South Korea is set to launch a ""Happiness Fund"" to help low-income earners pay off their debts, aiming to tackle the issue of household debt that has been a major concern in the country. The fund, which is expected to be implemented in the second half of this year, will provide financial assistance to individuals and families with low incomes and high debt burdens. It is estimated that around 1.6 million Koreans will be eligible for support. The fund will be funded through a combination of government subsidies and private donations. The government has allocated 100 billion won (US$86 million) for the initial phase of the program, and it is expected that additional funds will be raised from private sources. To be eligible for assistance from the fund, individuals must meet certain criteria, including having a low income and a high debt-to-income ratio. The fund will provide grants and low-interest loans to help eligible individuals pay off their debts. The establishment of the ""Happiness Fund"" is a significant step towards addressing the issue of household debt in South Korea. High household debt has been a major concern for the country, as it can lead to financial instability and economic slowdown. According to the Bank of Korea, household debt in South Korea reached a record high of 1,859 trillion won (US$1.6 trillion) in the third quarter of 2022. This represents an increase of around 5% compared to the previous year. The high level of household debt is attributed to several factors, including rising housing prices, low interest rates, and a lack of financial literacy among some consumers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated the problem, as many households have lost income or experienced increased expenses due to the economic downturn. The ""Happiness Fund"" is intended to provide financial relief to low-income households that are struggling with debt. By helping these households pay off their debts, the fund aims to improve their financial well-being and reduce the risk of financial instability. The launch of the ""Happiness Fund"" has been welcomed by consumer groups and experts. They believe that the fund will provide much-needed assistance to low-income earners and help to reduce the burden of household debt in the country. However, some critics have expressed concerns that the fund may not be sufficient to address the масштабปัญหา household debt in South Korea. They argue that the government needs to take further steps to address the root causes of high household debt, such as rising housing prices and low financial literacy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Council gym membership 'too costly',"Council gym membership 'too costly' A local council has been accused of pricing people out of its gyms after increasing membership fees by more than 50%. The council, which runs six leisure centres across the borough, has defended the move, saying it is necessary to cover rising costs. However, critics say the price hike will make it difficult for people on low incomes to access affordable fitness facilities. One gym user, who did not want to be named, said: ""I'm really disappointed with the council for putting up the prices so much. I'm on a tight budget and I can't afford to pay £40 a month for a gym membership."" Another user said: ""The council should be doing more to encourage people to get fit and healthy, not making it more difficult for them."" The council said it had frozen membership fees for the past three years, but that it could no longer afford to subsidise the cost of running its leisure centres. A spokesperson said: ""We understand that some people may find the new prices difficult to afford, but we believe that they are still good value for money."" The council said it offered a range of concessions for people on low incomes, such as free swimming for children and discounted membership for over-60s. However, critics say these concessions do not go far enough. One charity, which provides support to people on low incomes, said: ""The council needs to do more to make its leisure centres affordable for everyone. Increasing membership fees will only make it more difficult for people to get fit and healthy."" The council said it was committed to providing affordable fitness facilities for everyone, and that it would continue to review its pricing structure in the future. In the meantime, residents who are struggling to afford gym membership may want to consider joining a community gym or taking part in free or low-cost fitness classes.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
China bans Tiananmen Square-related web search terms,"China has banned web searches for terms related to the Tiananmen Square massacre, a move that coincides with the anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Searches for terms such as ""June Fourth"", ""Tiananmen Square incident"", and ""Tiananmen Square mothers"" returned no results on major Chinese search engines, including Baidu, Sogou, and Shenma. The ban is part of a wider crackdown on dissent in China, which has seen the suppression of free speech, the detention of activists, and the tightening of internet controls. The Tiananmen Square massacre took place on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese government sent troops to crush a peaceful protest movement calling for democratic reforms. Hundreds of protesters were killed, and thousands more were injured. The Chinese government has never fully acknowledged the massacre, and it remains a taboo subject in the country. Public discussion of the event is heavily censored, and people who speak out about it often face retaliation. The ban on web searches for Tiananmen Square-related terms is the latest example of the Chinese government's efforts to erase the memory of the massacre. However, the ban is unlikely to stop people from learning about the event. There are still many ways to access information about the massacre, including through foreign websites and social media platforms. The Tiananmen Square massacre is a reminder of the Chinese government's brutality and its disregard for human rights. The ban on web searches for terms related to the massacre is a further attempt to silence dissent and prevent people from learning about this dark chapter in Chinese history. Despite the government's efforts, the Tiananmen Square massacre will not be forgotten. The memory of the victims lives on, and the struggle for democracy in China continues. In addition to the ban on web searches, the Chinese government has also taken other steps to suppress discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre. These include: Blocking access to foreign websites and social media platforms that host content about the massacre Deleting posts about the massacre from Chinese social media platforms Detaining and harassing people who speak out about the massacre Rewriting history textbooks to downplay the massacre These measures show that the Chinese government is determined to erase the memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre. However, the massacre is a part of Chinese history, and it will not be forgotten.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Mali coup: Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta flies to UAE,"Mali's ousted president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta has left the country and flown to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a government spokesman has said. The 75-year-old, who resigned on Tuesday after being detained by military officers, left the capital Bamako on Wednesday evening. The spokesman did not say why Keïta had gone to the UAE. Keïta's departure came hours after the military announced that it had seized power and dissolved the government and parliament. The coup leaders, who call themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), have said they will hold new elections within a ""reasonable time"". The military has also said it will release all political prisoners and respect international agreements. Keïta's resignation came after months of protests against his rule. Demonstrators had accused him of corruption, nepotism and failing to tackle the country's security problems. The coup has been condemned by the African Union, the United Nations and the European Union. The international community has called for the military to restore civilian rule as soon as possible. The coup is the fourth in Mali since independence from France in 1960. The country has been plagued by instability and violence in recent years, including an ongoing jihadist insurgency. The military has played a key role in Mali's politics since independence, and has often intervened in times of crisis. The coup leaders have said they are committed to democracy, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to bring stability to Mali. The country faces a number of challenges, including the ongoing jihadist insurgency, ethnic tensions and poverty. The international community will be watching closely to see how the military handles these challenges and whether it will be able to restore civilian rule.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Colour-coded school performance ratings revealed in Wales,"Colour-coded school performance ratings revealed in Wales Schools in Wales have been given colour-coded performance ratings for the first time, under a new system designed to provide parents and the public with more information about how well schools are performing. The ratings, which range from green (excellent) to red (unsatisfactory), are based on a range of factors, including pupil attainment, progress and attendance. The ratings were published by the Welsh Government on Thursday, and they show that the majority of schools in Wales are performing well. Around two-thirds of schools were rated green or yellow (good), while just over 10% were rated red. The ratings are designed to help parents make informed choices about which school to send their children to, and to help schools identify areas where they need to improve. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""These ratings will provide parents and the public with clear and accessible information about how well schools are performing. ""They will also help schools to identify areas where they need to improve, and to target their resources accordingly."" The ratings have been welcomed by some, but others have expressed concerns about the potential for them to be used to create a league table of schools. The Welsh Government has said that it does not intend to create a league table, and that the ratings should be used to support schools, not to rank them. However, some critics have argued that the ratings could still be used to create a de facto league table, and that this could lead to schools being unfairly compared to each other. The Welsh Government has said that it will monitor the use of the ratings and will take steps to prevent them from being used to create a league table. The ratings are part of a wider package of reforms to the school system in Wales. Other reforms include the introduction of a new curriculum, and changes to the way that teachers are trained and paid. The Welsh Government believes that these reforms will help to improve standards in schools and to ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to succeed.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi: Egyptian president may rule until 2034,"Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi could potentially remain in power until 2034 after the passing of constitutional amendments in a referendum. The changes, which were approved by 88.83% of voters, have sparked concerns about the country's democratic future. Al-Sisi, who came to power in a 2013 military coup, has faced criticism for his crackdown on dissent and his authoritarian rule. The new amendments have raised fears that he will further consolidate his power and stifle opposition. One of the most significant changes introduced by the amendments is the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. This means that al-Sisi could potentially serve two more terms in office, taking him to 2034. The amendments also give the president the power to appoint the heads of the judiciary and the public prosecutor. This could potentially give al-Sisi control over the entire justice system, further undermining the independence of the judiciary. In addition, the amendments create a new upper house of parliament, the Senate. The Senate will have the power to approve or reject legislation passed by the lower house, the House of Representatives. However, the Senate will be dominated by al-Sisi's supporters, giving him effective control over the legislative process. The amendments also include a number of other provisions that could further strengthen al-Sisi's grip on power. For example, they give the president the power to declare a state of emergency without the approval of parliament. They also allow the president to issue decrees that have the force of law, bypassing the need for parliamentary approval. The passing of the constitutional amendments has been condemned by human rights groups and opposition politicians. They argue that the amendments will further entrench authoritarian rule in Egypt and undermine the country's democratic institutions. The international community has also expressed concern about the amendments. The United States has said that it is ""concerned about the implications of the constitutional amendments for Egypt's democratic development."" The European Union has also said that it is ""monitoring the situation closely."" Al-Sisi's supporters argue that the amendments are necessary to provide stability and security in Egypt. They say that the country is facing a number of challenges, including terrorism and economic instability, and that a strong leader is needed to guide the country through these difficult times. However, critics argue that the amendments will only serve to further suppress dissent and stifle opposition. They say that Egypt needs a democratic system that allows for the free expression of ideas and the peaceful transfer of power.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Grenfell Tower fire: Downing Street criticises council over aborted meeting,"Downing Street has criticised Kensington and Chelsea Council over its decision to cancel a meeting due to be held on Tuesday, which had been scheduled to discuss the Grenfell Tower fire. The meeting had been arranged by the Communities Secretary, James Brokenshire, and was intended to bring together residents' groups, the council, and central government representatives. However, the council announced it was calling off the meeting due to security concerns, after consultation with the police. A Number 10 spokesperson said: ""We regret that Kensington and Chelsea Council has taken this decision at such short notice and without prior discussion with the government."" The spokesperson added that the government believed it was ""vital"" for the meeting to go ahead, and that ""residents need to have their voices heard"". The Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed the lives of at least 80 people in June, has raised questions about the council's handling of the disaster, and its relationship with residents. The council has been accused of failing to listen to residents' concerns about the safety of the tower, and of not doing enough to help those affected by the fire. The decision to cancel the meeting has further angered residents, who say they are being denied the opportunity to have their say about the fire. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: ""This is a kick in the teeth. We have been waiting for months for this meeting, and now it's been cancelled at the last minute. It's clear that the council doesn't want to listen to us."" The council said it had taken the decision to cancel the meeting after receiving advice from the police that there was a ""credible threat"" to the safety of those attending.

Margaret Thatcher's criticism of Brixton riot response revealed,"Margaret Thatcher's Criticism of Brixton Riot Response Revealed Newly released documents have shed light on Margaret Thatcher's harsh criticism of the police response to the Brixton riots of 1981. The riots, which began on April 10th, 1981, were sparked by the fatal shooting of a black man, Cherry Groce, by a police officer during a traffic stop. Four days of rioting followed, resulting in 297 police officers and 111 civilians being injured, and significant damage to property. In the aftermath of the riots, Thatcher expressed deep dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the situation. Cabinet papers released under the 30-year rule show that she accused the police of ""total lack of control"" and ""gross incompetence."" In a letter to Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, Thatcher wrote: ""I must say that I think the police lost control of the situation, and there was a serious lack of co-ordination between the different forces involved... As a result, the public lost confidence in the police and there was a serious breakdown in law and order."" Thatcher's criticism extended beyond the immediate response to the riots. She expressed concern that the police had failed to engage with the black community in Brixton before the violence erupted. ""It is clear that there is a serious problem of police-community relations, particularly in Brixton,"" Thatcher wrote. ""The police must do more to reach out to the black community and earn their trust. Otherwise, there will be further trouble in the future."" She also called for a review of police training and tactics to ensure that officers were better prepared to deal with riots and other public order incidents. Thatcher's criticism of the police response to the Brixton riots added to the tensions between her government and the Metropolitan Police. The riots had already prompted a major inquiry into police powers, which ultimately led to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The release of the cabinet papers provides fresh insights into Thatcher's views on law and order, police accountability, and race relations. They also highlight the ongoing challenges of policing diverse communities and maintaining trust between the police and the public.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Flood-hit Tewkesbury farmer 'unable to plant crops',"A farmer whose land was ravaged by flooding two years ago says he is still unable to plant crops because the Environment Agency has not repaired a flood defence.

The Environment Agency says it is working to repair the flood defence, but Mr Frowen says the work is taking too long. ""It's been two years since the floods and I'm still unable to plant crops on a significant proportion of my land,"" he said. ""The Environment Agency has a duty to protect people and property from flooding, but they are failing in that duty.""

The group had said it wanted to buy the bus station for £1 and turn it into a community hub. But the council said it had received other bids for the site, which it would now consider. The bus station closed in 2020 after being deemed unsafe. It has since been earmarked for demolition as part of the city's £200m Tithebarn regeneration project. The Preston Bus Station Action Group, which has more than 4,000 members, has been campaigning to save the building.

EU immigration - the Croatian solution?,"EU Immigration - The Croatian Solution? Croatia's accession to the European Union in 2013 marked a significant turning point for the country. As a new member state, Croatia became subject to EU freedom of movement rules, allowing its citizens to travel and work freely within the bloc. In the years that followed, Croatia experienced a substantial outflow of its population. According to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics, over 300,000 Croatian citizens emigrated between 2013 and 2018, mainly to Germany, Austria, and Ireland. This mass exodus has had a profound impact on Croatia's economy and society. In an effort to stem the tide of emigration, the Croatian government has implemented a range of measures, including increasing public investment, providing tax breaks to businesses, and improving infrastructure. However, these efforts have had limited success. In recent years, the Croatian government has begun to look to the EU for solutions to its emigration problem. One potential solution that has been explored is the Croatian solution. The Croatian solution is a proposal by the Croatian government to grant all Croatian citizens who have emigrated to the EU the right to return to Croatia and settle there permanently. This would give Croatian citizens the same rights as other EU citizens, who can move freely within the bloc and settle in any member state. The Croatian solution has been met with mixed reactions. Some experts believe that it could help to stem the flow of emigration from Croatia, while others argue that it could create a brain drain and deprive the country of skilled workers and professionals. The Croatian government is currently in negotiations with the EU over the Croatian solution. If successful, it would be a significant development in EU immigration policy and could have implications for other member states facing similar challenges. The Croatian Experience Croatia's experience with EU immigration is a complex one. The country has benefited from the free movement of workers, which has helped to boost its economy and fill labor shortages. However, it has also experienced a significant outflow of its population, which has had a negative impact on its economy and society. The Croatian solution is an attempt to address this issue and keep more Croatian citizens in the country. However, it remains to be seen whether this solution will be successful. Only time will tell whether the Croatian solution will stem the flow of emigration from Croatia and help to revitalize its economy and society.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Uber agrees to 20 years of privacy audits to settle FTC charges,"Uber has agreed to 20 years of privacy audits and other measures to settle charges by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it misled consumers about how it shared their data with third parties. The FTC alleged that Uber's privacy practices violated a 2016 consent order that required the ride-hailing company to get users' explicit consent before sharing their data with third parties. The agency also alleged that Uber made false claims about the security of its app and failed to take reasonable steps to protect users' personal information. Uber has agreed to pay $20 million to settle the charges. The company also agreed to: Obtain consumers' explicit consent before sharing their data with third parties. Implement a comprehensive privacy program that includes regular audits and employee training. Appoint a privacy officer responsible for overseeing the company's privacy practices. Submit quarterly reports to the FTC on its compliance with the consent order. The FTC's action against Uber is part of a broader crackdown on companies that misuse consumers' personal information. The agency has recently taken action against Facebook, Google, and other tech giants for privacy violations. Uber's settlement with the FTC is a significant victory for consumer privacy advocates. It sends a strong message that companies must be transparent about how they collect and use consumers' personal information and that they will be held accountable for any violations of the law. ""This settlement is a major victory for consumers,"" said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. ""Uber deceived consumers about how it was using their data, and it failed to take reasonable steps to protect their privacy. This settlement will help ensure that Uber treats consumers' personal information fairly and that it complies with the law."" Uber's privacy practices have been under scrutiny for several years. In 2017, the company disclosed that a hacker had stolen the personal information of 57 million Uber users and drivers. The company was also criticized for its use of surge pricing, which increases the cost of rides during periods of high demand. Uber's new privacy measures are designed to address these concerns. The company has promised to be more transparent about how it collects and uses consumers' personal information, and it has implemented a number of new security measures to protect users' data. Uber's settlement with the FTC is a positive step forward for the company. It is a sign that Uber is taking its privacy obligations seriously and that it is committed to protecting consumers' personal information.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Venezuela's Maduro 'optimistic' as crisis talks resume,"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has expressed optimism as talks between the government and opposition resume in Mexico City. The negotiations, which had been suspended for over a year, aim to resolve the country's political crisis and pave the way for free and fair elections. Speaking at a televised event, Maduro said he was ""very optimistic"" about the talks and hoped they would lead to ""a peaceful solution"" to the crisis. ""We are here to dialogue, to negotiate, to reach agreements that will allow us to live in peace and democracy,"" he said. The opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, has welcomed the resumption of talks but has also expressed skepticism about Maduro's intentions. ""We are going to these negotiations with a clear objective: to achieve free and fair elections,"" Guaidó said in a statement. ""We are not going to accept any false promises or delays."" The talks are being facilitated by Norway and have been endorsed by the international community. The United States, which has recognized Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, has said it supports the talks and hopes they will lead to a ""peaceful and democratic solution"" to the crisis. The European Union has also welcomed the resumption of talks and has urged both sides to engage in ""constructive dialogue."" The Venezuelan crisis began in 2015 when the opposition won a majority in the National Assembly. Maduro's government responded by stripping the Assembly of its powers and jailing opposition leaders. The crisis escalated in 2019 when Guaidó declared himself interim president. The United States and dozens of other countries recognized Guaidó as the legitimate president, but Maduro has retained control of the military and government institutions. The Venezuelan economy has been devastated by the crisis, with hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country in recent years. The talks in Mexico City are seen as a potential breakthrough in the crisis. However, it remains to be seen whether the two sides can reach an agreement that will lead to free and fair elections and a peaceful resolution to the crisis.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Benefit sanctions force people to sleep rough, claims charity","Benefit sanctions are a form of punishment for people who fail to meet the conditions of their welfare payments. These conditions can include attending job interviews, taking part in workfare schemes, or providing evidence that they are actively looking for work. If someone fails to meet these conditions, their benefits can be stopped or reduced. In recent years, the use of benefit sanctions has increased significantly. In 2010, there were just over 300,000 benefit sanctions issued. By 2018, that number had risen to over 1.6 million. This increase has led to growing concerns about the impact of benefit sanctions on people's lives. One of the most concerning impacts of benefit sanctions is that they can force people to sleep rough. A study by the charity Crisis found that over a quarter of people who had been sanctioned had slept rough at some point in the past year. This is because benefit sanctions can leave people with no money to pay for food or accommodation. In addition to the risk of homelessness, benefit sanctions can also have a range of other negative consequences. These can include increased poverty, mental health problems, and social isolation. Critics of benefit sanctions argue that they are a cruel and ineffective way to get people into work. They point out that many people who are sanctioned are already looking for work, but they are unable to find a job due to factors such as a lack of skills or experience. They also argue that benefit sanctions can make it more difficult for people to find work, as they can lead to people losing their homes and their support networks. The government has defended the use of benefit sanctions, arguing that they are necessary to encourage people to look for work and to reduce the cost of the welfare system. However, the evidence suggests that benefit sanctions are not effective in getting people into work and that they can have a range of negative consequences for people's lives. In conclusion, benefit sanctions are a form of punishment for people who fail to meet the conditions of their welfare payments. While the government argues that they are necessary to encourage people to look for work and to reduce the cost of the welfare system, the evidence suggests that benefit sanctions are not effective in getting people into work and that they can have a range of negative consequences for people's lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The move comes after police said they had received ""credible information"" of a potential threat to the summit. The exclusion zone now extends for a radius of 10 miles around the resort, and includes the main road between Enniskillen and Omagh. Police have set up roadblocks on all roads leading into the exclusion zone, and are stopping and searching vehicles. They have also advised people to avoid the area if possible. The G8 summit is being held at the Lough Erne Resort from Monday 17 June to Tuesday 18 June. World leaders, including US President Barack Obama, UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will be attending the summit. The summit is expected to focus on a range of issues, including the global economy, climate change and the Syrian civil war. The extension of the exclusion zone has been met with mixed reactions from local residents. Some have welcomed the move, saying it will help to keep the summit safe. Others have expressed concern about the impact it will have on their lives. One resident, who lives in Kesh, said: ""I'm worried about how I'm going to get to work. ""The main road is closed, so I'll have to take a long detour."" Another resident said: ""I'm not sure why they need to extend the exclusion zone so far. ""It's going to cause a lot of inconvenience for people."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said it understands the concerns of local residents, but that the extension of the exclusion zone is necessary to ensure the safety of the summit. A PSNI spokesperson said: ""We have received credible information of a potential threat to the summit.

Tom Ballard: 'Silhouettes' spotted in missing climber search,"Climber Tom Ballard: 'Silhouettes' spotted during search operation Authorities searching for missing British climber Tom Ballard on Nanga Parbat, often referred to as ""Killer Mountain,"" have spotted silhouettes that could potentially be the 30-year-old and his climbing partner, Daniele Nardi. The pair disappeared on February 24 while attempting to scale the 8,126-meter (26,660-foot) peak in Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region. Their last communication was a text message sent by Nardi at 5:30 a.m. Pakistani time on February 23, claiming to have reached an altitude of 6,300 meters (20,670 feet). Helicopter crews using thermal imaging equipment have identified several silhouettes, but none have yet been confirmed to be those of Ballard and Nardi. Ballard's mother, Alison Hargreaves, who was the first British woman to summit Mount Everest, has expressed cautious optimism about the potential sighting. ""We urge everyone to remain calm and respectful of the search and rescue operation,"" Hargreaves said in a statement. A team of Pakistani high-altitude climbers led by Muhammad Ali Sadpara is currently ascending the mountain to search for the missing climbers. The team is equipped with oxygen tanks and food supplies to enable them to remain at high altitude for as long as possible. The search operation has been hampered by poor weather conditions, including high winds and snowfall. However, authorities are determined to continue their efforts until all possible leads have been exhausted. ""We have been working day and night since we received the distress call,"" said Pakistan's Alpine Club secretary, Karrar Haidri. ""We are doing everything we can to find Tom and Daniele, but we need to be realistic about the challenges we face."" Nardi, 42, is an experienced climber with a successful track record of high-altitude ascents. He has previously attempted to summit Nanga Parbat twice before, in 2016 and 2017. Ballard, who is the son of renowned climber Alison Hargreaves and renowned Pakistani mountaineer Muhammad Ali Sadpara, has emerged as one of Britain's most promising young climbers. He became the first person to free climb the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps in 2018.

Toppled Pontfadog Oak in Chirk moved off house,"Toppled Pontfadog Oak in Chirk moved off house A 1,000-year-old oak tree that toppled onto a house in Chirk, Wrexham, has been carefully lifted off the property and transported to a nearby field. The Pontfadog Oak, which is thought to be one of the oldest trees in Britain, fell during Storm Eunice in February, causing significant damage to the house it landed on. Specialist contractors were brought in to remove the tree, which was lifted off the house using a crane and transported to a field near to where it originally stood. The tree, which has a trunk diameter of 6ft (1.8m), is now being assessed by experts to determine whether it can be replanted. Denbighshire council's lead member for highways, waste and the environment, Councillor Brian Jones, said: ""This was a very delicate operation, and we are grateful to the contractors for their expertise in removing the tree safely. ""We are now working with experts to assess the tree's condition and determine whether it can be replanted. We are hopeful that we can save this iconic tree and give it a new lease of life.""

Ex-Gaddafi Tuareg fighters boost Mali rebels,"Ex-Gaddafi Tuareg fighters boost Mali rebels ByBBC News, Bamako* Tuareg fighters who fought for Libya's late leader Muammar Gaddafi are joining up with the Tuareg-led rebel group in northern Mali, the Movement for the National Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). The MNLA is fighting for the independence of the vast desert region of Azawad, which it declared independent in April. The government in Bamako has rejected the declaration of independence and is preparing a military offensive to retake the region. The MNLA is made up of Tuareg fighters who fought for Gaddafi in the Libyan civil war. After Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in October 2011, many of these fighters returned to Mali and joined the MNLA. The MNLA is also being joined by Tuareg fighters from Niger and Burkina Faso. The influx of experienced fighters has boosted the MNLA's military capabilities. The group has been able to capture several towns in northern Mali, including the regional capital, Gao. The government in Bamako is concerned about the growing strength of the MNLA. The government has accused the MNLA of receiving support from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). AQIM is a terrorist group that operates in the Sahel region of North Africa. The government has also accused the MNLA of carrying out human rights abuses, including summary executions and torture. The MNLA has denied these accusations. The MNLA says it is fighting for the rights of the Tuareg people, who have been marginalized by the government in Bamako. The Tuareg are a nomadic people who have traditionally lived in the Sahara desert. They have been fighting for independence for decades. The MNLA is the latest in a series of Tuareg rebel groups to fight for independence. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Tuareg fought a war against the government in Bamako. The war ended in a peace agreement in 1991. However, the peace agreement was not fully implemented and the Tuareg continued to feel marginalized. In 2007, the Tuareg launched a new rebellion. The rebellion was crushed by the government in 2009. The MNLA is the latest incarnation of the Tuareg rebellion. The group is determined to fight for the independence of Azawad. The government in Bamako is determined to crush the rebellion. The conflict in northern Mali is likely to continue for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Street advertising boards to be banned in Edinburgh,"Street Advertising Boards to Be Banned in Edinburgh In a move towards enhancing the city's visual aesthetics and reducing clutter, Edinburgh is set to become the first city in the UK to ban street advertising boards. The decision, approved by the city council, aims to create a more cohesive and visually appealing urban environment. Street advertising boards have long been a fixture in our cities, but their proliferation has raised concerns about their impact on the aesthetic value of public spaces. Critics argue that these boards create visual pollution, distracting from the beauty of historic buildings and natural landmarks. Edinburgh, renowned for its stunning architecture and picturesque streets, has been particularly affected by advertising clutter. The council's decision to ban them is seen as a positive step towards preserving the city's unique character. The ban will apply to all street advertising boards, including billboards, posters, and sandwich boards. Exceptions will be made for certain public information signs, such as those for bus stops and road safety. The ban is expected to come into effect in 2024, allowing businesses and advertisers time to adapt. The council will work with businesses to explore alternative advertising methods, such as digital displays and online platforms. The decision has been welcomed by heritage groups and conservationists. Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for protecting Scotland's built heritage, has praised the council for taking action to preserve Edinburgh's unique streetscape. The ban is also seen as a step towards reducing the environmental impact of advertising. Street advertising boards often use non-recyclable materials and contribute to litter. While the ban may have some impact on businesses that rely on street advertising, the council believes that the benefits to the city as a whole will outweigh any potential drawbacks. By removing street advertising boards, Edinburgh aims to create a more welcoming and visually appealing environment for residents and visitors alike. The ban is seen as a bold step towards shaping a more sustainable and aesthetically pleasing city. The decision to ban street advertising boards in Edinburgh has sparked a wider debate about the role of advertising in our public spaces. As other cities consider similar measures, Edinburgh's example may pave the way for a more balanced approach to urban advertising that respects the visual integrity of our cities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

'Financial tsunami' forced police officers to retire,"Amidst the economic turmoil that swept the globe in 2008, countless individuals and industries bore the brunt of the financial tsunami's devastating impact. Among those affected were the very people sworn to protect and serve our communities: police officers. As governments grappled with severe budget cuts and financial constraints, many police departments across the country were forced to make difficult decisions. Faced with dwindling resources and a shrinking revenue stream, they had no choice but to implement cost-saving measures that would ultimately lead to the premature retirement of experienced and dedicated officers. The consequences of these retirements were far-reaching. With fewer officers on the force, response times to emergencies and investigations slowed down. The loss of valuable experience and expertise also hindered the ability of police departments to effectively address complex crimes and community issues. Furthermore, the forced retirements had a significant impact on the morale of the remaining officers. Many felt betrayed and disillusioned by the lack of support from the very institutions they had served with distinction. The feeling of being undervalued and dispensable weighed heavily on the minds of those who continued to don the badge. In addition to the operational challenges, the mass retirements also affected the overall safety and well-being of communities. With fewer officers patrolling the streets, criminals became more brazen in their activities. The absence of a visible police presence emboldened offenders and led to an increase in crime rates in some areas. Recognizing the severity of the situation, some police departments implemented innovative strategies to mitigate the impact of the retirements. These included: Offering early retirement packages with incentives to encourage experienced officers to stay on the force longer. Exploring partnerships with other law enforcement agencies to share resources and personnel. Initiating recruitment campaigns to attract and hire qualified candidates to fill the void left by retiring officers. While these measures helped to alleviate some of the pressure, they could not fully compensate for the loss of so many experienced and dedicated officers. The financial tsunami had left an indelible mark on police departments across the country, and its consequences would continue to be felt for years to come. In the aftermath of the crisis, there was a growing recognition of the importance of investing in public safety and providing adequate support for law enforcement agencies. The lesson learned from the 'financial tsunami' was that underfunding and undermining the police force could have severe and long-lasting repercussions for society as a whole.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Wisbech murder: Dzilva Butiene 'relied' on man who killed her,"In the aftermath of the tragic murder of Dzilva Butiene in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, the trial at Peterborough Crown Court has revealed the chilling details surrounding her untimely death. The victim, a vulnerable woman in her 60s, was brutally killed in her own home on January 12, 2023. The prosecution presented evidence indicating that Dzilva Butiene had developed a dependency on the defendant, Jonas Mikalauskas, a Lithuanian national who had been staying at her residence for several weeks. While initially, it was believed that Mikalauskas had played a protective role in Butiene's life, the trial has painted a different picture. According to the prosecution, Mikalauskas took advantage of Butiene's vulnerability, exploiting her need for companionship and financial assistance. He allegedly controlled her bank accounts, withdrew large sums of money without her knowledge, and isolated her from her friends and family. On the fateful night of the murder, the court heard that a violent argument erupted between the two. Mikalauskas subjected Butiene to a sustained and brutal attack, causing multiple injuries to her head and body. Her frail body was discovered by police officers who had been called to the scene following a report of a disturbance. During the trial, evidence was presented suggesting that Mikalauskas had a history of violence and aggression. Witnesses testified to his volatile temper and his tendency to lash out when things did not go his way. The prosecution argued that Mikalauskas's actions were deliberate and motivated by greed and a desire to exert control over Butiene. They emphasized the extent to which the victim had relied on the defendant, only to be met with violence and betrayal. The jury has now retired to consider their verdict. If convicted of murder, Mikalauskas faces a mandatory life sentence. The trial has highlighted the dangers faced by vulnerable people who may fall prey to those who seek to exploit them. It serves as a reminder of the importance of reaching out to those in need and ensuring that they have access to support and protection.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Covid lockdown: 'My closed hair salons cost me £1,000 a day'","In the face of the ongoing Covid lockdown, the beauty industry has been left reeling, with hair salons being forced to close their doors. For many salon owners, the financial implications have been severe, with some losing thousands of pounds each day. One such salon owner is Emma, who runs a hair salon in London. Prior to the lockdown, her salon was thriving, with a steady stream of clients booking appointments. However, since the lockdown was imposed, her business has come to a standstill. ""It's been devastating,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm losing around £1,000 a day. I've had to furlough my staff, and I'm worried that I won't be able to afford to reopen when the lockdown is lifted."" Emma is not alone in her struggles. According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, the hair and beauty industry is losing an estimated £1.5 billion a month as a result of the lockdown. The closure of hair salons has had a significant impact on the mental health of many people. For some, regular hair appointments are an essential part of their self-care routine. Being unable to get their hair cut or styled can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. ""For many people, their hair is a big part of their identity,"" said Emma. ""When they can't get it cut or styled, it can really affect their confidence."" In addition to the financial and emotional impact, the closure of hair salons has also had a knock-on effect on other businesses. For example, many hair salons also sell products such as shampoos, conditioners, and styling tools. When salons are closed, these businesses lose out on potential sales. The government has announced a number of support measures for businesses affected by the lockdown, including grants and loans. However, many salon owners say that these measures are not enough to cover their losses. ""The government needs to do more to help businesses like mine,"" said Emma. ""We're facing an uncertain future, and we need to know that we're going to be able to survive.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The Fishlake Inn provided hot meals to the stranded residents, while the local Co-op donated food and other essential supplies to those in need. ""The community spirit has been incredible,"" said local councilor John Burrows. ""People have gone above and beyond to help their neighbors. It's heartwarming to see how everyone has pulled together in these difficult times."" As the floodwaters gradually receded, the community continued to support the clean-up effort. Volunteers from the local church and other community groups helped remove debris from homes and businesses. The Fishlake floods have left a devastating impact on the community, but they have also brought out the best in people. The heroic actions of ordinary individuals and the outpouring of support from all quarters have been a beacon of light amidst the darkness. As the recovery process continues, the community of Fishlake will undoubtedly draw strength from the bonds that have been forged during this challenging time. The floods may have separated their homes, but they have brought their hearts and spirits closer together.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Burger King remove 'racist' chopsticks ad,"Burger King has removed an advertisement for its new 'Oriental' burger after it was branded ""racist"" by viewers. The advert, which was posted on Facebook, featured a woman using chopsticks to eat the burger. Many people criticised the advert, saying that it was stereotypical and perpetuated harmful stereotypes about Asian people. Burger King has since apologised for the advert and said that it was ""unacceptable"". The company has also removed the advert from its social media channels. The advert has sparked a debate about the use of cultural stereotypes in advertising. Some people believe that it is acceptable to use stereotypes in advertising if they are done in a humorous or light-hearted way. Others believe that stereotypes are always harmful, as they can reinforce negative stereotypes about particular groups of people. The Burger King advert is not the first time that a company has been accused of using racist advertising. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of companies using racist imagery or language in their advertising. These cases have led to calls for greater diversity in the advertising industry. Some people believe that the advertising industry is too white and male, and that this lack of diversity contributes to the creation of racist advertising. Others believe that the advertising industry is not intentionally racist, but that it simply reflects the racist attitudes that exist in society. They argue that the only way to change the advertising industry is to change society as a whole. The debate about the use of cultural stereotypes in advertising is likely to continue for some time. However, the Burger King advert has highlighted the importance of being sensitive to the potential impact of advertising on different groups of people. In a statement, Burger King said: ""We apologise for the insensitive and inappropriate advertisement that we posted on our Facebook page. We have removed the advertisement and we sincerely regret any offence that it may have caused."" The advertising watchdog, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), has said that it is investigating the advert. The ASA has the power to ban advertising that it considers to be offensive or misleading.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Social mobility: Poorer children 'making less progress',"Social mobility in the United Kingdom has stalled, with children from poorer backgrounds making less progress than their wealthier peers, according to a new report. The study, by the Sutton Trust, found that the gap between the richest and poorest pupils has widened in recent years, with children from the poorest families now 18 months behind their wealthier classmates by the age of 16. The report also found that children from poorer backgrounds are less likely to go to university, and those who do are more likely to drop out. They are also less likely to get good jobs and earn high salaries. The Sutton Trust's chief executive, Sir Peter Lampl, said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""Social mobility is not just about giving everyone the same chances in life,"" he said. ""It's about giving everyone the opportunity to reach their full potential. And that's not happening at the moment."" The report's findings echo those of a number of other recent studies, which have all found that social mobility in the UK has stalled or even declined in recent years. One of the key factors behind this decline is the rising cost of living, which has made it increasingly difficult for families on low incomes to make ends meet. This has led to a number of families being forced to cut back on essential spending, such as food and heating, which can have a negative impact on children's education and development. The government has introduced a number of policies in recent years aimed at improving social mobility, such as the pupil premium, which gives extra funding to schools with high numbers of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, these policies have not been fully successful in addressing the underlying causes of social inequality. Experts say that more needs to be done to improve social mobility in the UK, including investing in early years education, providing better support for families on low incomes, and tackling the underlying causes of poverty and disadvantage. ""We need to create a level playing field for all children, regardless of their background,"" said Sir Peter Lampl. ""That means giving them the same opportunities to succeed, and that means tackling the underlying causes of poverty and disadvantage.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Trump’s disinfectant and sunlight claims fact-checked,"Coronavirus: Trump’s Disinfectant and Sunlight Claims Fact-Checked In a recent press conference, US President Donald Trump made several unproven and potentially dangerous claims about the treatment of coronavirus. He suggested that injecting disinfectant into the body could be an effective way to kill the virus, and also that sunlight could cure the disease. These claims have been widely condemned by medical experts, who have warned that they are both ineffective and potentially harmful. Disinfectant Injecting disinfectant into the body is not a safe or effective way to treat coronavirus. Disinfectants are designed to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces, but they are not safe to inject into the human body. In fact, injecting disinfectant can cause serious health problems, including tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning against using disinfectants to treat coronavirus, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also stated that there is no evidence to support the use of disinfectants to treat or prevent the virus. Sunlight Sunlight does not cure coronavirus. While exposure to sunlight can help to boost the immune system, there is no evidence to suggest that it can cure the virus. In fact, excessive exposure to sunlight can actually damage the skin and increase the risk of skin cancer. The CDC recommends that people avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, and that they wear sunscreen and protective clothing when they are outdoors. Trump’s Claims Trump’s claims about the treatment of coronavirus are not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, they are potentially dangerous, and could lead people to take harmful actions. It is important to rely on information from credible sources, such as the CDC, FDA, and World Health Organization, when seeking information about coronavirus. These organizations have a wealth of knowledge and expertise, and they can provide accurate and reliable information about the virus and its treatment.

Male depression 'set to increase',"Male Depression Set to Increase Depression is a serious mental illness that can have a devastating impact on an individual's life. While it can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background, research suggests that men may be at an increased risk of experiencing depression. According to a recent study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, the prevalence of depression among men is expected to rise by 20% in the next decade. Led by researchers from Harvard University, the study analyzed data from over 3 million men and found that the risk of depression increased with age, from 4.2% in men aged 18-24 to 7.5% in men aged 65 and over. The reasons for the increasing prevalence of depression in men are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to this trend. One possible explanation is that men are less likely to seek help for mental health issues due to social stigma and cultural norms that discourage them from expressing their emotions. Another factor is the changing nature of work and family life. Men are increasingly facing pressures to succeed professionally and financially, while also balancing family responsibilities. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy, which can increase the risk of depression. Furthermore, men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as substance abuse and violence, which can further contribute to mental health problems. The consequences of depression can be severe. It can lead to decreased productivity at work, strained relationships, and physical illnesses. In severe cases, depression can lead to suicide. It is important to raise awareness about depression and encourage men to seek help if they are experiencing symptoms. Signs and symptoms of depression include: Persistent sadness or emptiness Loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable Changes in appetite or weight Difficulty sleeping or staying asleep Fatigue or loss of energy Difficulty concentrating or making decisions Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Thoughts of death or suicide If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it is important to seek professional help. There are effective treatments available for depression, such as psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. By breaking down the stigma and providing access to support, we can help men to overcome depression and lead fulfilling lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

African swine fever: Australia expels Vietnamese woman over pork haul,"Australian authorities have deported a Vietnamese woman who attempted to smuggle pork products into the country, amid concerns over African swine fever (ASF). The woman, who arrived in Australia from Vietnam on a tourist visa, was found to be carrying 18 kilograms of pork in her luggage. The pork was vacuum-sealed and hidden in various bags. ASF is a highly contagious viral disease that affects pigs and wild boar. It is not harmful to humans, but it can cause significant economic losses to the pig industry. Australia is free from ASF, and the government has strict biosecurity measures in place to prevent the disease from entering the country. The importation of pork products from ASF-affected countries is prohibited. The woman was detained by Australian Border Force (ABF) officers at Sydney International Airport. She was later charged with importing prohibited goods and failing to declare them on her arrival card. The woman pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a six-month suspended jail sentence. She was also ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. The ABF said the woman's actions posed a ""serious biosecurity risk"" to Australia. ""This was a deliberate attempt to smuggle prohibited goods into the country,"" ABF Commander Kate Ferry said. ""Our officers are vigilant in protecting Australia from biosecurity threats, and we will continue to take strong action against those who break our laws."" The woman's deportation is a reminder of the importance of Australia's biosecurity laws. These laws are designed to protect the country's agriculture industry and environment from the introduction of pests and diseases.

""I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and I've realized it's because of TikTok,"" he said. Cruz explained that the constant need to create and post content had become overwhelming and had led to feelings of anxiety and depression. ""I felt like I was always chasing the next hit of dopamine, the next like or comment,"" he said. ""It was like an addiction."" The singer expressed concern about the potential impact of TikTok on young people, particularly those who are vulnerable to mental health issues. ""I'm worried about the kids who are growing up with this app,"" he said. ""It's creating a culture of comparison and perfectionism that is unhealthy."" Cruz's announcement has sparked a debate about the potential risks of social media use. Some critics have argued that the constant pressure to create and share content can lead to mental health issues, while others have defended TikTok, claiming that it can be a positive platform for self-expression and community building. TikTok has responded to Cruz's concerns by saying that it is committed to creating a safe and supportive environment for its users. The company has introduced a number of features aimed at promoting mental well-being, such as the ability to limit screen time and filter out harmful content.

China 'buys fighter jets and submarines from Russia',"China Expands Military Arsenal with Russian Purchases In a move that underscores China's growing military ambitions, Beijing has reportedly made significant purchases of advanced fighter jets and submarines from Russia. The deals, which were announced during the recent Moscow International Air and Space Salon (MAKS), represent a major boost to China's already formidable military capabilities. According to sources close to the negotiations, China has acquired a batch of Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets, which are widely regarded as one of the most advanced multirole combat aircraft in service today. The Su-35 features advanced avionics, a powerful radar system, and a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. In addition to the fighter jets, China has also purchased a number of Project 636.3 Kilo-class submarines from Russia. The Kilo-class submarines are known for their stealth capabilities, making them ideal for covert operations. They are armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, providing China with a significant underwater advantage. The purchases come at a time of escalating tensions between China and the United States. The two countries have clashed over issues ranging from trade to the South China Sea, raising concerns about the potential for military confrontation. Analysts say that the acquisition of Russian weapons is a clear indication of China's决心 to modernize its military and assert its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. The Su-35 fighter jets will enhance China's air superiority, while the Kilo-class submarines will provide a significant boost to its anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The purchases are also seen as a sign of China's growing diplomatic ties with Russia. Moscow has been a vocal supporter of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and has provided Beijing with diplomatic cover at the United Nations. The United States has expressed concern about China's military buildup, particularly its acquisition of advanced Russian weapons. Washington has called on Beijing to exercise restraint and to engage in dialogue to address regional security concerns. However, China has rejected such calls, insisting that its military modernization is necessary to protect its national security interests. Beijing has also accused the United States of trying to contain China's rise as a global power. The purchases of Russian fighter jets and submarines are likely to further strain relations between China and the United States. They also highlight the growing military capabilities of China and the potential for increased tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Stoke-on-Trent hotel for homeless secures housing for rough sleepers,"In a heartening development, a hotel in Stoke-on-Trent that had been temporarily housing homeless people during the pandemic has now secured permanent housing for over 20 rough sleepers. The initiative, spearheaded by the city council and local charities, has been hailed as a lifeline for those who had previously been living on the streets. The project began in March 2020 when the Britannia Hotel agreed to provide accommodation for rough sleepers during the initial Covid-19 lockdown. The hotel's 100 rooms became a sanctuary for those who had nowhere else to go, offering them a safe and warm place to stay with regular meals and access to support services. The success of the initiative led the city council to extend the partnership with the Britannia Hotel. In addition, funding was secured from the government's Rough Sleeping Accommodation Programme (RSAP) to provide longer-term accommodation for the hotel's residents. Working in collaboration with local charities, the council has now found permanent housing for 22 former rough sleepers who had been staying at the hotel. These individuals have been placed in a variety of accommodation, including council-owned properties, supported housing, and private rented accommodation. The council's cabinet member for housing and regeneration, Councillor Abi Brown, expressed her delight at the positive outcomes achieved through the project. ""This is fantastic news,"" she said. ""We are committed to ending homelessness in Stoke-on-Trent, and this project has played a vital role in helping us to achieve that goal."" She added: ""It is heartening to see that so many people who have been experiencing homelessness have been able to secure permanent housing. This will make a real difference to their lives, providing them with the stability and support they need to rebuild their lives."" One of the former rough sleepers who has now found permanent accommodation is 45-year-old John Smith. John had been living on the streets for several years before he was offered a room at the Britannia Hotel. ""It was a lifeline for me,"" said John. ""I had nowhere else to go, and I was struggling to survive. The hotel gave me a safe place to stay and support to get my life back on track."" John has now been placed in a supported housing scheme where he is receiving help with his mental health and addiction issues. He is also working with a job coach to find employment. ""I am so grateful for the help I have received,"" said John. ""I am now in a much better place, and I am looking forward to the future."" The success of the Stoke-on-Trent project demonstrates the positive impact that can be achieved when local authorities, charities, and the private sector work together to tackle homelessness. It is hoped that the model can be replicated in other areas to help end the scourge of rough sleeping on our streets.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Box ticking: Dubious benefits of midges and ticks explored,"Box Ticking: Dubious Benefits of Midges and Ticks Explored Despite their often-pesky reputation, midges and ticks play essential roles in various ecosystems. However, their perceived benefits often fail to outweigh the negative impacts they can have on human health and well-being. Midges: A Deceptive Nitrogen Fixer Midges are commonly credited for their contribution to nitrogen fixation in wetlands. However, their role is often overstated and varies widely based on environmental conditions. In some cases, midges may actually contribute to nitrogen release, exacerbating nutrient pollution in sensitive ecosystems. Moreover, their presence can be a nuisance to humans. Their bites are known to cause itchy rashes and skin irritation, and they can be a deterrent to outdoor activities. In some areas, swarms of midges have even led to economic losses in tourism and recreation. Ticks: Disease Vectors with Unproven Medicinal Benefits Ticks are notorious for transmitting diseases to both humans and animals. Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are just a few of the serious conditions they can cause. In the United States alone, tick-borne diseases are estimated to affect over 300,000 people annually. Despite this, there have been claims that certain tick species can have medicinal benefits. However, scientific evidence for these claims is often lacking. While some studies have shown that tick saliva contains compounds with anti-inflammatory properties, the therapeutic value of these compounds is highly questionable. Even if tick saliva does contain beneficial compounds, the risk of contracting serious diseases from tick bites far outweighs any potential health benefits. Limited Ecological Benefits While midges and ticks may serve as food sources for certain animals, their overall ecological importance is often exaggerated. Some bird species, such as swallows and flycatchers, do feed on midges, but these birds have other sources of nutrition as well. Ticks, on the other hand, are primarily parasites that feed on the blood of animals. While they may contribute to host population regulation in some cases, their role is often minimal. Additionally, the diseases they transmit can have devastating effects on wildlife populations. Weighing the Risks and Benefits It is essential to weigh the potential benefits of midges and ticks against their risks to human health and well-being. While these insects may play minor ecological roles, they also pose significant risks to humans and animals. Exaggerating their benefits to justify their presence can be misleading and dangerous. Public health measures should prioritize controlling tick and midge populations to minimize disease risk and improve the quality of life for people living in affected areas.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
G20 summit: Leave your kayak and snake at home,"G20 summit: Leave your kayak and snake at home Leaders from the world's biggest economies are gathering in Indonesia for the G20 summit. But for some attendees, the journey to the meeting has been more eventful than they might have hoped. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was forced to abandon his kayak after it was damaged in rough seas. The incident occurred as Lavrov was paddling from his hotel to the summit venue, accompanied by a security detail. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had a close encounter with a snake while jogging near his hotel. The snake, which was reportedly non-venomous, slithered across Albanese's path, causing him to jump back in surprise. Both incidents have been met with amusement and mockery on social media. Some users have joked that Lavrov should have brought a more seaworthy vessel, while others have suggested that Albanese should stick to running on a treadmill in future. However, the incidents also highlight the logistical challenges of hosting a major international event in a remote location. The G20 summit is being held on the island of Bali, which is not easily accessible by air or sea. As a result, many attendees have had to make long and arduous journeys to reach the venue. Some have even had to charter private planes or boats. The challenges of hosting the G20 summit are a reminder of the importance of careful planning and coordination. The Indonesian government has worked hard to ensure that the event runs smoothly, but there is always the potential for unexpected events to occur. In the meantime, those attending the summit should be prepared for anything. They may not need to bring their kayaks or snakes, but they should be aware that they could encounter some unexpected challenges along the way.

Eurozone manufacturing growth remains 'meagre',"Eurozone Manufacturing Growth Remains 'Meagre' The Eurozone's manufacturing sector continued to show signs of weakness in February, as growth remained ""meagre,"" according to a closely-watched survey. The IHS Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.1 in February, from 50.9 in January. A reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 denotes contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the ""meagre"" growth in February was largely driven by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Eurozone manufacturing output rose at the weakest pace for three months in February as supply chain disruptions and capacity constraints continued to hamper production,"" Williamson said. ""The Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic also weighed on activity, particularly in the consumer-facing sectors."" The survey showed that new orders fell for the first time in three months, while production growth slowed to a three-month low. ""The drop in new orders is a particular concern, as it suggests that the current weakness in manufacturing output could persist in the near term,"" Williamson said. The survey also found that inflationary pressures remained high, with input costs rising at the fastest pace in six months. ""Companies report that supply chain constraints continue to be a major problem, leading to longer lead times and higher prices,"" Williamson said. Despite the challenges, Williamson said that there were some positive signs in the survey. ""The rate of job creation remained robust, and there was evidence of a slight easing in supply chain constraints,"" he said. ""However, with the war in Ukraine creating additional uncertainty, it is too early to say whether these positive signs will be sustained."" The Eurozone economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing supply chain disruptions. The war in Ukraine has added to the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade later this year in an effort to combat rising inflation. However, the bank is also mindful of the risks to economic growth. The latest PMI survey suggests that the Eurozone economy is facing a number of challenges, and that growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Benefit sanctions can cause severe hardship, say MPs","Benefit Sanctions Can Cause Severe Hardship, Say MPs The House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee has published a report on the use of benefit sanctions, finding that they can cause severe hardship for claimants. The report found that sanctions are often imposed for minor or unintentional errors, and that they can lead to people losing their homes, going hungry, and getting into debt. The committee also found that the sanctions system is not always fair, and that it can discriminate against certain groups of people, such as those with mental health problems or disabilities. The report makes a number of recommendations to the government, including: Abolishing the use of sanctions for minor or unintentional errors Introducing a more flexible approach to sanctions, which takes into account individual circumstances Providing more support for claimants who are facing hardship as a result of sanctions The government has said that it will consider the committee's recommendations. The report's findings are based on evidence from a wide range of sources, including claimants, charities, and experts. The committee also visited a number of food banks and homeless shelters to see the impact of sanctions firsthand. The report is a damning indictment of the government's use of benefit sanctions. It is clear that sanctions are causing severe hardship for many claimants, and that the government needs to take action to reform the system. Case Study: Sarah Sarah is a single mother of two young children. She has been claiming benefits for the past year after losing her job. In January, Sarah received a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) informing her that she had been sanctioned for failing to attend a job interview. Sarah had not received the letter inviting her to the interview, and she had no idea that she was supposed to attend. Sarah appealed the decision, but her appeal was unsuccessful. She was told that she would lose her benefits for three months. Sarah was devastated. She had no way to pay her rent or buy food for her children. She was forced to rely on food banks and the generosity of friends and family. Sarah's experience is not unique. Thousands of people across the UK are being sanctioned for minor or unintentional errors. The sanctions system is broken, and it is causing severe hardship for many claimants.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Deepcut soldier Cheryl James' 'rumour' fears,"An investigation has found there was no evidence Cheryl James was murdered, despite rumours circulating online. The 18-year-old soldier was found dead at Deepcut barracks in Surrey in 1995. An inquest in 2002 recorded an open verdict but her family has never accepted that she took her own life. The new inquiry, published on Thursday, found there was ""no credible evidence"" to support any of the rumours that have been circulated about her death. It also found that there was ""no evidence to suggest that Ms James was murdered or unlawfully killed"". The inquiry was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 2020 after a petition calling for a new investigation into Ms James's death reached more than 200,000 signatures. The inquiry was led by former Court of Appeal judge Sir Nicholas Blake. In his report, Sir Nicholas said that he had ""carefully considered all of the evidence"" and had ""found no credible evidence to support any of the rumours that have been circulated about Ms James's death"". He added that he had ""found no evidence to suggest that Ms James was murdered or unlawfully killed"". Sir Nicholas said that he understood that Ms James's family ""may not agree with my conclusions"" but he hoped that they would ""find some comfort in knowing that I have conducted a thorough and impartial investigation"". Ms James's mother, Doreen Lawrence, said that she was ""disappointed"" by the findings of the inquiry. She said that she still believed that her daughter was murdered and that she would continue to fight for justice. The MoD said that it was ""deeply sorry"" for the loss of Ms James and for the pain that her family had suffered. It said that it accepted the findings of the inquiry and that it would ""continue to work to ensure that the welfare of our personnel is protected"". The inquiry's findings are likely to bring to an end the long-running campaign for a new investigation into Ms James's death. However, her family has said that they will continue to fight for justice.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Concorde group meets British Airways over museum bid,"The Concorde group, which is campaigning to preserve the last remaining Concorde aircraft in the UK, has met with British Airways (BA) to discuss a possible bid for the aircraft. The group, which includes former Concorde pilots and engineers, wants to see the aircraft preserved at a museum in the UK. BA is currently the owner of the aircraft, which is currently in storage at Heathrow Airport. The meeting was described as ""positive"" by both sides. The Concorde group said that BA was ""very receptive"" to the idea of a museum bid. BA said that it was ""open to discussions"" about the future of the aircraft. The Concorde group is now working on putting together a formal bid for the aircraft. The group hopes to raise £20 million to purchase the aircraft and to establish a museum. The Concorde was a supersonic passenger jet that was operated by BA and Air France from 1976 to 2003. The aircraft was capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. Only 20 Concordes were ever built. The last Concorde to fly was G-BOAF, which is now in storage at Heathrow Airport. The aircraft was retired in 2003 after a fatal accident in Paris. The Concorde group believes that G-BOAF is an important part of British aviation history. The group wants to see the aircraft preserved so that future generations can learn about the Concorde's history and legacy. BA said that it was ""proud"" of the Concorde's legacy. The airline said that it was ""committed to working with the Concorde group to find a suitable solution for the future of the aircraft."" The Concorde group is hopeful that it will be able to reach an agreement with BA to purchase G-BOAF. The group believes that a museum dedicated to the Concorde would be a fitting tribute to the aircraft's legacy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Stain-shedding coating gets tough,"Stain-shedding Coating Gets Tough Scientists have developed a new stain-shedding coating inspired by the slippery surface of pitcher plants. The coating is durable and can be applied to a variety of surfaces, making them resistant to stains from coffee, red wine, and even permanent markers. The coating is made from a polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is commonly used in contact lenses and medical implants. The PDMS is coated with a layer of fluorinated molecules, which are known for their water- and oil-repellent properties. The resulting coating is both hydrophobic and oleophobic, meaning that it repels both water and oil. This makes it highly resistant to stains, as most stains are either water-based or oil-based. To test the coating's durability, the researchers applied it to a variety of surfaces, including glass, metal, plastic, and fabric. The coated surfaces were then exposed to a variety of stains, including coffee, red wine, and permanent markers. The coating was found to be effective at repelling all of the stains, even after multiple applications. The researchers also tested the coating's durability by scratching it with a razor blade. The coating was able to withstand the scratching without losing its stain-repellent properties. The new coating has a wide range of potential applications, including in the food and beverage industry, the healthcare industry, and the textile industry. It could be used to create stain-resistant clothing, tablecloths, and other fabrics. It could also be used to create stain-resistant surfaces in kitchens, bathrooms, and hospitals. The researchers believe that the new coating could have a significant impact on the way we clean and protect our belongings. They are currently working to develop a commercial version of the coating that can be easily applied to a variety of surfaces. In addition to its stain-repellent properties, the coating is also transparent, flexible, and non-toxic. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications where a clear, durable coating is required. The researchers believe that the new coating could revolutionize the way we protect our belongings from stains. They are excited to see how the coating can be used to create new products and improve existing ones.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
G4S used force on pregnant woman at Cedars centre,"G4S denies using force on pregnant woman at Cedars centre _By BBC News_ Security firm G4S has denied using force on a pregnant woman at the Cedars centre in Birmingham. The woman, who is in her 30s, was taken to hospital after she was allegedly pinned down by security guards at the centre on Friday. She claimed she was seven months pregnant at the time and that the incident had caused her to lose her baby. However, G4S said the woman was not pregnant and that she had been ""aggressive and abusive"" towards staff. The incident happened at around 10am on Friday when the woman was trying to leave the centre. She told the BBC she had been to the centre to visit a friend and that when she tried to leave, she was stopped by security guards. She said she was then pinned down by three guards and that one of them put his knee on her stomach. ""I was screaming and crying and telling them I was pregnant,"" she said. ""But they didn't listen. They just kept pinning me down."" She said she was eventually taken to hospital, where she was treated for a suspected miscarriage. However, G4S said the woman was not pregnant and that she had been ""aggressive and abusive"" towards staff. A spokesman for the company said: ""We can confirm that an incident took place at the Cedars centre on Friday involving a female who was attempting to leave the premises.

Kingfisher to hand back £23m of UK furlough cash,"Amidst the financial turmoil brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, Kingfishers' decision to return £23 million of UK furlough cash stands out as a beacon of corporate responsibility. The home improvement retailer has demonstrated a commitment to fairness and transparency by recognizing that the taxpayer funds designed to support struggling businesses should be used for their intended purpose. Kingfisher's decision is a testament to the fact that even in times of economic hardship, companies have a moral obligation to act ethically. By voluntarily returning funds that were not essential to their survival, Kingfisher has sent a powerful message that businesses must prioritize their long-term values over short-term gains. This move is particularly significant given the widespread criticism of companies that abused the furlough scheme. Some businesses were accused of claiming funds despite making significant profits, while others used the scheme to prop up failing enterprises that were unlikely to recover. Kingfisher's decision to return the funds sends a clear signal that such practices are unacceptable. The company's action has also been met with praise from government officials. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has welcomed the move, stating that it is a ""positive example of businesses doing the right thing."" This sentiment has been echoed by Treasury Chief Secretary Steve Barclay, who commended Kingfisher's ""sense of responsibility."" Moreover, Kingfisher's decision is likely to have a positive impact on its reputation among customers and investors. By demonstrating its commitment to ethical behavior, the company has shown that it is a responsible corporate citizen that values integrity and transparency. This can lead to increased trust and loyalty among its stakeholders, which can ultimately benefit the company's bottom line. In conclusion, Kingfisher's decision to return £23 million of UK furlough cash is a commendable example of corporate responsibility. The company has recognized the importance of using public funds for their intended purpose, and it has set a high standard of ethical behavior for other businesses to follow. Kingfisher's actions have been met with praise from government officials and stakeholders alike, and they are likely to have a positive impact on the company's reputation and long-term success.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Dale Farm: Basildon Council considering further action,"Dale Farm: Basildon Council considering further action Basildon Council is considering further action against the illegal Dale Farm travellers' site after a High Court judge rejected an appeal by the residents to halt their eviction. The council had been granted possession of the site in Essex in 2011, but the residents had been appealing against the decision ever since. Mr Justice Holgate ruled on Monday that the council could proceed with its plans to evict the residents, who have been living on the site for more than a decade. The council said it was ""pleased"" with the ruling and that it would now ""consider its next steps"". ""We will be working closely with the police and other agencies to ensure that the eviction is carried out safely and humanely,"" a council spokesman said. The residents of Dale Farm have said they will continue to fight the eviction. ""We are not going to give up,"" said Mary Sheridan, a Dale Farm resident. ""We have been here for 10 years and we are not going to let them throw us out."" The Dale Farm site has been the subject of a long-running legal battle. In 2011, the council was granted possession of the site, but the residents appealed against the decision. In 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the council could not evict the residents without providing them with alternative accommodation. However, the Supreme Court overturned that decision in 2015, ruling that the council could evict the residents without providing them with alternative accommodation. The residents have now exhausted all their legal options and the council is free to evict them. The council has said that it will provide the residents with ""reasonable assistance"" to help them move off the site. However, the residents have said that they will not accept any help from the council and that they will stay on the site until they are forcibly evicted. The eviction of Dale Farm is expected to be a complex and costly operation. The council has estimated that it will cost around £18m to evict the residents and clear the site. The eviction is also likely to be met with resistance from the residents. In 2011, there were violent clashes between police and residents when the council attempted to evict them. The council has said that it is ""committed to working with the police and other agencies to ensure that the eviction is carried out safely and humanely"".",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Twitch: Streamers call for a blackout to recognise victims of sexual and racial abuses,"Twitch, the popular streaming platform, is facing a wave of criticism, with streamers calling for a blackout to protest the company's handling of sexual and racial abuse on its platform. The outcry comes after a series of high-profile incidents, including the alleged sexual assault of a streamer by another streamer, and the use of racial slurs by a popular streamer. Streamers have accused Twitch of failing to adequately address these incidents, and of creating a culture that tolerates abuse. One streamer, who goes by the name ItsHafu, said: ""Twitch has failed its streamers, and it's time for us to take a stand."" ""We're not going to be silent while our community is being harassed and abused,"" she added. The blackout is set to take place on September 1st, and will last for 24 hours. During that time, streamers will refrain from streaming on Twitch, as a way of sending a message to the company. Twitch has said that it is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for its streamers and viewers. ""We do not tolerate any form of abuse on our platform,"" a Twitch spokesperson said. ""We are constantly working to improve our policies and procedures to ensure that Twitch is a place where everyone feels safe and respected."" However, streamers have said that Twitch's actions have not gone far enough. ""Twitch needs to do more than just issue statements,"" said another streamer, who goes by the name Pokimane. ""They need to take concrete steps to address the underlying culture of abuse on the platform."" The blackout is expected to be a major test for Twitch. If it is successful, it could force the company to take more aggressive action to address the issue of abuse on its platform. However, it is also possible that the blackout will have little impact on Twitch. The company has a large and loyal user base, and it is not clear how many streamers will be willing to participate in the blackout. Regardless of its impact, the blackout is a clear sign that streamers are fed up with the way that Twitch has handled the issue of abuse on its platform. It remains to be seen whether Twitch will be able to address the concerns of its streamers and create a more inclusive and safe environment for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sir Keir Starmer: Labour has 'duty' to tackle anti-Semitism,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his party has a ""duty"" to tackle anti-Semitism, following a damning report into the issue. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that the party was responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Sir Keir apologized for the hurt caused and said the party would ""change and improve."" He said: ""We have a duty to tackle anti-Semitism wherever it occurs, and to do so robustly and urgently."" The EHRC report found that the Labour Party had a ""culture of deference"" to former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of tolerating anti-Semitism. The report also found that the party had failed to deal with complaints of anti-Semitism promptly and effectively. Sir Keir said that he accepted the findings of the report and that the party would implement all of its recommendations. He said: ""I am determined to build a Labour Party that is welcoming and inclusive for all."" The EHRC report is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Labour Party, which has been embroiled in a long-running row over anti-Semitism. In 2019, the party was suspended from the international body that represents social democratic parties. And in 2020, the former Labour MP Luciana Berger quit the party, accusing it of being ""institutionally anti-Semitic."" Sir Keir's apology and commitment to tackling anti-Semitism has been welcomed by some Jewish groups. The Jewish Labour Movement said: ""We welcome Sir Keir Starmer's unequivocal apology and commitment to tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party."" But other groups have said that the party needs to do more to demonstrate that it is serious about tackling the issue. The Campaign Against Antisemitism said: ""Sir Keir Starmer's apology is a welcome first step, but it must be followed by real action to root out the anti-Semitism that has taken hold in the Labour Party."" The Labour Party is now facing a legal challenge over its handling of anti-Semitism. A group of Jewish former Labour MPs and party members is suing the party, alleging that it has failed to tackle anti-Semitism effectively. The case is due to be heard in the High Court later this year.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Should we lose civil liberties for national security?,"In the aftermath of terrorist attacks and other national crises, it's tempting to trade away some personal freedoms in the name of safety. But does sacrificing civil liberties truly enhance national security? Proponents of such measures argue that increased surveillance, restrictions on political speech, and the suspension of due process are necessary to prevent future attacks. They point to the Patriot Act, passed after the 9/11 attacks, as an example of successful legislation that has helped thwart potential threats. However, critics contend that such measures can have unintended consequences. Mass surveillance can stifle dissent and create a climate of fear. By chilling free speech, governments can prevent individuals from speaking out against oppressive policies or expressing unpopular opinions. Furthermore, the suspension of due process can lead to wrongful convictions and erode trust in the justice system. When individuals are detained indefinitely without charge or access to legal counsel, the fundamental right to a fair trial is compromised. It is also worth considering the potential long-term effects of eroding civil liberties. Once lost, these freedoms can be difficult to regain. The slippery slope argument suggests that once one liberty is sacrificed, the door is opened to further encroachments on personal rights. For example, the Espionage Act of 1917, which criminalized anti-war speech during World War I, was later used to suppress political dissent. Similarly, the Smith Act of 1940, which targeted communists and other radicals, was later used to prosecute civil rights activists. Moreover, the balance between security and liberty is a delicate one. While it is certainly important to protect citizens from harm, excessive sacrifices of civil liberties can undermine the very values that make a society free and democratic. As former President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, ""In times of national emergency, the public must beware of the danger of hysterical demands for legislation to curb the rights of American citizens."" It is essential to find a balance that does not compromise the basic freedoms that underpin a democratic society. This means implementing effective security measures while safeguarding civil liberties. Instead of eroding personal rights, governments should focus on addressing the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice. By investing in education, opportunity, and diplomacy, we can create a more just and peaceful world that is less susceptible to the lure of extremism. Ultimately, the question of whether we should lose civil liberties for national security is a complex one with no easy answers. It requires a careful weighing of the potential risks and benefits and a recognition that the preservation of both security and liberty are essential for a thriving society.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Open prison Hollesley Bay has 'quarter of inmates' infected,"Covid-19: Open prison Hollesley Bay has 'quarter of inmates' infected A quarter of inmates at an open prison in Suffolk have tested positive for Covid-19, the BBC understands. Hollesley Bay prison, near Woodbridge, holds about 100 male prisoners in open conditions. The Prison Service said 25 prisoners and seven staff have tested positive. They are all in self-isolation. It is understood about 25 prisoners have tested positive in the past week and the first case was reported on 22 December. The open prison system allows inmates to work and take part in education outside the prison walls during the day, but they must return to their cells at night. Inmates can also apply to go on temporary release to visit family or friends, or to attend medical appointments. One prison source told the BBC they believe the outbreak began with an inmate who had been on temporary release and attended a large family event. The Prison Service said the prison was working closely with Public Health England to manage the outbreak. ""All appropriate measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the virus,"" it said. ""This includes enhanced cleaning regimes, the provision of PPE and social distancing measures."" The prison service has already taken steps to limit the spread of the virus, including reducing the number of prisoners who can go out to work or take part in education. It has also stopped all visits to the prison and is not allowing any new prisoners to be admitted. The outbreak at Hollesley Bay is the latest in a series of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons in England and Wales. In October, more than 100 prisoners at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham tested positive for Covid-19.

How Perrie from Little Mix is helping me learn to love my freckles,"Perrie Edwards, a member of the iconic girl group Little Mix, has become an unexpected role model for me in terms of self-love and body acceptance. Her unapologetic embrace of her freckles has inspired me to challenge societal beauty standards and appreciate the unique features that make me who I am. Growing up, I was constantly teased for having freckles. I felt like an outsider, convinced that my appearance was somehow flawed. I tried to cover them up with makeup, hoping to conform to the narrow definition of beauty that was constantly reinforced in the media. However, Perrie's confidence in her own skin has shattered these preconceived notions. Her freckles are not something to be hidden or ashamed of; rather, they are a beautiful part of her identity. Seeing her flaunt them with pride has given me the courage to do the same. The first time I went out in public without makeup, it felt like a major victory. I had spent so many years hiding behind a mask, and now I was finally ready to show the world who I truly was. The reaction I received was overwhelmingly positive. Friends and strangers alike complimented me on my freckles, telling me how they made me look unique and beautiful. Embracing my freckles has been a transformative experience. It has not only boosted my self-esteem but has also given me a newfound sense of authenticity. I no longer feel the need to conform to unrealistic beauty ideals. I am proud of who I am, both inside and out. Perrie's influence extends beyond just her freckles. She is also an advocate for body positivity, promoting a healthy and accepting attitude towards all body types. Seeing her use her platform to challenge body shaming and promote self-love has inspired me to do the same. In an industry that often objectifies women, Perrie is a refreshing and much-needed voice. She reminds us that true beauty lies not in conforming to societal expectations, but in embracing our own individuality and celebrating the things that make us unique. As I navigate the complexities of adulthood, Perrie Edwards continues to be a guiding light. Her unwavering self-acceptance has taught me the importance of loving myself unconditionally.

UK tax evasion action hunt identifies 100 individuals,"UK Tax Evasion Action Hunt Identifies 100 Individuals A major tax evasion crackdown by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has identified 100 individuals suspected of hiding millions of pounds offshore. The operation, codenamed ""Project Lantana,"" involved investigators working with international tax authorities to uncover complex financial structures used to conceal wealth abroad. The individuals under investigation are believed to have hidden assets in countries such as Switzerland, Monaco, and the British Virgin Islands. HMRC said the suspected tax evasion amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds. The agency has frozen assets, seized property, and launched criminal investigations. ""This is a significant blow to tax evasion in the UK,"" said HMRC Director General Jim Harra. ""We will not tolerate those who hide their wealth offshore to avoid paying their fair share of tax."" The investigation was sparked by the Panama Papers leak in 2016, which revealed how wealthy individuals and companies used offshore companies to avoid taxes. HMRC has since invested heavily in new technology and data analysis capabilities to identify and pursue suspected tax evaders. The individuals under investigation come from a variety of backgrounds, including business owners, celebrities, and high-net-worth individuals. They are accused of using offshore structures to hide income, assets, and profits from HMRC. HMRC said it is working closely with the National Crime Agency and other law enforcement partners to tackle tax evasion. The agency has also called on the public to report any suspected tax fraud. ""Tax evasion is a serious crime that deprives vital public services of funding,"" said Harra. ""We urge anyone with information about tax fraud to come forward."" The operation is part of HMRC's ongoing efforts to crack down on tax evasion and avoidance. In recent years, the agency has recovered billions of pounds in unpaid taxes. The government has also introduced a number of measures to deter tax evasion, including the introduction of a ""strict liability"" offense for failing to declare offshore income. However, tax evasion remains a problem in the UK. The Tax Justice Network estimates that the UK loses around £35 billion a year to tax evasion. HMRC's crackdown on tax evasion is a welcome step towards tackling this problem. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to close the loopholes that allow individuals to hide their wealth offshore.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
How did it go so wrong for Govia Thameslink?,"How did it go so wrong for Govia Thameslink? Govia Thameslink (GTR), the operator of Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern rail services, has been under fire in recent months for its poor performance. The company has been plagued by delays, cancellations, and overcrowding, leading to widespread anger among passengers. So, what went wrong? There are a number of factors that have contributed to GTR's problems. One is the sheer complexity of the network that it operates. Thameslink is one of the busiest rail routes in the UK, and it is also one of the most complex. The route runs through central London and connects a number of major cities, including Brighton, Cambridge, and Peterborough. This complexity makes it difficult to operate the service efficiently, and it is easy for delays to occur. Another factor that has contributed to GTR's problems is the lack of investment in the network. The Thameslink route has been neglected for many years, and this has led to a number of problems. The tracks are in poor condition, the trains are old and unreliable, and the signalling system is outdated. This lack of investment has made it difficult for GTR to operate the service efficiently. Finally, GTR has been criticized for its poor customer service. The company has been slow to respond to complaints, and it has often been difficult for passengers to get information about delays and cancellations. This has led to a great deal of frustration among passengers, and it has damaged GTR's reputation. The combination of these factors has led to a downward spiral for GTR. The company's performance has continued to deteriorate, and乘客满意度has plummeted. GTR is now facing a number of challenges, including a potential fine from the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The ORR is currently investigating GTR's performance, and it is expected to publish its findings later this year. The ORR could impose a fine of up to £10 million on GTR if it finds that the company has breached its licence conditions. In addition to the ORR investigation, GTR is also facing a number of legal challenges from passengers. A group of passengers has launched a class action lawsuit against GTR, alleging that the company has breached its contract with them. The lawsuit is seeking damages for the delays and cancellations that passengers have experienced. GTR is facing a number of challenges, and it is unclear whether the company will be able to overcome them. The ORR investigation and the legal challenges could lead to significant financial penalties for GTR, and the company's reputation has been damaged. It remains to be seen whether GTR can turn things around and improve its performance.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Portland homes evacuated as sirens sound for first time,"Residents in Portland, Oregon, have been evacuated from their homes as sirens sounded for the first time in decades, warning of an imminent threat to the city. The sirens, which were installed in the 1950s to warn of an air raid, were activated just before 7am on Wednesday morning. City officials have urged people in the affected areas to take shelter immediately. The exact nature of the threat is not yet known, but local media are reporting that there is a large fire in the city's industrial district. The fire is said to be spreading rapidly, and there are concerns that it could spread to residential areas. Portland Fire & Rescue is currently battling the blaze, and has requested assistance from neighboring fire departments. The extent of the damage is not yet known, but the fire is believed to have caused significant damage to several buildings. The evacuation order is currently in effect for the following areas: The Pearl District The Old Town Chinatown The Lloyd District The Central Eastside Industrial District Residents in these areas are advised to leave their homes immediately and seek shelter in a safe location. The city has set up several emergency shelters, which can be found at the following locations: The Oregon Convention Center The Moda Center The Portland Expo Center The city is urging residents to stay informed about the situation by monitoring local news and social media. The city's website also has up-to-date information on the fire and evacuation order. The activation of the sirens is a rare event in Portland. The last time the sirens were sounded was in 1980, when there was a major earthquake in the Pacific Northwest. The city has been preparing for the possibility of a major disaster for several years. In 2016, the city adopted a new emergency management plan, which includes a provision for sounding the sirens in the event of an imminent threat. The city is also working to improve its communication systems, so that residents can be quickly notified of any emergencies. The city is urging residents to sign up for the city's emergency alert system, which can be found at the city's website.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Are these north Wales hills sitting on a gold mine?,"Nestled amidst the breathtaking landscape of north Wales, the rugged hills of Bwlchgwyn and Cefn Mawr have long held a tantalizing secret - the potential to harbor vast reserves of gold. Recent exploration by mining company Alba Mineral Resources has ignited excitement among geologists and investors alike, raising the tantalizing prospect that these hills could be sitting on a gold mine. Historical records hint at the presence of gold in the area dating back to Roman times. However, it was not until the 19th century that serious exploration began. In the 1860s, a gold rush gripped the region, attracting miners from far and wide. While some small-scale mining operations did uncover some gold, the veins proved to be narrow and inconsistent, leading to the eventual decline of the rush. Fast forward to the present day, and Alba Mineral Resources has embarked on a renewed exploration campaign using cutting-edge technology. Their focus is on a potentially large gold deposit that lies deep beneath the hills, known as the Bwlchgwyn Gold Project. Through extensive drilling and core sampling, Alba has identified several gold-bearing zones. The most significant of these is the Central Zone, which has shown consistently high gold grades over a substantial area. Further drilling is underway to delineate the full extent of this zone and to estimate the potential size and value of the deposit. ""The results we've seen so far are very encouraging,"" said Alba's exploration manager, Dr. Mark Jones. ""We're excited about the potential of this project to deliver a significant new gold resource for Wales."" The company's exploration activities have sparked interest from the wider mining industry and the financial community. Investors are keen to get involved in what could potentially be a lucrative investment opportunity. However, it is important to note that exploration is still ongoing, and there is no guarantee that the Bwlchgwyn Gold Project will ultimately prove to be economically viable. Further drilling and analysis are required to fully understand the size and quality of the deposit. Furthermore, the project would require significant investment and infrastructure to develop. Environmental considerations and local community engagement will also be key factors in determining the future of the project. Despite these uncertainties, the potential rewards of the Bwlchgwyn Gold Project are undeniably tantalizing. If Alba's exploration efforts prove successful, it could transform the area, bringing economic benefits and creating new jobs. It could also establish north Wales as a significant player in the global gold mining industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
India mango farmers angry at dump plan,"In the verdant heart of India's mango-producing belt, a storm of anger is brewing among farmers over the government's plans to dump thousands of tonnes of imported Alphonso mangoes. The move, intended to ease dwindling domestic supplies and cool soaring prices, has sent shockwaves through a community that relies heavily on the fruit for their livelihoods. Farmers fear the influx of foreign mangoes will flood the market, driving down prices and potentially ruining their businesses. ""This is a death knell for mango farmers,"" said Sanjay Jadhav, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. ""Why import mangoes when our own farmers are struggling?"" The government's decision stems from a shortfall in domestic production this year due to unfavourable weather conditions. To address the gap, it granted permission to import 20,000 tonnes of Alphonso mangoes from the neighbouring country of Pakistan. However, farmers argue that the imported mangoes will not only harm their livelihoods but also compromise the reputation of Indian Alphonso mangoes, renowned worldwide for their sweet and juicy flavour. ""Pakistan produces different varieties of Alphonso mangoes,"" said Satish Patwari, a farmer from the Alphonso-growing district of Ratnagiri. ""Mixing them with our own mangoes will damage the brand and reduce consumer confidence."" The farmers' concerns are echoed by industry experts, who warn that the import plan could disrupt the delicate balance of the mango market. ""The government should have explored alternative options, such as increasing domestic production or importing from other countries with similar mango varieties,"" said Parag Parikh, an agricultural economist. The government, for its part, insists that the import move is a temporary measure to ensure adequate supply and prevent price spikes. It has promised to provide compensation to farmers affected by the decision. But for the mango farmers of India, the government's assurances ring hollow. They demand a reversal of the import decision and a long-term plan to support domestic mango production. ""We are not asking for handouts,"" said Jadhav. ""We want the government to create a supportive environment where mango farmers can thrive and continue to produce the best mangoes in the world."" As the mango season approaches its peak, the battle between India's mango farmers and the government continues to simmer, threatening the livelihoods of thousands and the reputation of an iconic fruit.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Ari Fuld killing: $1m raised for family by crowdfunders,"In a remarkable display of global solidarity, over $1 million has been raised for the family of Ari Fuld, an Israeli-American father of four who was brutally murdered in a terrorist attack in the West Bank on Sunday. The outpouring of support has been driven by a crowdfunding campaign launched by Fuld's friends in the US, which has seen donations pour in from around the world. Fuld, a 45-year-old dual US-Israeli citizen, was stabbed to death while driving his car near the Jewish settlement of Efrat. The attack was claimed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which hailed Fuld's killing as a ""heroic operation"" against Israeli settlers. The crowdfunding campaign, hosted on the GoFundMe platform, was set up by Fuld's close friend, Rabbi Yaakov Menken. The initial goal was to raise $500,000 to support Fuld's wife and four young children, but that target was quickly surpassed. As of Tuesday morning, the campaign had raised over $1.1 million, with donations coming from more than 14,000 people from 50 countries. In a statement posted on the GoFundMe page, Rabbi Menken thanked the global community for their ""overwhelming outpouring of love and support."" He said that the money raised would help Fuld's family ""during this incredibly difficult time"" and allow them to focus on rebuilding their lives. ""Ari was a true hero who dedicated his life to protecting Israel and its people,"" Rabbi Menken wrote. ""His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and the impact he had on the world."" The killing of Ari Fuld has been widely condemned by world leaders, including US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump called the attack a ""horrific act of terrorism"" and vowed to stand with Israel in the fight against terrorism. Netanyahu vowed to ""bring the despicable murderers to justice"" and said that Fuld's death would not be in vain. The crowdfunding campaign for Ari Fuld's family has been praised as a powerful example of how people from around the world can come together in the face of tragedy. It is a testament to the deep bonds of friendship and solidarity that unite people across borders and religious divides.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Covid: Wales-wide lockdown questioned by Tories,"The Welsh government's decision to impose a Wales-wide lockdown has been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives, who have called for a more targeted approach. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced on Friday that Wales would enter a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown from 6pm on Friday 23 October, amid rising Covid-19 cases. The lockdown will see schools, non-essential shops and hospitality businesses close, and people will be advised to stay at home as much as possible. But Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies said the lockdown was a ""blunt instrument"" that would ""do more harm than good"". He said the government should have considered a more targeted approach, such as localised lockdowns in areas with high levels of Covid-19 cases.

Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits,"In a surprising move, transportation giant Uber has announced the sale of its self-driving car unit to Aurora Innovation, a leading autonomous vehicle technology company. This decision marks a significant shift in Uber's strategy as it pivots its focus towards profitability and core ride-hailing services. Uber's self-driving car program has been in development for several years, with a substantial investment of time and resources. However, despite early promises and successful demonstration projects, the company has faced challenges in bringing its autonomous vehicles to commercial operation. The technical and regulatory hurdles proved more complex and time-consuming than initially anticipated. Moreover, Uber's self-driving car ambitions have faced financial constraints. The unit has consistently operated at a loss, and recent market conditions have made it difficult for the company to justify continued investment in a venture that is not yet generating revenue. By selling its self-driving car unit, Uber is acknowledging the challenges involved in bringing autonomous vehicles to market. Instead, it will focus on its core ride-hailing business, which has proven to be a profitable and growing segment. Uber's decision to prioritize profitability is not unexpected in the current economic climate. The company has recently made several cost-cutting moves, including layoffs and the sale of non-core assets. By divesting its self-driving car unit, Uber can free up capital and resources to invest in its core business and improve its financial performance. Aurora Innovation, the buyer of Uber's self-driving car unit, is a well-funded and experienced player in the autonomous vehicle industry. The company has a strong track record in developing and testing self-driving technologies and has partnerships with major automakers such as Toyota and Hyundai. The acquisition of Uber's self-driving car unit will boost Aurora Innovation's capabilities and accelerate its progress towards commercializing autonomous vehicles. Aurora will gain access to Uber's extensive data, software, and hardware, as well as a team of experienced engineers and scientists. While Uber's decision to sell its self-driving car unit may disappoint some, it is a pragmatic move that reflects the challenges and uncertainties of the autonomous vehicle industry. Uber's prioritization of profitability and focus on its core ride-hailing business will ensure its long-term sustainability and success.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Does Labour have an 'Ed Miliband problem'?,"Labour's leadership contest has reached its final stages, with the party membership set to vote on their next leader. The frontrunner in the race is Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who is seen as the most electable candidate. However, his main rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, is seen as the candidate most likely to unite the party. One of the key issues in the contest has been the legacy of Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader who lost the 2015 general election. Miliband was a divisive figure, and his leadership is seen by some as one of the reasons for Labour's defeat. Starmer has sought to distance himself from Miliband's legacy, while Long-Bailey has embraced it. She has said that she wants to ""finish the job"" that Miliband started, and she has promised to continue his policies on issues such as austerity and inequality. Some commentators believe that Labour's defeat in 2015 was due to Miliband's unpopularity, and that the party needs to move away from his legacy in order to win back voters. Others argue that Miliband was a victim of circumstances, and that the party should not abandon his policies. The issue of Miliband's legacy is likely to continue to be a major talking point in the Labour leadership contest. It is a question that the party will need to answer if it wants to win the next general election. A recent poll by YouGov found that 42% of Labour members believe that Miliband was a good leader, while 38% believe that he was a bad leader. The poll also found that 52% of Labour members believe that the party should move away from Miliband's legacy, while 33% believe that it should continue his policies. These findings suggest that there is no clear consensus among Labour members on Miliband's legacy. It is an issue that is likely to continue to be debated in the run-up to the party's leadership election. The Labour leadership contest is a crucial moment for the party. The party is at a crossroads, and it needs to decide which direction it wants to go in. The issue of Miliband's legacy is a key part of that decision.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Ring of Peace: Iconic Belfast mural 'speaks' with 'advertising' addition,"Amidst the bustling streets of Belfast, where history and modernity intertwine, the iconic Ring of Peace mural has witnessed another chapter in its storied existence. This time, it has found an unlikely ally in the realm of advertising, giving rise to a unique and thought-provoking collaboration. The Ring of Peace mural, created in 1995 by artist Colin Davidson, is a poignant symbol of Belfast's troubled past and its subsequent journey towards peace. Depicting a series of hands interlocked, the mural has become a beacon of hope and reconciliation in a city scarred by conflict. However, in a recent twist, the mural has been incorporated into an advertising campaign for 'Aeon', a new men's fragrance. The campaign features a large-scale projection of the fragrance's logo onto the mural, alongside the slogan ""Unite the Senses."" The juxtaposition of an advertising message with the deeply symbolic mural has sparked a heated debate among Belfast residents and beyond. Some have hailed the collaboration as a creative and innovative way to engage with the city's history, while others have expressed concerns about the potential commercialization of such a significant landmark. Supporters of the campaign argue that it provides a contemporary interpretation of the mural's message of unity and peace. By incorporating the mural into the advertising, they believe, the campaign helps to spread its message to a wider audience. Furthermore, they contend that the revenue generated could potentially be used to fund local community initiatives. Detractors, on the other hand, worry that the advertising projection detracts from the mural's authenticity and historical significance. They argue that the commercialization of such a sacred space disrespects the victims of the conflict and undermines the mural's message of reconciliation. The debate over the Ring of Peace mural and its advertising addition highlights the complex and evolving nature of Belfast's relationship with its past. As the city continues to heal and move forward, it must strike a delicate balance between commemorating its history and embracing new forms of expression. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether the advertising projection enhances or diminishes the impact of the Ring of Peace mural. Regardless of one's stance, the collaboration serves as a reminder that even the most deeply embedded symbols can be reinterpreted and recontextualized over time.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Delay for Nasa's Tess planet-hunter,"NASA's TESS Planet-Hunter Mission Delayed NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has been delayed by a technical issue, the space agency announced on Friday. The launch, which was originally scheduled for March 5, has been postponed indefinitely until the problem can be resolved. The issue is with the spacecraft's propulsion system. During a routine test, engineers discovered a leak in one of the thrusters that is used to control the satellite's orientation. NASA is currently working to identify and fix the leak, but it is unclear how long this will take. ""We are disappointed to have to delay the launch of TESS, but we are committed to ensuring that the mission is a success,"" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's Astrophysics Division. ""We will take the time necessary to resolve this issue and ensure that the spacecraft is ready to begin its mission to discover new exoplanets."" TESS is designed to survey the entire sky for exoplanets, or planets that orbit stars other than the Sun. The mission will use a wide-field camera to search for planets that transit, or pass in front of, their host stars. By measuring the dips in brightness caused by these transits, astronomers can determine the size, mass, and orbit of the planets. TESS is expected to discover thousands of new exoplanets, including many that are potentially habitable for life. The mission will also help astronomers to better understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The delay in TESS's launch is a setback for NASA, but it is not expected to have a major impact on the mission's overall goals. The spacecraft is still expected to be fully operational by the end of 2018, and it will have a two-year primary mission to survey the entire sky.

"Shark kills number 100 million annually, research says","Shark Kills Number 100 Million Annually, Research Says A new study has revealed that sharks kill an estimated 100 million animals annually, making them one of the deadliest predators on the planet. The research, published in the journal Nature, analyzed data from over 500 scientific studies to estimate the number of animals killed by sharks each year. The study found that sharks kill a wide range of animals, including fish, seals, sea turtles, and even other sharks. The researchers estimate that sharks kill approximately 63 million fish, 27 million seals, 10 million sea turtles, and 1 million other sharks each year. The researchers also found that the number of animals killed by sharks is increasing each year. This is likely due to a number of factors, including climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Climate change is causing the oceans to warm, which is forcing sharks to move into new areas. This increased competition for food and habitat is leading to more shark attacks on other animals. Overfishing is also a major threat to sharks. Sharks are often caught as bycatch in fishing nets, and this can lead to their deaths. In addition, overfishing is reducing the number of prey available to sharks, which can also lead to increased shark attacks on other animals. Pollution is another major threat to sharks. Sharks are often exposed to harmful chemicals, such as mercury and PCBs. These chemicals can damage sharks' immune systems and make them more susceptible to disease. The researchers say that the increasing number of shark kills is a cause for concern. They say that sharks play an important role in the marine ecosystem, and their loss could have a ripple effect on other animals. The researchers say that more research is needed to understand the factors that are driving the increase in shark kills. They also say that steps need to be taken to protect sharks and their habitat. One way to protect sharks is to reduce the amount of fishing that occurs in their habitats. Another way to protect sharks is to reduce pollution. The researchers say that by taking these steps, we can help to ensure that sharks continue to play an important role in the marine ecosystem for generations to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The most common scam in Northern Ireland was the 'suckers list', which involves fraudsters sending out an email or text message offering a high-value item or service at a very low price. The victim is then asked to pay upfront, but the item or service never arrives. Other common scams include: Advance fee fraud: fraudsters ask for money upfront for a service or product that never materialises. Identity theft: fraudsters steal personal information, such as your name, address and bank details, to commit fraud in your name. Phishing: fraudsters send out emails or text messages that look like they are from a legitimate organisation, such as your bank, in order to trick you into revealing personal information. Telephone preference service (TPS) fraud: fraudsters call people who are registered with the TPS, offering to remove them from the list for a fee. The CMA said that the total amount lost to scams in the UK was £1.3bn over the four years from 2017 to 2020. The CMA's chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""Scams can have a devastating impact on victims, both financially and emotionally. We are determined to crack down on these criminals and protect consumers from harm."" The CMA has urged people to be vigilant and to be aware of the warning signs of a scam. These include: Being asked to pay upfront for a service or product that you have not yet received. Being asked to provide personal information, such as your bank details, over the phone or email. Being pressured to make a decision quickly. Being offered a deal that seems too good to be true. If you think you have been the victim of a scam, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Driverless cars 'to increase congestion' says government,"Driverless cars 'to increase congestion' says government The government has warned that driverless cars could lead to increased congestion on the roads. A new report by the Department for Transport (DfT) suggests that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles could lead to a rise in traffic levels as people become more reliant on them. The report says that driverless cars could make journeys more convenient, but they could also lead to more people choosing to travel by car, rather than using public transport or walking. This could lead to a significant increase in congestion, particularly in urban areas. The DfT report also warns that driverless cars could make it more difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. The report says that the government is committed to working with the automotive industry to develop and test driverless cars, but it is also important to consider the potential risks. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, but we need to be aware of the potential risks and challenges. ""We need to ensure that driverless cars are safe, reliable and do not lead to increased congestion."" The DfT report is based on a study of the impact of driverless cars on traffic in London. The study found that the introduction of driverless cars could lead to a 20% increase in traffic levels in the capital. The study also found that driverless cars could make it more difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. The RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, said that the government's concerns were ""valid"". RAC Foundation spokesman Steve Gooding said: ""The government is right to be cautious about the potential impact of driverless cars on congestion. ""We need to make sure that we don't end up with a situation where driverless cars simply replace human drivers, leading to more cars on the road and more congestion."" The government is currently consulting on the future of driverless cars. The consultation will close on 11 September 2018.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Hong Kong-Singapore travel corridor postponed,"Covid-19: Hong Kong-Singapore travel corridor postponed Hong Kong and Singapore have postponed the launch of their much-anticipated travel corridor due to a surge in coronavirus cases in the city-state. The so-called air travel bubble was due to begin on 22 November, allowing quarantine-free travel between the two cities. But Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday that the launch would be delayed, citing a ""significant increase"" in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city-state in recent days. The ministry did not give a new date for the launch of the travel corridor. Hong Kong's government said it ""deeply regrets"" the postponement but understands the decision made by Singapore. ""We will continue to closely monitor the situation in Singapore and will work with the Singapore government to explore the earliest possible resumption of the travel corridor,"" a government spokesman said. The travel corridor was seen as a major step forward in the recovery of the two cities' economies, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. Singapore has reported more than 58,000 cases of Covid-19, including 29 deaths. Hong Kong has reported more than 5,400 cases, including 108 deaths. The postponement of the travel corridor is a setback for both cities, but it is also a reminder that the pandemic is not over. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the global pandemic is ""accelerating"" and that the world is ""on the brink of a dangerous winter"". The WHO has urged countries to take steps to slow the spread of the virus, including implementing social distancing measures, wearing masks, and increasing testing and contact tracing. The postponement of the Hong Kong-Singapore travel corridor is a reminder that the pandemic is still a threat and that we must all continue to take steps to protect ourselves and others.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Average speed cameras 'possible for Avon and Somerset',"Average Speed Cameras Possible for Avon and Somerset Avon and Somerset Police are considering introducing average speed cameras on some of the county's busiest roads in a bid to reduce speeding and improve road safety. The cameras would be used to monitor traffic over a longer distance, calculating the average speed of vehicles as they pass through a series of cameras. This is in contrast to traditional speed cameras, which only measure the speed of vehicles at a single point in time. The cameras would be used on roads with a high history of speeding and collisions, and where other measures, such as increased police patrols, have not been effective in reducing speeds. The cameras would be used to gather data on speeding habits and to identify repeat offenders. The cameras would be placed at strategic locations along the road, and would use a combination of sensors and cameras to track the speed of vehicles. The data would then be processed to calculate the average speed of each vehicle. If a vehicle is found to be exceeding the speed limit, the driver would be issued with a speeding ticket. The tickets would be processed in the same way as speeding tickets issued by traditional speed cameras. The introduction of average speed cameras is a controversial issue, with some drivers arguing that they are unfair and that they punish drivers who are simply making a mistake. However, the police argue that the cameras are an effective way to reduce speeding and improve road safety. The police are currently in the process of consulting with local communities and stakeholders about the proposed introduction of average speed cameras. A decision on whether or not to introduce the cameras is expected to be made later this year. In addition to the proposed average speed cameras, Avon and Somerset Police are also exploring the use of other technologies to reduce speeding, such as mobile speed cameras and speed awareness courses. The police are committed to reducing speeding on the county's roads and improving road safety for all users. The introduction of average speed cameras is one of a number of measures that the police are considering in order to achieve this goal.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Stonehenge's tallest stone 'points at winter sunrise',"In the enigmatic landscape of Salisbury Plain, where ancient secrets whisper among the rolling hills, stands the enigmatic Stonehenge. Among its iconic megaliths, one towering stone holds a celestial secret that has captivated researchers and enthusiasts for centuries. The tallest stone at Stonehenge, known as Stone 56, is an imposing sentinel that rises over 30 feet in height. Its weathered surface bears witness to the relentless passage of time, yet its astronomical alignment remains as precise as ever. As the winter solstice approaches, the rising sun casts an ethereal glow upon Stonehenge. In a breathtaking celestial phenomenon, Stone 56 perfectly aligns with the horizon, marking the moment when daylight hours begin to lengthen after the shortest day of the year. This extraordinary alignment is no mere coincidence. Stonehenge's architects meticulously positioned the stones to observe the astronomical cycles. The winter sunrise alignment served as a celestial calendar, guiding ancient people through the changing seasons. By tracking the sun's position in relation to Stone 56, they could determine the time of year and prepare for agricultural activities. The winter solstice marked the return of longer days and the promise of renewed life, making the alignment a significant event in their calendar. The sophistication of Stonehenge's astronomical knowledge continues to astound modern researchers. The builders of Stonehenge possessed an understanding of celestial mechanics that was far beyond what was previously believed possible in prehistoric times. The winter sunrise alignment is a testament to their ingenuity and the profound connection they shared with the natural world. Stonehenge stands as a symbol of human curiosity, ingenuity, and the enduring power of celestial knowledge. As the sun rises over the ancient stones each year, casting its golden rays upon Stone 56, it evokes a sense of awe and wonder. Stonehenge becomes a timeless portal connecting us to our ancestors, who gazed upon the same celestial spectacle thousands of years ago. In the tapestry of human history, Stonehenge's tallest stone serves as a beacon of scientific achievement and a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of humanity and the cosmos.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Merseyside leaders 'favour circuit breaker lockdown',"Merseyside leaders have called for a two-week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to tackle rising coronavirus cases in the region. The leaders of Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral, Knowsley, Halton, and St Helens have written to the government, urging it to impose the measures as soon as possible. In the letter, the leaders say that the region is facing a ""significant and growing problem"" with the virus, with cases rising rapidly in all six boroughs. They say that a circuit breaker lockdown would help to slow the spread of the virus and give the NHS time to prepare for a potential second wave. The leaders have also called for additional support for businesses and workers affected by the lockdown. A circuit breaker lockdown would involve closing all non-essential businesses, schools, and universities for two weeks. People would be advised to stay at home as much as possible, and only essential travel would be permitted. The government has not yet responded to the leaders' request. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the government is ""keeping all options on the table"" in terms of measures to tackle the virus. A circuit breaker lockdown would be a significant step, and it is likely to be met with some resistance. However, the leaders of Merseyside believe that it is necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to save lives. The decision of whether or not to impose a circuit breaker lockdown will ultimately be made by the government. However, the request from the leaders of Merseyside is likely to add to the pressure on the government to take action. In addition to the circuit breaker lockdown, the leaders of Merseyside have also called for a number of other measures to be implemented, including: Increased testing and contact tracing More support for businesses and workers A public awareness campaign to encourage people to follow the rules A review of the government's current strategy for dealing with the pandemic The leaders say that these measures are essential to prevent the virus from spreading further and to protect the people of Merseyside.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Firefighters rescue 'record' number of people,"Firefighters have rescued a record number of people from fires in England this year, new figures show. The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said there were 4,850 rescues between April and September 2022, up from 4,432 during the same period last year. The majority of rescues (65%) were from house fires, while others were from commercial buildings, vehicles, and other structures. The NFCC said the increase in rescues is likely due to a number of factors, including the rising number of fires in the UK, the increased use of smoke alarms, and the improved training of firefighters. ""This is a significant increase in the number of rescues that firefighters are carrying out,"" said Mark Hardingham, chair of the NFCC's Protection Committee. ""It is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our firefighters that they are able to save so many lives."" The figures come as the number of fires in the UK continues to rise. According to the NFCC, there were 244,000 fires in the UK in 2021/22, up from 218,000 the previous year. The NFCC is calling on the public to take steps to reduce the risk of fire in their homes and businesses. ""We urge everyone to take fire safety seriously,"" said Hardingham. ""There are a number of simple steps that you can take to reduce the risk of a fire in your home or business, such as fitting smoke alarms, checking electrical appliances regularly, and keeping flammable materials away from heat sources."" The NFCC also recommends that people have a fire escape plan in place and practice it regularly. ""If there is a fire in your home or business, it is important to know what to do and how to get out safely,"" said Hardingham. ""Having a fire escape plan in place and practicing it regularly will help you to stay calm and make the right decisions in an emergency.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
How Liam Payne and Alesso made their new video in lockdown,"Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Liam Payne and Alesso have managed to release a music video for their new single, ""Midnight,"" without leaving their homes. The video, which was directed by Payne and Alesso themselves, was shot entirely using iPhones and features the two artists performing the song in their respective homes. In an interview with BBC News, Payne said that the idea for the video came about after he and Alesso were forced to cancel their plans to shoot a more traditional video due to the lockdown. ""We were both really disappointed when we had to cancel our original plans for the video,"" Payne said. ""But then we started talking about how we could still make it work, and we came up with the idea of shooting it ourselves."" Alesso added: ""We wanted to make sure that the video still had the same energy and excitement as our original concept, even though we were shooting it in our homes. We used a lot of creative camera angles and editing techniques to make it as visually interesting as possible."" The video has been praised for its creativity and innovation, and has already racked up millions of views on YouTube. Payne and Alesso said that they were pleased with the final product and that they hope it inspires other artists to be creative during the pandemic.

Abuser ordered to tell police about new relationships,"An abuser has been ordered by a court to tell police about any new relationships he forms. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victim, was given the order as part of a two-year suspended sentence. He had previously pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and coercive and controlling behaviour. The court heard that the man had subjected his victim to a campaign of violence and intimidation, including punching her, kicking her, and threatening to kill her. He also controlled her finances, isolated her from her friends and family, and made her feel worthless. In a victim impact statement, the woman said that the abuse had had a devastating impact on her life. She said: ""I was living in constant fear. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, and I couldn't leave the house. I felt like I was going to die."" The woman said that she was now rebuilding her life, but that she still lived with the fear that her abuser would find her. She said: ""I am terrified that he will come after me again. I don't know how I would cope if he did."" The court heard that the man had a history of violence and had been convicted of assaulting a previous partner. The judge said that the man posed a significant risk to women and that the order was necessary to protect them. The judge said: ""This is a very serious case of domestic violence. The defendant subjected his victim to a sustained campaign of violence and intimidation. He has shown no remorse for his actions and poses a significant risk to women."" The order means that the man must tell the police about any new relationships he forms within three days. He must also provide the police with the name, address, and contact details of his new partner. The order will remain in place for two years. If the man breaches the order, he could be jailed. The police said that they would be working with the man to ensure that he complies with the order. A spokesman said: ""This order is a welcome step in protecting women from domestic violence. It sends a clear message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Neil Gorsuch pick: How did Trump keep choice secret?,"Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court was a closely guarded secret, with President Trump only revealing his pick to a select few aides. According to sources familiar with the process, Trump began meeting with potential nominees in November, but kept the list of candidates very small. He eventually settled on Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, in early January. Trump's decision to keep the nomination secret was a departure from the norm. In recent years, presidents have typically announced their Supreme Court picks weeks or even months in advance. This gives the public and the Senate time to vet the nominee and prepare for the confirmation hearings. However, Trump's team believed that keeping the nomination secret would give them an advantage. They feared that if the list of candidates was made public, it would be leaked to the media and the Democrats would have time to mount a campaign against the nominee. In the end, Trump's strategy was successful. The nomination of Gorsuch was a surprise to many, and the Democrats were left scrambling to prepare for the confirmation hearings. Gorsuch was eventually confirmed by the Senate in a 54-45 vote. There are a number of reasons why Trump may have chosen to keep the nomination secret. First, he may have wanted to avoid the media scrutiny that would have come with a public announcement. Second, he may have wanted to prevent the Democrats from having time to organize opposition to the nominee. Third, he may have simply wanted to keep his options open until the last minute. Whatever his reasons, Trump's decision to keep the nomination secret was a significant departure from the norm. It is a sign of the new era of politics in which we live, in which secrecy and surprise have become the norm. The nomination of Neil Gorsuch is a major victory for President Trump. Gorsuch is a conservative judge who is likely to side with the court's conservative bloc on many issues. His appointment will likely have a significant impact on American law for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Call for e-cigarette safety warnings,"Call for E-cigarette Safety Warnings As the popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) continues to surge, concerns have been raised about their potential health risks. In a bid to mitigate these concerns, the BBC is calling for mandatory safety warnings to be placed on all e-cigarette packaging. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that deliver nicotine, flavourings, and other chemicals in aerosol form. While they are often marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, there is growing evidence that they may pose health risks of their own. Long-term studies on the effects of e-cigarettes are still lacking, but research has shown that they can damage cells, increase inflammation, and harm the cardiovascular system. Some studies have also linked e-cigarette use to lung damage, including a condition called ""popcorn lung"". In addition to the potential health hazards, e-cigarettes are also a gateway to nicotine addiction for young people. The sweet flavours and sleek designs of e-cigarettes make them appealing to children and teenagers, who may not realize the risks involved. Mandatory safety warnings on e-cigarette packaging would be a crucial step towards protecting public health. These warnings should clearly state the potential health risks associated with e-cigarette use, including the risk of addiction and the long-term health consequences. Warnings should also include information on how to avoid the dangers of e-cigarettes, such as avoiding products containing harmful ingredients or using them as a gateway to smoking. The tobacco industry has long used misleading advertising tactics to downplay the risks of smoking. E-cigarette manufacturers are employing similar tactics, targeting young people and making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of their products. Mandatory safety warnings would provide consumers with accurate information about the risks of e-cigarettes, allowing them to make informed decisions about their health. It is essential that the government takes action to protect the public from the dangers posed by these unregulated products. In conclusion, the BBC calls for mandatory safety warnings to be placed on all e-cigarette packaging. These warnings are vital for informing consumers about the potential health risks, preventing e-cigarette addiction, and protecting the health of the general public.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Forgotten cache of RNLI pictures 'preserved for posterity',"Forgotten Cache of RNLI Pictures Preserved for Posterity A remarkable cache of historic photographs, capturing the heroic work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), has been rediscovered and meticulously preserved. These images, long hidden away in a forgotten archive, provide a poignant and captivating glimpse into the lifesaving service's extraordinary past. The collection spans decades, from the early days of the RNLI in the mid-19th century to the present day. It features dramatic scenes of rescues at sea, from storm-tossed lifeboats battling towering waves to daring rescues of stranded individuals. Notable among them is a series of images depicting the infamous Penlee lifeboat disaster of 1981, in which 16 people tragically lost their lives. The photographs not only document the RNLI's valiant efforts but also offer invaluable insights into the evolution of lifesaving techniques and equipment. They showcase the transition from traditional open lifeboats rowed by brave volunteers to the modern, technologically advanced vessels that patrol the UK's coastline today. The cache was discovered by a team of RNLI archivists who were conducting a thorough review of the organization's vast collection of historical artifacts. ""We were astonished to find these images,"" said lead archivist Emily Jones. ""They had been completely forgotten about and were in danger of being lost forever."" The images were carefully scanned and digitized, ensuring their preservation for future generations. They are now available online through the RNLI's website, allowing the public to explore this extraordinary heritage and appreciate the remarkable stories behind them. ""These photographs are not only a valuable historical record but also a powerful reminder of the courage and selflessness of the RNLI's crews,"" said RNLI CEO Mark Dowie. ""They serve as a testament to the organization's unwavering commitment to saving lives at sea."" The rediscovered cache has sparked renewed interest in the RNLI's history and the vital role it plays in coastal safety. It has also inspired the creation of a new documentary film, ""RNLI: The Forgotten Heroes,"" which will premiere on BBC Four later this year. The film will showcase the extraordinary images and the stories behind them, highlighting the unwavering heroism of the RNLI's brave volunteers. The preservation of this forgotten cache of photographs ensures that the legacy of the RNLI's lifesaving work will continue to inspire and inform future generations, safeguarding the memory of those who have risked their lives to protect others.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'No sprinklers in 96% of London high-rise council blocks',"No Sprinklers in 96% of London High-Rise Council Blocks London's high-rise council blocks are dangerously ill-prepared for a fire, with 96% lacking sprinklers. This shocking statistic was revealed by a freedom of information request submitted by the BBC. Sprinklers are a proven life-saving measure, and their widespread absence in London's council blocks is a serious threat to residents. In the event of a fire, sprinklers can contain the blaze, allowing time for people to escape and for firefighters to arrive. The London Fire Brigade has repeatedly called for sprinklers to be installed in all high-rise buildings, regardless of their age or height. However, the government has so far refused to make them mandatory, arguing that it would be too expensive. The cost of installing sprinklers in all of London's high-rise council blocks is estimated to be around £1.5bn. This is a significant investment, but it is a small price to pay for the safety of the people who live in these buildings. The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which claimed the lives of 72 people, highlighted the urgent need for sprinklers in high-rise buildings. The fire spread rapidly through the building, due in part to the lack of sprinklers. In the wake of the Grenfell fire, the government announced that it would invest £400m in fire safety measures, including sprinklers. However, this funding is only a fraction of what is needed to make all of London's high-rise council blocks safe. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called on the government to do more to ensure the safety of residents in high-rise buildings. He said: ""It is unacceptable that so many Londoners are living in homes that are not properly protected from fire."" The lack of sprinklers in London's high-rise council blocks is a national scandal. The government must act now to make these buildings safe for residents.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The French government has warned that if the situation does not improve, Paris could be placed under a maximum alert level, which would see stricter measures imposed, including a curfew. The move would be a major blow to the city, which is already struggling with the economic impact of the pandemic. Many businesses have been forced to close, and unemployment has risen sharply. The government is under pressure to act, but it is aware that any new restrictions will be unpopular. Many people are already tired of the pandemic and the restrictions that have been imposed. However, the government is also aware that it cannot afford to let the virus spread unchecked. The number of deaths in France has now passed 100,000, and the health system is struggling to cope with the number of new cases. The government is expected to make a decision on whether to place Paris under maximum alert level in the coming days. If it does, the new measures will come into force on Sunday. The measures would include: A curfew from 9pm to 6am The closure of non-essential businesses A ban on gatherings of more than 10 people The closure of schools and universities The government has said that the measures will be reviewed after two weeks. If the situation does not improve, the measures could be extended or even tightened. The move to maximum alert level would be a major step, and it is unclear how the public will react.

Outrage as Emirates tells cabin crew to remove Taiwan flag pins,"Cabin crew for Emirates have been told to remove pins bearing the Taiwanese flag from their uniforms, sparking outrage and accusations of bowing to pressure from China. The directive from the Dubai-based airline, first reported by Taiwan News, comes amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. Taiwan's foreign ministry said it ""deeply regrets"" the decision, while the island's de facto embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has lodged a formal complaint with the airline. ""We urge the company to reconsider its decision and respect the rights of its employees to express their support for Taiwan,"" the ministry said in a statement. In a statement, Emirates said it ""respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations"" and that its uniform policy is ""in line with our commitment to neutrality and respect for international laws and regulations."" The airline added that it ""does not tolerate any form of discrimination or bias against any nationality or group of people."" However, critics have accused Emirates of succumbing to pressure from China, which has been increasingly assertive in its claims over Taiwan. ""This is a clear case of China bullying a foreign company into submission,"" said Wu Chih-chung, a spokesman for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. ""It's outrageous and it shows that China is willing to go to any lengths to silence its critics.""

""Emirates should be ashamed of themselves for caving in to China's demands."" ""I will never fly Emirates again,"" vowed another. The controversy comes at a sensitive time for relations between Taiwan and China. In recent months, China has stepped up its military activity around Taiwan, and has also been pressuring other countries to cut ties with the island. Taiwan, meanwhile, has been pushing back against China's claims, and has been seeking support from the international community. The Emirates incident is likely to further strain relations between the two sides.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

"Cat ownership rise driven by men, survey suggests","Cat ownership has surged in recent years, with men driving the trend, a survey suggests. The study, by the pet food brand Purina, found that the number of male cat owners in the UK has risen by 15% in the past five years. This has helped to close the gap with female cat owners, who still make up the majority (57%) of cat owners. The survey also found that men are more likely to own cats than dogs, with 38% of men owning a cat compared to 30% of women. This is a reversal of the trend seen in previous years, when women were more likely to own cats than men. There are a number of factors that may be driving the increase in male cat ownership. One possibility is that men are becoming more aware of the benefits of owning a cat. Cats are relatively low-maintenance pets that can provide companionship and affection. They can also be helpful for reducing stress and loneliness. Another possibility is that men are more likely to be living in urban areas, where cats are a more popular pet than dogs. Dogs require more space and exercise than cats, which can make them less suitable for people living in apartments or other small spaces. Whatever the reason, the increase in male cat ownership is a positive trend. Cats can provide companionship, affection, and other benefits to their owners. They can also help to improve people's mental and physical health. The survey also found that cat ownership is more popular among younger people. This is likely due to the fact that younger people are more likely to live in urban areas and to be aware of the benefits of owning a cat. The increase in cat ownership is a positive trend for a number of reasons. Cats can provide companionship, affection, and other benefits to their owners. They can also help to improve people's mental and physical health. If you are thinking about getting a pet, a cat may be the perfect choice for you.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pro-and anti-Spearmint Rhino protesters in Sheffield stand-off,"Pro- and anti-Spearmint Rhino protesters have clashed in a stand-off in Sheffield city centre. The protest erupted outside the Spearmint Rhino gentlemen's club on West Street on Saturday evening. Around 20 protesters from Sheffield Against Men's Violence (SAMV) gathered outside the club, holding placards and chanting slogans. They were met by a group of around 10 counter-protesters, who said they were there to support the club and its workers. The two groups faced off across the street, with police officers standing between them. There were several heated exchanges, but the protest remained peaceful. SAMV said it was protesting against the club's ""exploitation of women"". ""Spearmint Rhino is a symbol of the objectification and commodification of women,"" said a spokesperson for the group. ""We are here to say that we will not tolerate this kind of business in our city."" The counter-protesters said they were there to support the club and its workers. ""These women have the right to work where they want,"" said one counter-protester. ""They are not being exploited. They are choosing to do this work."" The protest lasted for around two hours, before both groups dispersed. A spokesperson for Spearmint Rhino said the club was ""disappointed"" by the protest. ""We are a legitimate business,"" the spokesperson said. ""We provide a safe and enjoyable environment for our customers and our staff."" South Yorkshire Police said it was aware of the protest and that officers were in attendance.

Appeal after storm grounds seabirds in Pembrokeshire,"Appeal after storm grounds seabirds in Pembrokeshire A wildlife charity is appealing for help after a severe storm washed hundreds of seabirds ashore in Pembrokeshire. The RSPCA said it had received reports of more than 500 birds being found grounded along the county's coastline over the weekend. The charity said the birds, which included guillemots, razorbills and puffins, were likely to have been blown inland by the strong winds and high waves. Many of the birds were found exhausted and hypothermic, and some had suffered injuries. The RSPCA is urging people to report any sightings of grounded seabirds to its helpline on 0300 1234 999. The charity said it was working with other organisations, including the Welsh Wildlife Trust, to rescue and rehabilitate the birds. ""We are doing everything we can to help these birds,"" said RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben. ""But we need the public's help to let us know where the birds are so we can get them to safety as quickly as possible."" The RSPCA said it was particularly concerned about the welfare of puffins, which are a protected species in the UK. ""Puffins are particularly vulnerable to this type of weather because they are not strong fliers,"" said Hogben. ""They can easily be blown inland by the wind and become exhausted and hypothermic."" The RSPCA is advising people not to try to handle grounded seabirds themselves. ""If you find a grounded seabird, please call the RSPCA helpline on 0300 1234 999,"" said Hogben. ""We will then be able to send a trained rescuer to help the bird."" The RSPCA said it was also reminding people to keep their dogs on leads near the coast. ""Dogs can chase and injure grounded seabirds,"" said Hogben. ""Please keep your dog on a lead if you are walking near the coast."" The RSPCA said it was grateful to the members of the public who had already reported sightings of grounded seabirds. ""We are very grateful to the public for their help,"" said Hogben. ""We couldn't do this without you.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
South Korea warns Japan over comfort women review,"South Korea has warned Japan of ""grave consequences"" if it reviews a landmark agreement on wartime sex slaves. The 2015 deal saw Japan apologise and make a 1bn yen (£7.2m) payment to South Korean victims of its wartime sexual slavery. But Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said his government is considering whether to revise elements of the deal. South Korea's foreign ministry said such a review would ""fundamentally shake"" bilateral ties. During World War Two, tens of thousands of women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says that South Korea has been incensed by Mr Abe's comments. ""This could be a major turning point in relations between the two countries,"" she says. The 2015 agreement was reached after extensive negotiations led by then South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Mr Abe. It was hailed as a rare breakthrough on an issue that has long been a source of tension between the two nations. But Mr Abe has since said that the deal was ""rushed"" and he had ""serious doubts"" about whether it addressed Japan's legal responsibilities. South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""If the Japanese government unilaterally revises the agreement, it will fundamentally shake the foundation of the Republic of Korea-Japan relations."" The ministry added that South Korea had repeatedly warned Japan against revisiting the deal. ""If the Japanese government defies those warnings, it will inevitably face grave consequences,"" the statement said. Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said that the government was still ""examining the facts"" about the 2015 deal. He added that Japan ""intends to continue working with the Republic of Korea to build future-oriented relations based on the correct understanding of history"". The US has said it is monitoring the situation closely. ""We believe that it is of paramount importance for both Japan and the Republic of Korea to work together to resolve this and other historical issues in a sensitive manner,"" a state department spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Grape choke inquest: PC 'desperate' for help with girl,"In a tragic incident that has sent shockwaves through the community, an inquest has revealed the desperate efforts made by a police officer to save an 11-year-old girl who choked to death on a grape. The inquest heard how PC David Clifton was on patrol in a park when he was approached by the girl's mother, who frantically told him that her daughter was choking. PC Clifton immediately rushed to the scene and found the girl lying on the ground, unconscious and unresponsive. She was not breathing and had no pulse. Without hesitation, PC Clifton began performing CPR, assisted by members of the public who had witnessed the incident. However, despite their best efforts, the girl's condition deteriorated rapidly. Paramedics arrived on the scene and took over resuscitation attempts, but the girl was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at the hospital. The inquest heard that the girl had been eating grapes when she suddenly started choking. Her airway became completely blocked, preventing her from breathing. PC Clifton told the inquest that he had been ""desperate"" to save the girl, but that there was nothing he could do. He said he had ""tried everything"" to clear her airway, but the grape was lodged too deeply. The coroner praised PC Clifton's ""heroic"" efforts and said he had done everything in his power to save the girl. However, he ruled that her death was a tragic accident and that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The girl's family expressed their gratitude to PC Clifton and the paramedics who had tried to save her. They said they were ""heartbroken"" by her death, but comforted by the knowledge that she had received the best possible care. The inquest has highlighted the importance of first aid training and the need for members of the public to be aware of the dangers of choking. It is hoped that the lessons learned from this tragedy will help to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Cancer patient 'given drug overdose after hospital pharmacy error',"A cancer patient was given a fatal overdose of chemotherapy drugs after a ""catastrophic"" error at a hospital pharmacy, an inquest has heard. Tracey Wright, 59, was receiving treatment for breast cancer at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading when she was given a dose of vinblastine that was 10 times the safe limit. The inquest heard that the error occurred because a pharmacist misread the patient's weight and calculated the wrong dose. The pharmacist, who has not been named, has since been suspended from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Mrs. Wright's family said they were ""devastated"" by her death and called for a full investigation into the incident. They said they had been told that the hospital had since changed its procedures to prevent a similar error from happening again. The inquest heard that Mrs. Wright was admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in March 2018 for a course of chemotherapy. She was given her first dose of vinblastine on March 27 and suffered no adverse effects. However, when she returned for her second dose on April 3, she was given a dose that was 10 times the safe limit. The inquest heard that the pharmacist who calculated the dose had misread Mrs. Wright's weight as 54 kg instead of 5.4 kg. As a result of the overdose, Mrs. Wright suffered a cardiac arrest and died on April 5. The inquest heard that the hospital had since carried out a full investigation into the incident and had identified a number of areas where improvements could be made. The hospital said it had changed its procedures to prevent a similar error from happening again. These changes include: Introducing a new system for checking and double-checking the doses of chemotherapy drugs. Providing additional training for pharmacists who calculate and prepare chemotherapy drugs. Implementing a new system for monitoring the administration of chemotherapy drugs. The hospital said it had also offered its sincere apologies to Mrs. Wright's family and expressed its condolences for their loss. The inquest is ongoing.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Tupac-loving US public servant fired as emails emerge,"Tupac-Loving US Public Servant Fired as Emails Emerge A US public servant has been fired after emails emerged revealing his admiration for the late rapper Tupac Shakur and his use of controversial language. Carl James, a former employee of the California Department of Transportation, was dismissed after an investigation into his emails, which were obtained through a public records request. The emails, dating back several years, show James frequently using the N-word and other offensive language. He also expresses admiration for Tupac, a controversial figure known for his violent lyrics and criminal past. In one email, James refers to Tupac as a ""hero"" and says he is ""inspired by his message of resistance."" In another, he quotes Tupac's lyrics about killing police officers. James's admiration for Tupac has raised concerns about his suitability for a public-facing role. Critics argue that his views are incompatible with the values of an inclusive and progressive society. ""These emails are deeply offensive and show a lack of judgment that is simply unacceptable for a public servant,"" said Amy Johnson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Transportation. James has defended his use of language, saying that he was simply quoting Tupac's lyrics and that he does not endorse the violence or hate speech that the rapper sometimes advocated. ""I am a huge Tupac fan, and I believe that his music has a powerful message,"" James said in a statement. ""However, I do not agree with everything that he said or did."" James's firing has sparked a debate about the role of free speech in public life. Some argue that public servants should be held to a higher standard and should not be allowed to express offensive or controversial views. Others defend James's right to free speech, even if they disagree with his opinions. They argue that firing him for his emails sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to a chilling effect on free speech. The case of Carl James is a complex one that raises important questions about the balance between free speech and public service. Ultimately, it is up to the public to decide whether they believe that James's emails disqualify him from holding a public office.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Banksy donates funds from anti-arms artwork sale,"In a compassionate gesture of solidarity, renowned street artist Banksy has donated an undisclosed amount of funds raised from the sale of an anti-arms artwork to a humanitarian organization providing assistance to conflict-affected communities. The artwork, titled ""Love is in the Bin,"" was famously self-destructed in a shredder concealed within the frame moments after it was sold for over $1.4 million at Sotheby's auction house in 2018. The enigmatic artist later released a statement on Instagram, stating: ""It appears I was outbid by a destructive force."" Undeterred, Sotheby's resold the artwork with its shredded remnants intact, retitled as ""Love is in the Bin (Shredded),"" for a staggering $25.4 million in 2021. Banksy's donation represents a significant portion of the proceeds from this sale. The recipient of the funds, whose identity remains undisclosed at Banksy's request, is a non-profit organization specializing in providing medical care, food, and shelter to communities ravaged by armed conflicts and humanitarian crises around the world. The organization expressed immense gratitude for the generous donation, which will enable them to expand their life-saving operations. ""This donation is a testament to Banksy's unwavering commitment to using his art to highlight the devastating consequences of armed conflicts,"" said a spokesperson for the organization. ""These funds will go a long way in providing vital assistance to those who have been most affected by war and violence."" Banksy has long been an outspoken critic of the arms industry and the proliferation of weapons in conflict zones. His anti-war message has been expressed through a series of thought-provoking and often subversive works of art, including murals, sculptures, and installations. The donation of funds from the sale of ""Love is in the Bin (Shredded)"" marks a significant step in the artist's ongoing efforts to raise awareness and generate support for those suffering the devastating effects of armed conflicts. It is a powerful reminder of the transformative power of art in fostering compassion and promoting social justice.

It is a testament to the enduring impact of art as a catalyst for positive change and a call to action for others to support humanitarian efforts worldwide.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Single market membership 'probably unlikely',"Brexit: Single Market Membership 'Probably Unlikely' As the UK government continues to negotiate its exit from the European Union, the possibility of remaining a member of the single market has become increasingly remote. The single market is an area within the EU where goods, services, capital, and people move freely without barriers. It is one of the cornerstones of the EU and has been a key driver of economic growth and prosperity for its members. However, the UK government has made it clear that it wants to leave the single market in order to be able to control its own borders and laws. This would mean that the UK would have to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU, which would likely result in the imposition of tariffs and other barriers to trade. The economic impact of leaving the single market is likely to be significant. The UK would lose access to its largest market, and businesses would face higher costs and more bureaucracy. This could lead to job losses and lower wages. The government has argued that the UK can make up for the loss of access to the single market by striking new trade deals with other countries around the world. However, there is no guarantee that these new deals will be as выгодный as the UK's current access to the single market. In addition to the economic impact, leaving the single market would also have a political impact. The UK would no longer be part of the EU's decision-making process, and would have less influence over the rules that govern the single market. This could lead to the UK becoming more isolated and less influential in the world. The government has also said that it wants to leave the single market in order to be able to control its own immigration policy. However, it is not clear how leaving the single market would allow the UK to do this. The UK would still be able to trade with EU countries, and people would still be able to move freely between the UK and the EU. The government has said that it is willing to walk away from the negotiations without a deal if it cannot get the deal it wants. This would mean that the UK would leave the EU without any transition period, and there would be no new trade deal in place. This would be a worst-case scenario for the UK economy, and would lead to significant disruption and chaos. The government has said that it is confident that it will be able to negotiate a good deal for the UK. However, the EU has said that it is not willing to compromise on the single market. This suggests that the UK is likely to have to make significant concessions in order to get a deal. It is increasingly likely that the UK will leave the single market when it leaves the EU. This will have a significant economic and political impact on the UK. The government has said that it is confident that it can mitigate the negative effects of leaving the single market, but it is not clear how it will do this.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Brexit Party joins cross-party alliance for voting reform,"The Brexit Party has joined a cross-party alliance of small parties and independent politicians calling for changes to the UK's electoral system. The alliance, known as the Electoral Reform Alliance (ERA), wants to introduce proportional representation (PR) into the UK's parliamentary elections. Under the current first-past-the-post system, the candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected as the MP, even if they do not receive a majority of the votes. This can lead to situations where a party with a large share of the national vote ends up with very few MPs, while a party with a smaller share of the vote can end up with a large number of MPs. PR systems are designed to ensure that the proportion of seats won by each party more closely reflects the proportion of votes cast for that party. The ERA is calling for a form of PR known as the single transferable vote (STV). Under STV, voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives an outright majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to their second-preference candidate. This process continues until one candidate receives a majority of the votes. The Brexit Party's decision to join the ERA is a significant development, as it suggests that there is growing support for electoral reform among parties from across the political spectrum. The Conservative Party has traditionally been opposed to PR, but there have been growing calls for the party to reconsider its position in recent years. The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party have long been supporters of PR, and the Labour Party has also expressed support for the idea in the past. The ERA is hoping to build on this growing support and persuade the government to hold a referendum on electoral reform. A referendum on electoral reform was held in 2011, but it was defeated by a large margin. However, the ERA believes that public opinion has shifted in favor of PR since then, and that a new referendum would produce a different result.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
BP given consent for deep-water well North Uist west of Shetland,"The energy giant BP has been given consent by the UK government to drill a deep-water well west of Shetland. The well, known as North Uist, is located in the Atlantic Margin area, which is thought to hold significant oil and gas reserves. BP said it would use the latest technology to minimize the environmental impact of the drilling. The company said it had already carried out extensive surveys of the area and had found no evidence of any sensitive habitats or species that could be affected by the drilling. However, environmental groups have expressed concern about the potential impact of the drilling on the local marine environment. Greenpeace said the drilling would release harmful chemicals into the water and could damage fish stocks. The group also said that the drilling could lead to an oil spill, which would have a devastating impact on the local wildlife. BP said it was aware of the concerns of environmental groups and was committed to minimizing the environmental impact of the drilling. The company said it would use the latest technology to prevent any oil spills and would have a team of experts on hand to respond to any incidents. The UK government said it had taken into account the environmental concerns before approving the drilling. The government said it was confident that BP would take all necessary precautions to protect the environment. The drilling is expected to start in the summer of 2023. If successful, the well could produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil per day. This would be a significant boost to the UK's oil and gas production. However, environmental groups have vowed to continue to oppose the drilling. Greenpeace said it would be monitoring the drilling closely and would take legal action if necessary to protect the environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nicky Verstappen cold case killing ends in jail after 22 years,"The cold case killing of Nicky Verstappen has finally been solved after 22 years, with a 52-year-old man sentenced to life in prison. Jos Brech was found guilty of murdering the 11-year-old boy, who disappeared while on a camping trip in 1998. His body was found in a ditch a few days later. The case went unsolved for decades, despite a massive police investigation and several suspects being questioned. However, in 2018, new DNA evidence linked Brech to the crime. Brech was arrested and charged with murder in 2020. He denied the charges, but a jury at the Maastricht District Court found him guilty on Tuesday. The verdict was met with relief by Nicky's family, who have campaigned tirelessly for justice. His mother, Berthie Verstappen, said she was ""overwhelmed"" by the news. ""We have been waiting for this for 22 years,"" she said. ""We can finally close this chapter and start to heal."" The case has been one of the most high-profile unsolved murders in the Netherlands. It has been the subject of numerous television documentaries and newspaper articles. The breakthrough in the case came thanks to advances in DNA technology. In 2018, police were able to extract DNA from a T-shirt that Nicky was wearing when he disappeared. This DNA was then matched to Brech. Brech is a convicted sex offender who has a history of violence. He was previously convicted of raping two women in the 1980s. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Brech had abducted Nicky while he was riding his bike through a forest. They said that Brech had then sexually assaulted and murdered the boy. Brech's defense team argued that he was not guilty of the crime and that the DNA evidence was unreliable. However, the jury rejected their arguments and found him guilty. The verdict is a major victory for the police and prosecutors who worked on the case. It is also a vindication for Nicky's family, who have never given up hope of finding justice for their son.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Strictly: Aston's exit shocks fans but who's to blame?,"Strictly: Aston's exit shocks fans but who's to blame? Aston Merrygold's shock departure from Strictly Come Dancing has sent shockwaves through the Strictly fandom. The former JLS star was one of the favorites to win the competition, but he and his professional partner Janette Manrara were eliminated in the semi-final after losing a dance-off to Debbie McGee and Giovanni Pernice. Merrygold's exit has prompted a wave of speculation about who is to blame for his shock departure. Some fans have accused the judges of being biased against him, while others have pointed the finger at Manrara, claiming she did not do enough to help him improve his dancing. However, Merrygold himself has taken full responsibility for his exit. In a statement released after his elimination, he said: ""I'm so disappointed to be leaving Strictly, but I want to thank everyone for their support. I've had an amazing time and I've learnt so much. I'm going to miss everyone involved in the show, but I'm going to take everything I've learnt and use it to improve my dancing."" So, who is to blame for Merrygold's exit? Ultimately, the answer is no one. Merrygold himself has taken responsibility for his performance, and it would be unfair to blame anyone else. It's important to remember that Strictly is a competition, and someone has to go home each week. Merrygold was simply unlucky to be the one to leave in the semi-final. However, Merrygold's exit does raise some questions about the judging on Strictly. Many fans have accused the judges of being biased against him, and it's certainly true that he was often marked down for mistakes that other dancers got away with. Whether or not the judges were biased against Merrygold is a matter of opinion. However, it's clear that he was not always treated fairly. Despite his exit, Merrygold has had a positive experience on Strictly. He has learnt a lot about dancing, and he has made some lifelong friends. He should be proud of everything he has achieved on the show.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Scottish wildcats 'not wild' about snow, says SNH report","Despite their rugged appearance and habitat, Scottish wildcats are ""not wild"" about snow, according to a new report by NatureScot, formerly known as Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). The study found that the iconic felines, which are native to Scotland and have been designated as a priority species for conservation, struggle to hunt and move in snowy conditions. The report, which was based on data collected from GPS tracking collars fitted to 12 wildcats in the Cairngorms National Park, found that the animals' activity levels dropped significantly when snow cover exceeded 10 cm. This was likely due to the difficulty they had in moving through the snow and finding prey. Dr. Robbie McDonald, NatureScot's Species Conservation Officer, said: ""This study provides us with valuable insights into the behaviour of Scottish wildcats in snowy conditions. We know that wildcats are adapted to living in harsh conditions, but our research shows that they do struggle when the snow gets too deep. This is something we need to be aware of as we consider the future conservation of this iconic species."" The study also found that wildcats were more likely to use roads and tracks when there was snow on the ground. This suggests that they may be using these features to help them move around and find food. However, Dr. McDonald warned that this could also make them more vulnerable to being hit by vehicles. He said: ""We need to be mindful of the potential impacts of snow on wildcats and take steps to mitigate these risks. For example, we could consider reducing the speed limit on roads in areas where wildcats are known to occur, or erecting signs to warn drivers of the presence of these animals."" The Scottish wildcat is one of the UK's most endangered mammals, with an estimated population of just 100-300 individuals. The species has been in decline for a number of years due to habitat loss, persecution, and interbreeding with domestic cats. NatureScot is working to conserve the Scottish wildcat by protecting and managing its habitat, reducing the number of feral cats, and raising awareness of the importance of this iconic species.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Alison Lapper's son Parys 'bullied at school' before death,"Alison Lapper's son Parys, who was born with the same rare condition as his mother, was bullied at school before his death, according to an inquest. Parys Lapper, 19, had phocomelia, which meant he was born without arms and legs. He was found dead at his home in Worthing, West Sussex, in April 2019. An inquest into his death heard that he had been bullied at school about his disability. His mother, Alison Lapper, said she had raised concerns with the school but felt they were not taken seriously enough. The inquest heard that Parys had been feeling down in the months leading up to his death. He had been struggling with his mental health and had been self-harming. In a statement read to the inquest, Alison Lapper said: ""Parys was a very loving and caring person. He was always smiling and had a great sense of humour. ""He was also very determined and never let his disability hold him back. He was a great artist and loved to play music. ""But he was also very sensitive and found it hard to deal with the bullying he experienced at school. He felt like he was different and that no one understood him. ""I tried to support him as much as I could, but I felt like I was failing him. I didn't know how to protect him from the pain he was feeling."" The inquest heard that Parys had been seeing a psychiatrist in the months leading up to his death. He had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The psychiatrist said that Parys had been feeling increasingly isolated and hopeless. He had also been struggling with the physical challenges of his disability. The inquest concluded that Parys had died by suicide. The coroner said that bullying had been a factor in his death. Alison Lapper said she was ""heartbroken"" by her son's death. She said she hoped that his story would raise awareness of the devastating impact of bullying. ""No one should have to suffer the way Parys did,"" she said. ""Bullying is a scourge that can destroy lives."" The inquest heard that the school where Parys was bullied had since taken steps to improve its anti-bullying policies. A spokesperson for the school said: ""We are deeply saddened by the death of Parys Lapper. We extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends. ""We are committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students. We have reviewed our anti-bullying policies and procedures and have made a number of changes to strengthen them.

Brit Awards 2018: Kendrick Lamar's drug and sex references were muted by ITV,"The Brit Awards 2018 was a star-studded event that celebrated the best of British music. However, one performance that has caused controversy was Kendrick Lamar's rendition of his hit song 'King Kunta'. During the performance, Lamar rapped the lyrics ""I'm never scared to admit when I was wrong"" and ""I'm never scared to admit when I was wrong."" These lyrics were muted by ITV, the channel that was broadcasting the awards ceremony. Some viewers have criticized ITV for muting Lamar's lyrics, arguing that it was an act of censorship. Others have defended ITV's decision, arguing that the lyrics were inappropriate for a family audience. Lamar is known for his explicit lyrics, which often deal with themes of race, poverty, and violence. His performance at the Brit Awards was no different, and he rapped about his experiences growing up in Compton, California. The decision to mute Lamar's lyrics has sparked a debate about the role of censorship in music. Some argue that censorship is necessary to protect children from inappropriate content. Others argue that censorship is a form of suppression that stifles creativity. The Brit Awards are one of the most prestigious music awards ceremonies in the world. They are watched by millions of people around the world. The decision to mute Lamar's lyrics has therefore sparked a global debate about the role of censorship in music. In a statement, ITV said that it had muted Lamar's lyrics because they were ""inappropriate for a family audience"". The statement said that ITV had ""a responsibility to ensure that the content we broadcast is suitable for all our viewers"". Lamar has not commented on the decision to mute his lyrics.

Police swoop on suspected darknet fake banknote buyers,"Police have arrested 12 people suspected of buying counterfeit banknotes on the dark web. The arrests were made after an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) into a network of individuals allegedly involved in the purchase and distribution of fake currency. The NCA said the suspects, aged between 21 and 65, were arrested at addresses across the UK on Thursday. Officers seized computers, mobile phones, and a quantity of suspected counterfeit banknotes during the raids. The NCA said the investigation was launched after it received intelligence about individuals using the dark web to buy counterfeit banknotes. The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that can only be accessed using special software. It is often used by criminals to buy and sell illegal goods and services. The NCA said the suspects in this case are alleged to have used the dark web to buy counterfeit banknotes from overseas vendors. The banknotes are believed to have been used to fund criminal activity, such as drug dealing and money laundering. The NCA said the arrests will disrupt the supply of counterfeit banknotes into the UK. NCA Branch Commander Steve Reynolds said: ""Counterfeit currency poses a significant threat to the UK economy and can be used to fund a wide range of criminal activity. ""This investigation has resulted in the seizure of a large quantity of counterfeit banknotes and the arrest of 12 individuals suspected of being involved in their purchase and distribution. ""We will continue to work with our partners to target those involved in counterfeiting and disrupt the supply of fake currency into the UK."" The NCA is urging anyone with information about counterfeiting to contact them on 0370 496 7622 or via its website.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Port of Dover facing 'unnecessary holdups' on 1 January,"Port of Dover facing 'unnecessary holdups' on 1 January The Port of Dover is facing ""unnecessary holdups"" on 1 January, with lorries backed up for miles as new post-Brexit border checks come into force. The port, which handles around 17% of the UK's freight traffic, is expecting significant delays as lorries are checked for the first time since the UK left the EU single market and customs union. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has warned that the delays could cause ""significant disruption"" to businesses and supply chains. The RHA's chief executive, Richard Burnett, said: ""We have been warning for months that the government's lack of preparation for the end of the transition period would lead to chaos at the ports. ""The government has failed to listen to the industry and now we are seeing the consequences."" The government has said that it is ""working closely with the Port of Dover to ensure that traffic flows smoothly."" However, the RHA said that the government's plans are ""woefully inadequate."" Burnett said: ""The government's plan to use temporary holding areas for lorries is simply not going to work. These areas are already full and there is nowhere for the lorries to go. ""The government needs to take urgent action to resolve this situation. Otherwise, we are going to see even more chaos in the coming days."" The delays at the Port of Dover are likely to have a significant impact on businesses across the UK. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the delays could cost businesses billions of pounds. The CBI's director-general, Tony Danker, said: ""The delays at the Port of Dover are a serious concern. This is just the start of the new trading relationship with the EU and it is already causing significant disruption. ""The government needs to take urgent action to resolve this situation and ensure that businesses can continue to trade with the EU."" The government has said that it is ""confident"" that the delays at the Port of Dover will be resolved ""as quickly as possible."" However, the RHA said that the government's ""complacency"" is ""unacceptable."" Burnett said: ""The government has had months to prepare for this. It is simply not good enough to say that they are confident that the delays will be resolved. ""The government needs to take action now to prevent this situation from getting even worse.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Air pollution: Houses on polluted street face demolition,"Air pollution: Houses on polluted street face demolition Residents living on one of the UK's most polluted streets could have their homes demolished as part of a council's efforts to improve air quality and public health. Lambeth Council in south London is considering demolishing four Victorian houses on Brixton Road, which has been identified as having some of the worst air pollution in the country. The council says the demolition of the houses would create a wider pavement, allowing more space for pedestrians and cyclists, and would also improve air flow along the street. The council is also proposing to introduce a number of other measures to reduce air pollution on Brixton Road, including: Reducing the speed limit to 20mph Introducing a new bus lane Planting more trees Installing air quality monitors The council says that the measures are necessary to protect the health of residents, as air pollution has been linked to a number of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. The council's proposals have been met with mixed reactions from residents. Some residents have welcomed the plans, saying that they believe the measures will improve the air quality and make the street safer for pedestrians and cyclists. However, other residents have expressed concerns about the plans, saying that they believe the demolition of the houses is unnecessary and that the council should focus on other measures to reduce air pollution. The council is currently consulting on its proposals and will make a final decision on whether to proceed with the demolition of the houses later this year. Air pollution is a major problem in the UK, with an estimated 40,000 deaths each year being attributed to exposure to air pollution. The government has committed to reducing air pollution levels in the UK, and has introduced a number of measures to achieve this, including: Setting legal limits for air pollution Investing in cleaner transport Promoting energy efficiency Encouraging walking and cycling The government's air quality strategy is also aimed at reducing air pollution levels in the UK by 2030.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Drug mule cat gets caught in Russian jail,"In a bizarre twist of fate, a cat named Busya has become an unlikely member of an international drug smuggling ring. The unsuspecting feline was discovered carrying a small amount of drugs in a Russian prison, sending shockwaves through the facility. Busya, a stray cat that wandered into the prison grounds, was apprehended by guards after they noticed her unusual behavior. Upon closer inspection, they discovered a small package of narcotics concealed within the cat's collar. The discovery left the prison staff baffled and amused in equal measure. The incident has raised concerns about the extent to which animals may be used as unwitting couriers for illicit substances. Experts believe that drug traffickers may be exploiting the trusting nature of animals to smuggle drugs past security checkpoints. ""This is the first time we have heard of a cat being used as a drug mule,"" said a prison spokesperson. ""It's a very unusual and creative way to try to smuggle drugs into the prison."" The package of drugs found on Busya contained a small quantity of methamphetamine and heroin. The drugs were believed to be intended for inmates within the prison. ""We are investigating how the drugs got onto the cat and who may be responsible,"" said the spokesperson. ""We are taking this matter very seriously."" Busya has since been taken into custody by the prison authorities and is being held in a veterinary clinic for observation. The cat is said to be in good health and is not believed to have suffered any harm from the incident. The Russian authorities are now investigating the incident and are determined to find those responsible for using Busya as a drug mule. They are also considering implementing new measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The incident highlights the lengths to which drug smugglers will go to transport their illegal goods. It also raises questions about the welfare of animals that may be unwittingly involved in criminal activities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Row erupts after nine die in south-east Turkish bomb,"At least nine people have been killed and 27 injured in a car bomb explosion in the south-eastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir. The blast, which occurred in a busy commercial area, has been blamed on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK, which has been fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish minority, has denied responsibility. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to ""crush"" the group. The explosion, which occurred at around 11am local time (08:00 GMT), caused widespread panic and damage. Footage shared on social media showed thick black smoke billowing into the air, as well as the wreckage of cars and buildings. Ambulances and fire engines were quickly on the scene, and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals. The Turkish government has declared a state of emergency in the region, and security forces have been deployed to prevent further attacks. The PKK has been fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish minority for decades. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In recent years, the PKK has been designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. But the group's supporters argue that it is fighting for a just cause. The bombing in Diyarbakir is likely to further escalate tensions between the Turkish government and the PKK. It is also likely to increase pressure on the international community to take action to end the conflict. The United States and the European Union have both condemned the bombing, and have called on all parties to renounce violence. But it is unclear what further steps the international community can take to resolve the conflict. The Turkish government has been accused of human rights abuses in its crackdown on the PKK. But the PKK has also been accused of carrying out terrorist attacks. The conflict in south-eastern Turkey is a complex and long-running one. It is likely to continue for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Scottish deposit return scheme plan praised,"Scotland's Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) has been widely praised for its potential to significantly reduce litter and increase recycling rates. The scheme, which is set to launch in August 2023, will require retailers to charge a 20p deposit on all single-use drinks containers made of plastic, metal, or glass. Consumers will be able to get their deposit back when they return the empty container to a designated recycling point. The DRS has been in development for several years and has been the subject of extensive consultation with businesses, environmental groups, and the public. The Scottish government believes that the scheme will be a major step forward in tackling the problem of litter and waste. Environmental groups have welcomed the DRS, saying that it will help to reduce the number of plastic bottles and cans that are littered or landfilled. The scheme is also expected to increase recycling rates, as it will make it easier for people to recycle their drinks containers. Businesses have been more cautious about the DRS, expressing concerns about the cost of implementing the scheme and the potential for fraud. However, the Scottish government has said that it will provide financial support to businesses to help them implement the DRS. The DRS is part of a wider package of measures that the Scottish government is introducing to reduce litter and waste. The government has also introduced a ban on single-use plastic straws and cotton buds, and it is planning to introduce a tax on single-use plastic bags. The DRS is a bold and ambitious scheme, but it has the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing litter and waste in Scotland. The scheme is supported by a wide range of stakeholders, and it is expected to be a major success. In a statement, the Scottish government said: ""The Deposit Return Scheme is a key part of our plans to make Scotland a zero-waste society. The scheme will help to reduce litter, increase recycling rates, and create a more sustainable future for Scotland.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Brazilian press reacts to latest leaked tape scandal,"Brazilian Press Reacts to Latest Leaked Tape Scandal Brazilian media has erupted in outrage following the release of a leaked tape allegedly capturing former President Michel Temer negotiating bribes with a meatpacking executive. The scandal has reignited political turmoil in a country already grappling with corruption and economic crisis. Explosive Accusations On May 17, 2019, Brazilian news outlet ""O Globo"" published audio recordings purportedly showing Temer discussing illegal payments with Joesley Batista, former CEO of meatpacking giant JBS. In the tapes, Temer appears to be negotiating the purchase of the silence of another politician implicated in previous corruption scandals. Political Earthquake The leak has sent shockwaves through Brazilian politics. Temer's opponents have seized on the tapes as further evidence of his involvement in the massive ""Car Wash"" corruption investigation that has already ensnared dozens of high-profile figures. Temer denies any wrongdoing, but the scandal has raised questions about his credibility and the integrity of his administration. Media Outrage Brazilian media has been swift to condemn the allegations against Temer. Newspapers have run banner headlines denouncing the recordings as proof of ""rottenness"" at the heart of the government. Television networks have dedicated hours of coverage to the scandal, analyzing the tapes and interviewing experts. Public Fury The leaked tapes have also sparked widespread public anger. Brazilians are already disillusioned with their political leaders following years of corruption scandals. The latest revelations have further eroded trust in the government and raised fears of a return to the political instability that plagued the country in the past. Calls for Impeachment Opposition lawmakers have called for Temer's immediate impeachment. They argue that the tapes provide irrefutable evidence of corruption and that he is no longer fit to lead the country. However, Temer has enough support in Congress to block impeachment proceedings, and it is unclear if there is enough public pressure to force his removal from office. Fallout and Consequences The leaked tape scandal has had significant consequences. It has further weakened Temer's already fragile government and cast doubt on the legitimacy of his presidency. The scandal has also raised serious questions about the state of Brazilian politics and the country's ability to overcome its deep-seated corruption problem. As investigations continue and the fallout from the scandal unfolds, it remains to be seen how this latest crisis will shape the future of Brazil.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The musical has been in development for several years, and Lloyd Webber said he was ""thrilled"" to finally see it on stage. ""I'm so proud of this show,"" he said. ""It's a powerful and moving story, and I think it will really resonate with audiences."" The musical has been praised by critics, with The Guardian calling it ""a triumph"" and The Telegraph saying it is ""a must-see."" The cast includes Alexander Hanson as Stephen Ward, Charlotte Spencer as Christine Keeler, and Joshua James as John Profumo. The Profumo affair was a major political scandal that shook the British government in the early 1960s. It involved the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo, who had an affair with Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old model. Keeler was also involved with a Soviet naval attaché, which raised concerns about a security risk. The scandal led to Profumo's resignation and the downfall of the Conservative government. It also had a profound impact on British society, leading to a loss of trust in the establishment and a loosening of sexual mores. Lloyd Webber said he was drawn to the story of Stephen Ward because it was ""such a tragedy."" ""He was a brilliant man who was destroyed by the scandal,"" Lloyd Webber said. ""I wanted to tell his story and to shed light on what happened."" The musical has been staged at the Aldwych Theatre in London, and is scheduled to run until November 5th. Lloyd Webber said he hoped the musical would help to raise awareness of the Profumo affair and its impact on British society. ""I think it's important to remember what happened,"" he said.

""And we need to make the Assembly more representative of the people we represent."" Fearon's comments come as the Assembly is facing a number of challenges, including the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the recent collapse of the power-sharing government.

Venezuela opposition wins EU's top human rights prize,"Venezuela Opposition Wins EU's Top Human Rights Prize The European Union (EU) has awarded its prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Venezuelan opposition, recognising their ""courageous and tireless efforts"" against President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime. The prize was accepted on behalf of the opposition by Juan Guaidó, the self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela, who has been a vocal critic of Maduro. In a statement, the EU Parliament said: ""The opposition has consistently defended democracy, the rule of law and human rights."" ""Despite the regime's repression and persecution, they have remained steadfast in their commitment to a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in Venezuela."" The opposition has been fighting for years against Maduro's regime, which has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The Sakharov Prize, named after the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, is awarded annually to individuals or organisations that have made an exceptional contribution to the promotion of human rights and democracy. Past winners include Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, and Malala Yousafzai. The EU's award to the Venezuelan opposition is a significant recognition of their struggle and a clear message of support from the international community. The opposition has welcomed the award, saying it is a ""recognition of the courage and determination of the Venezuelan people."" ""We will not rest until we have achieved our goal of a free and democratic Venezuela,"" said Guaidó. The Maduro regime has dismissed the award as ""interference"" in Venezuela's internal affairs. The EU's decision to award the Sakharov Prize to the Venezuelan opposition is likely to further strain relations between the bloc and Maduro's regime. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Venezuela, and has called for the release of political prisoners and the restoration of democracy. The Maduro regime has accused the EU of supporting the opposition's ""coup attempt"" and of trying to undermine his government.

Private schools extend lead in entrants to university,"Private schools have further extended their lead in terms of university entrants, with nearly a quarter (23.4%) of all pupils accepted onto degree courses in 2022, compared to just 14.6% in 2019. This widening gap highlights the ongoing advantages enjoyed by those from more affluent backgrounds when it comes to accessing higher education. The figures, released by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), show that the proportion of private school pupils accepted into university has increased by 1.8 percentage points since 2019, while the proportion of state school pupils has fallen by 0.6 percentage points. This means that private school pupils are now more than twice as likely to go to university as state school pupils. The gap is particularly pronounced in the most selective universities, with 43.5% of private school pupils accepted into Russell Group universities in 2022, compared to just 18.9% of state school pupils. This means that private school pupils are now more than twice as likely to go to a Russell Group university as state school pupils. There are a number of factors that contribute to this gap, including: Funding: Private schools have significantly more funding than state schools, which allows them to provide smaller class sizes, better facilities, and more extracurricular activities. This can give private school pupils a significant advantage in terms of academic achievement. Selection: Private schools are able to select their pupils, which means that they can admit pupils who are more likely to succeed academically. This can also contribute to the gap in university entrance rates. Culture: Private schools often have a culture of academic achievement, which can motivate pupils to work harder and achieve better grades. This can also contribute to the gap in university entrance rates. The widening gap in university entrance rates is a concern, as it means that pupils from less affluent backgrounds are less likely to have the opportunity to access higher education. This can have a significant impact on their future life chances. There are a number of things that can be done to address this gap, including: Increasing funding for state schools: State schools need to be given more funding so that they can provide the same quality of education as private schools. This would help to level the playing field for pupils from all backgrounds. Reforming school admissions: The school admissions system needs to be reformed so that it is fairer to pupils from all backgrounds. This could involve abolishing private school selection or introducing a system of quotas for state school pupils in selective schools. Changing the culture of schools: Schools need to change their culture so that they value academic achievement for all pupils, regardless of their background. This could involve setting higher expectations for all pupils and providing more support for pupils who are struggling. By addressing the factors that contribute to the gap in university entrance rates, we can help to create a more level playing field for pupils from all backgrounds and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed in higher education.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The bid, which is for a 50-year concession, includes the ports of Calais, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and Dunkerque. If successful, Groupe Eurotunnel would become the largest port operator in Northern France, with an annual traffic volume of approximately 25 million passengers and 6 million tonnes of freight. The company believes that the acquisition would allow it to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and enhance services for customers. The French government has launched a tender process for the concession, which is expected to close in the coming months. Groupe Eurotunnel faces competition from several other international port operators, including DP World, PSA International, and Bolloré Ports. The acquisition of the French ports would be a major strategic move for Groupe Eurotunnel, which has been seeking to diversify its revenue streams and expand its presence in the European port market. The company currently operates ports in the United Kingdom, Dover, and Folkestone, and has been exploring opportunities to expand its operations in France for several years. Analysts believe that the French ports offer significant growth potential, particularly in the areas of freight and logistics. The ports are well-positioned to serve the growing trade between the United Kingdom and the European continent, and they have the potential to develop into major hubs for the distribution of goods. Groupe Eurotunnel has a strong track record in port management and operations, and it is well-respected in the industry. The company has a proven ability to deliver high-quality services and to innovate in order to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The vast majority of the deaths have been in the coastal province of Guayas, which includes the city of Guayaquil. The province has been the epicentre of the outbreak in Ecuador, and has accounted for more than half of the country's total deaths. The surge in deaths has overwhelmed the healthcare system in Guayas, with hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of patients. Many people have died at home or in the streets, as they were unable to get access to medical care. The Ecuadorian government has imposed a nationwide lockdown in an attempt to contain the virus, but the measures have been difficult to enforce in Guayas. The province is home to many poor and informal workers, who have been unable to stay home and lose income. The government has also been criticised for its handling of the crisis, with many accusing it of being slow to react to the outbreak. The surge in deaths in Ecuador is a reminder of the devastating impact that the coronavirus pandemic can have. It is also a warning to other countries that are still struggling to contain the virus. Analysis The surge in deaths in Ecuador is a major concern, and it is likely to put a strain on the country's healthcare system. The government is facing a difficult challenge in trying to contain the virus, as it is difficult to enforce lockdown measures in a poor and densely populated country. The international community should provide assistance to Ecuador, as it is struggling to cope with the crisis. This assistance could include financial aid, medical supplies, and technical expertise. It is also important to learn from the mistakes that have been made in Ecuador. Other countries should take steps to ensure that they have a robust healthcare system in place, and that they are prepared to respond to a major outbreak of the virus.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly numbers boost,"The small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly is a rare and threatened species that has seen a significant boost in numbers thanks to conservation efforts. The butterfly, which is found in damp meadows and marshes, has suffered from habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as changes in land management practices. As a result, its numbers have declined significantly in recent decades. However, thanks to the work of conservationists, the small pearl-bordered fritillary is now making a comeback. In the UK, the Butterfly Conservation charity has been working with landowners and farmers to create and restore habitats for the butterfly. This has included planting wildflowers, managing grazing and mowing practices, and reducing the use of pesticides. As a result of these efforts, the small pearl-bordered fritillary is now starting to recolonise areas where it was once extinct. In 2022, the butterfly was recorded in 10 new sites in the UK, the highest number of new records in a single year since the charity began monitoring the species in 1976. Dr Richard Fox, head of science at Butterfly Conservation, said: ""This is fantastic news for the small pearl-bordered fritillary. It shows that with the right conservation efforts, we can help to bring even the rarest species back from the brink of extinction."" The small pearl-bordered fritillary is a beautiful and important species. It plays a vital role in the ecosystem, pollinating plants and providing food for other animals. Its recovery is a testament to the power of conservation and the importance of working together to protect our wildlife. Here are some tips on how you can help the small pearl-bordered fritillary: - Create a wildlife-friendly garden by planting wildflowers and reducing the use of pesticides. - Support organisations that are working to protect the butterfly, such as Butterfly Conservation. - Visit meadows and marshes where the butterfly is known to occur and report any sightings to Butterfly Conservation.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent social services merger rejected,"Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent social services merger rejected Plans to merge the social services departments of Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent councils have been rejected by the Welsh Government. The merger was proposed as a way to save money and improve services, but the government said it had not been convinced that it would be in the best interests of the people of the two counties. The decision is a blow to the councils, which had been working on the merger for several years. They had argued that the merger would lead to a more efficient and effective social services department, and that it would save money that could be used to improve services. However, the government said it had not been convinced that the merger would achieve the desired outcomes. It said that there was no clear evidence that the merger would lead to significant savings, and that it could actually lead to a worse service for the people of the two counties. The government also said that it was concerned about the impact of the merger on the staff of the two councils. It said that the merger could lead to job losses and that it could also make it more difficult for staff to provide a high-quality service. The decision to reject the merger has been welcomed by some people, but it has also been criticized by others. Those who support the decision say that it is the right one for the people of the two counties, and that it will protect vital services. Those who criticize the decision say that it is a missed opportunity to improve services and that it will lead to a worse service for the people of the two counties. It is not yet clear what the next step will be for the two councils. They could decide to appeal the government's decision, or they could decide to abandon the merger plans altogether. Whatever they decide, it is clear that the decision to reject the merger will have a significant impact on the social services departments of the two counties.

Egypt explosion: Tourists on bus injured near Giza pyramids,"Tourists were injured in a bus explosion near Egypt's iconic Giza pyramids on Saturday, the health ministry has said. Two people were killed and at least 12 others were injured on the bus, which was carrying tourists from South Africa. The blast occurred as the bus was travelling along the road leading to the pyramids, officials said. Egypt's interior ministry said the explosion was caused by a homemade bomb placed under the bus, adding that it had begun an investigation into the incident. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The health ministry said the injured tourists were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Most of them are said to be in a stable condition. The Giza pyramids are one of Egypt's most popular tourist destinations. Millions of people visit the ancient structures each year. The explosion comes as Egypt's tourism industry is struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused a sharp decline in visitor numbers. The country is hoping to boost its tourism revenue by promoting new tourist attractions, such as the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is set to open later this year. The attack is a reminder of the security challenges that Egypt faces. The country has been battling an insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula for years. In recent months, there have also been several attacks on Coptic Christian churches in the country. The UK Foreign Office has advised British nationals to avoid the area around the Giza pyramids. It has also advised against all but essential travel to Egypt. The explosion has been condemned by world leaders. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news of the attack. He called for those responsible to be brought to justice. US President Joe Biden said the attack was ""a cowardly act of violence against innocent civilians."" He said the US stands with Egypt in its fight against terrorism. The Egyptian government has vowed to bring those responsible for the attack to justice. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said the attack would not deter Egypt from continuing to fight terrorism. The explosion is a major blow to Egypt's tourism industry. It is likely to deter tourists from visiting the country, which could have a significant impact on the economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Ancrum Old Bridge rediscovered beneath the River Teviot,"Nestled amidst the picturesque Scottish Borders, the River Teviot has long hidden a secret beneath its tranquil waters. Ancrum Old Bridge, a centuries-old structure, has lain submerged for decades, its existence fading into the annals of history. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of local historians and archaeologists, this lost relic has been rediscovered, offering a glimpse into the region's rich past. The bridge's origins can be traced back to the 16th century, when it served as a vital crossing point for travelers and goods. Constructed of massive stone blocks, it spanned the river with a single, graceful arch. Over the centuries, the bridge bore witness to countless events, from the passage of armies to the bustling trade that flourished along the river. However, in the mid-19th century, tragedy struck. A devastating flood ravaged the area, sweeping away the bridge and burying it beneath layers of silt and debris. For over a century, it remained concealed, its existence known only through local folklore and faded records. In recent years, a renewed interest in the bridge's fate emerged. Local historian John Foreman, driven by a deep fascination with the region's past, began searching for clues to its whereabouts. Through meticulous research and collaboration with archaeologists, he gradually pieced together the puzzle of the lost bridge. Armed with sonar equipment and a team of volunteers, Foreman embarked on a series of underwater surveys. To their astonishment, they discovered the bridge's remains lying intact beneath the riverbed. The stone arch, remarkably well-preserved, testified to the bridge's enduring resilience. The rediscovery of Ancrum Old Bridge has sparked great excitement among historians and heritage enthusiasts. It provides tangible evidence of the region's vibrant past and offers a window into the lives of those who crossed it centuries ago. Plans are now underway to excavate the bridge and restore it to its former glory, creating a unique historical attraction that will further enrich the cultural heritage of the Scottish Borders. As the waters of the River Teviot gently flow over the rediscovered bridge, they carry with them the echoes of history. Ancrum Old Bridge, once lost to time, has now re-emerged as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the past and the enduring power of human connection.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Amphibian that buries head in sand named after Donald Trump,"In a peculiar twist of nomenclature, a newly discovered species of amphibian has been named after former US President Donald Trump. The creature, a burrowing frog native to Panama, has earned the scientific moniker ""Atelopus trumpi"" due to a striking resemblance between its head and the former leader's distinctive hairstyle. Scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute stumbled upon the frog during an expedition in the remote rainforests of western Panama. Its unusual appearance, characterized by a bulbous head and a prominent orange crest, immediately caught their attention. As they observed the frog's behavior, they noticed a peculiar habit: when threatened, it would bury its head in the sand, leaving only its eyes and nostrils exposed. This defensive mechanism, known as ""concealing crypsis,"" is common among amphibians and reptiles. However, the frog's distinctive head shape and habit of burying its head in the sand were so reminiscent of Donald Trump's appearance and his signature hand gesture that the scientists couldn't resist bestowing the presidential namesake upon it. ""We wanted to highlight the importance of amphibians and conservation, and we thought naming this species after a well-known figure would draw attention to their plight,"" explained Dr. Brian Gratwicke, one of the scientists involved in the discovery. The newly named ""Atelopus trumpi"" is a small, terrestrial frog that measures about 3 centimeters in length. It has a dark brown back with bright orange markings on its limbs and head. Its natural habitat is the rainforest streams of western Panama, where it feeds on insects and other small invertebrates. While the frog's scientific name may elicit some chuckles, the scientists hope that it will serve as a reminder of the importance of amphibian conservation. Amphibians are facing numerous threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and pollution. The naming of ""Atelopus trumpi"" is a playful way to raise awareness about these threats and the need to protect these delicate creatures. So, next time you hear about Donald Trump, remember that he has an amphibian namesake – a small, burrowing frog that spends its days buried in the sands of Panama. It's a quirky and unexpected connection between the worlds of politics and nature, a testament to the diversity and wonder of the natural world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Reality Check: How are English councils spending your taxes?,"Reality Check: How are English councils spending your taxes? Every year, local authorities in England receive billions of pounds from taxpayers to provide essential services such as education, social care and waste collection. But how efficiently is this money being spent? A recent study by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that English councils spent a total of £108 billion in 2021/22. Of this, the largest proportion (35%) was spent on education, followed by social care (23%) and highways maintenance (10%). However, there were significant variations in spending between different councils. For example, the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea spent £1,800 per person on social care, while the Isle of Wight Council spent just £800. The LGA's study also found that councils are facing increasing financial pressures. In 2021/22, they received £15 billion less in government funding than they did in 2010/11. This has led to cuts in services and increased council tax bills. So, what can be done to improve the efficiency of council spending? The LGA has called for the government to provide more funding to local authorities. It has also suggested that councils should be given more freedom to raise their own revenue. Some councils are already taking steps to improve their efficiency. For example, the London Borough of Sutton has introduced a ""digital first"" approach, which has reduced the cost of providing services by 20%. The LGA's study provides a valuable insight into how English councils are spending their money. It is clear that there is room for improvement, but councils are also facing significant financial challenges. The government needs to work with councils to find ways to improve efficiency and ensure that essential services are protected. Here are some tips for how you can find out how your local council is spending your taxes: Check your council's website. Most councils publish their budgets and financial statements online. Attend your local council meetings. This is a good way to hear from councilors and officers about how your money is being spent. Contact your local council directly. You can usually find contact details on your council's website. By being informed about how your council is spending your taxes, you can hold them to account and help to ensure that your money is being used wisely.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis inquest to explore heading link,"Former footballer Alan Jarvis died at the age of 44 due to a brain condition. An inquest has determined that the cause of death was a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated heading of footballs. Alan Jarvis played for various English football clubs, including Norwich City, Luton Town, and Cambridge United. He underwent a post-mortem examination which revealed he had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease that is linked to repetitive head trauma. The inquest heard that Jarvis had been experiencing a range of symptoms, including memory loss, aggression, confusion, mood swings, and depression. His wife, Donna Jarvis, stated that these symptoms began while he was still playing football. She said that he had been ""a different man"" after heading the ball. The coroner, Claire Welch, concluded that Jarvis' death was a direct result of heading footballs. She said that the evidence showed that he had sustained multiple head injuries during his career as a professional footballer. These injuries had led to the development of CTE, which ultimately caused his death. The inquest is the first time that a coroner in England has directly linked heading footballs to the death of a former player. The findings of the inquest are likely to put pressure on football authorities to take action to reduce the risks of head injuries in the sport. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said the inquest was a ""landmark moment"" in the understanding of the risks of heading footballs. The PFA called for football authorities to introduce new rules to limit the number of headers that players are allowed to make in training and matches. The Football Association (FA) said it was ""deeply saddened"" by Jarvis' death and that it was committed to taking action to reduce the risks of head injuries in football. The FA said it was working with other football organisations to develop new rules and guidelines to protect players. The inquest into Alan Jarvis' death has highlighted the serious risks of head injuries in football.

"Schools need support not blame from Ofsted, says head","Ofsted's latest report on the state of education in England has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the report's findings, which highlight the need for urgent improvement in many schools. Others have criticized the report for being too negative and for failing to recognize the progress that has been made in recent years. One of the most controversial aspects of the report is its focus on the role of headteachers. The report finds that many headteachers are not doing enough to improve the quality of teaching and learning in their schools. This has led to calls for Ofsted to take a tougher stance on underperforming headteachers. However, some headteachers have argued that they need more support from Ofsted, not more blame. They say that Ofsted's current inspection regime is too focused on short-term targets and does not take into account the challenges that schools face. They also say that Ofsted's inspectors are often too quick to criticize headteachers without offering any constructive feedback. One headteacher who has spoken out against Ofsted is Sally Coates, the headteacher of St Anne's Primary School in London. Coates says that Ofsted's inspections are ""damaging"" and that they do not help schools to improve. She says that Ofsted should focus on providing support to schools, rather than on blaming headteachers. ""Ofsted needs to change its approach,"" said Coates. ""It needs to stop blaming headteachers and start working with them to improve the quality of education in our schools."" Coates's views are echoed by many other headteachers. A recent survey by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) found that 70% of headteachers believe that Ofsted's inspections are not helpful. The NAHT is calling for Ofsted to reform its inspection regime and to focus on providing support to schools. The debate about the role of Ofsted is likely to continue for some time. However, it is clear that many headteachers believe that they need more support from Ofsted, not more blame. If Ofsted is to be effective in improving the quality of education in England, it will need to listen to the concerns of headteachers and work with them to find solutions to the challenges that schools face.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The RCP says that estate agents have a duty to inform buyers about potential risks to their health, and that this includes air pollution. ""Estate agents have a responsibility to make sure that buyers are aware of all the relevant information about a property before they make a decision,"" said Professor Stephen Holgate, chairman of the RCP's working group on air pollution. ""This includes information about air pollution levels in the area, and the potential health risks associated with exposure to air pollution.""

The study found that people who lived in areas with the highest levels of air pollution were 40% more likely to develop dementia than those who lived in areas with the lowest levels of air pollution. The RCP says that the study's findings are ""concerning"" and that they highlight the need for estate agents to inform buyers about air pollution levels. ""Air pollution is a serious public health problem, and it is important that buyers are aware of the risks associated with exposure to air pollution,"" said Professor Holgate. ""Estate agents have a duty to make sure that buyers are aware of all the relevant information about a property before they make a decision, and this includes information about air pollution levels."" The RCP is calling on the government to introduce new regulations that would require estate agents to tell buyers about air pollution levels.

John Boyega says father was stopped by police on way from church,"John Boyega, the 'Star Wars' actor, has revealed that his father was stopped by police for driving while black on his way home from church. Boyega, 27, said his father was pulled over by police in London in 2018. He said the incident left his father ""traumatized"" and ""humiliated."" ""My dad was driving back from church and he was pulled over by the police,"" Boyega told GQ magazine. ""He was driving a nice car and he was dressed smartly. He had just come from church. ""The police officer asked him where he was going and he said he was coming from church. The police officer then asked him for his ID and he gave it to him. ""The police officer then asked him to step out of the car and he did. The police officer then searched him and his car. ""My dad was humiliated. He was traumatized. He felt like he was being treated like a criminal. He didn't do anything wrong. He was just driving home from church."" Boyega said the incident made him realize that racism is still a problem in the UK. ""It's not just about police brutality,"" he said. ""It's about the everyday racism that black people face. ""We're constantly being stopped and searched. We're constantly being followed around shops. We're constantly being treated like we're criminals. ""It's not right. It's not fair. It's not just. ""We need to do more to fight racism. We need to do more to educate people about racism. We need to do more to hold the police accountable for their actions."" Boyega's comments come amid growing concerns about racial profiling by the police in the UK. A report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2019 found that black people in the UK are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. The report also found that black people are more likely to be arrested and charged than white people. Boyega's father's experience is a reminder that racism is still a problem in the UK. It is a problem that needs to be addressed.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Fewest firms planning job cuts since pandemic began,"The number of UK firms planning to make redundancies has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a survey suggests. The latest quarterly Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG report found that 18% of companies are considering cutting jobs in the coming months, down from 22% in the previous quarter. The survey also found that the number of permanent placements made by recruiters rose by 22% in the three months to September, the fastest pace of growth since before the pandemic. The findings suggest that the UK labor market is continuing to recover from the impact of the pandemic, but that some businesses are still facing challenges. The REC's chief executive, Neil Carberry, said: ""The labor market remains tight, with employers continuing to struggle to fill roles. This is good news for jobseekers, but it is also a challenge for businesses. ""The fall in the number of firms planning redundancies is a welcome sign, but it is important to remember that many businesses are still struggling. The government needs to do more to support businesses and help them to create jobs."" The KPMG UK head of employers, Claire Kennedy, said: ""The UK labor market is showing signs of recovery, but there are still challenges ahead. The rise in the number of permanent placements is a positive sign, but the number of firms planning redundancies remains high. ""The government needs to continue to support businesses and help them to create jobs. This will be essential for ensuring that the UK economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic."" The REC and KPMG report is based on a survey of 600 employers in the UK. The survey was conducted in September 2021. Key findings: 18% of companies are considering cutting jobs in the coming months, down from 22% in the previous quarter.

Criggion museum bid for ex-WW2 and Cold War centre,"Criggion Museum Bid for Ex-WW2 and Cold War Centre A museum in Wales is bidding to take over an abandoned ex-World War Two and Cold War centre. Criggion Museum in Powys has submitted an ambitious bid to the Ministry of Defence to acquire the former RAF base at Llanbedr, near Harlech. The museum is aiming to transform the site into a major visitor attraction, showcasing the history of the base and its role in both conflicts. The proposal includes plans for a new exhibition centre, a research facility, and a visitor centre. If successful, the bid would be a major boost for the museum, which currently houses a collection of over 20,000 artefacts from the two wars. The acquisition of the Llanbedr site would provide the museum with much-needed space to expand its collection and create a world-class visitor experience. The Llanbedr base was first established in 1940 as a training ground for RAF pilots during World War Two. It later became home to the No. 207 Squadron, which flew reconnaissance missions over Europe. The base was also used as a staging post for aircraft flying to and from the Mediterranean and the Far East. After the war, the base was used by the Royal Observer Corps, which monitored aircraft movements during the Cold War. It was finally closed in 1995. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that it is considering the museum's bid. A decision is expected later this year. If successful, the museum will work with local partners to develop the site into a major tourist destination. The project is expected to create new jobs and boost the local economy. The museum's bid has been welcomed by local politicians and businesses. Arfon Jones, MS for Arfon, said: ""This is a fantastic opportunity to create a world-class visitor attraction in North Wales. The museum's bid has my full support."" Geraint Evans, owner of the Plas Tan-Yr-Allt Hotel in Llanbedr, said: ""The museum's plans are very exciting. This would be a major boost for the local economy and would attract visitors from all over the world."" The museum's bid is part of a wider effort to preserve and promote the history of Wales' role in the two world wars. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the country's military heritage, with a number of new museums and memorials being opened.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Guernsey sets reclaiming support threshold at £50k,"Covid-19: Guernsey sets reclaiming support threshold at £50k The States of Guernsey has agreed to reclaim Covid-19 financial support from businesses with profits over £50,000. It follows criticism that some businesses were claiming support they did not need. The income support scheme, which paid businesses a percentage of lost earnings during the pandemic, has now closed. The States said it had ""reluctantly"" made the decision after ""careful consideration"". It added that it was ""currently reviewing"" other Covid-19 financial support schemes to ensure ""equitable support for businesses"". The States said that businesses with taxable income over £50,000 in 2019 and 2020 would have to repay any grant funding they received from the business disruption loan guarantee, co-funded payroll and income support schemes. Businesses will have to submit an online form to the States by 30 September to declare their profits. Loans under the business disruption loan guarantee scheme will be converted to loans at commercial interest rates, the States said. Deputy Mark Helyar, president of the Committee for Economic Development, said the States had been ""very clear from the outset that support was not available to those businesses which were able to trade profitably"". ""The States has provided significant financial support to our businesses throughout the pandemic to support jobs and livelihoods,"" he said. ""In order to meet the value for money and fairness principles that apply to public funds, it is right that we reclaim this support where businesses have not incurred financial hardship as a result of Covid-19."" The Guernsey Chamber of Commerce said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision. ""We believe that the States could find a better way to claw back this money,"" said chief executive Elaine Gray. ""We have made suggestions and other jurisdictions have set other thresholds so we are slightly disappointed with that."" However, the Institute of Directors (IoD) in Guernsey said it ""appreciated"" the States' decision. ""The IoD has always maintained that those businesses which do not need financial support should not take it,"" said chairman Peter Mills. ""We therefore appreciate the States' decision to reclaim grants from those businesses with profits of over £50,000 in 2019 and 2020."" Additional information The income support scheme paid businesses up to 80% of their lost earnings during the pandemic. The business disruption loan guarantee scheme provided loans of up to £500,000 to businesses affected by the pandemic. The co-funded payroll scheme paid businesses 60% of the salaries of furloughed staff during the pandemic.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Microbreweries 'the way forward' after 11 open in year,"Microbreweries: The Way Forward After 11 Open in Year The microbrewing industry in the UK is booming, with 11 new breweries opening in the past year alone. This surge in popularity is being driven by a growing demand for craft beer, as consumers become increasingly interested in local, independent, and high-quality beverages. Microbreweries are typically small-scale operations that produce limited quantities of beer, often using traditional brewing methods. They are often passionate about their craft, and they take pride in creating unique and flavorful beers that reflect their local heritage and brewing styles. The growth of the microbrewing industry is good news for consumers, as it provides them with a wider choice of beers to enjoy. It is also good news for the economy, as it creates jobs and supports local businesses. However, the microbrewing industry is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is competition from large, multinational brewing companies. These companies have vast resources and marketing budgets, which can make it difficult for microbreweries to compete. Another challenge is the cost of production. Microbreweries often have to pay more for ingredients and equipment than large breweries. This can make it difficult for them to keep their prices competitive. Despite these challenges, the microbrewing industry is well-positioned for continued growth. Consumers are increasingly interested in craft beer, and they are willing to pay a premium for it. This provides microbreweries with a strong foundation for success. In order to continue to grow, microbreweries need to focus on producing high-quality beer, building strong relationships with their customers, and marketing their products effectively. They also need to be aware of the challenges they face and be prepared to adapt to the changing market. If they can do these things, microbreweries will be well-positioned to continue to thrive in the years to come. Here are some of the key factors that are driving the growth of the microbrewing industry: Growing demand for craft beer: Consumers are increasingly interested in local, independent, and high-quality beverages. This is driving demand for craft beer, which is often seen as being more flavorful and innovative than mass-produced beer. Increased availability of microbrewed beer: Microbrewed beer is now more widely available than ever before. It is sold in bars, restaurants, and bottle shops across the UK. This makes it easy for consumers to find and try new craft beers. Government support: The government has been supportive of the microbrewing industry, providing grants and loans to help businesses get started. This support has helped to create a favorable environment for microbreweries to grow and thrive. The future of the microbrewing industry looks bright. As demand for craft beer continues to grow, microbreweries will be well-positioned to continue to grow and thrive.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Bovis says it will fix home faults by end of 2017,"Bovis says it will fix home faults by end of 2017 Housebuilder Bovis Homes has said it will fix all outstanding faults in its homes by the end of the year. The company was fined £10.6m earlier this month after admitting its homes were ""defective"". Bovis said it had now written to all 2,662 customers who had bought homes from it since the start of 2016. It said it had identified 2,045 properties with 9,379 faults, and that 3,668 of these faults had already been fixed. Bovis said it had set up a new team of staff to deal with the repairs, and that it was working with independent building inspectors to ensure the work was carried out to a high standard. The company said it was ""confident"" that it would be able to fix all of the remaining faults by the end of the year. However, some homeowners have expressed doubts about whether Bovis will be able to meet this deadline. One homeowner, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that she had been waiting for repairs to her home for over a year. She said: ""I'm very sceptical about whether Bovis will be able to fix all of the faults by the end of the year. ""I've been waiting for repairs for over a year now, and I've had no communication from Bovis for months."" Bovis said it understood that some homeowners were frustrated, but it insisted that it was committed to fixing all of the outstanding faults. A spokesman for the company said: ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience and distress that we have caused our customers. ""We are working hard to put things right, and we are confident that we will be able to fix all of the remaining faults by the end of the year."" The Consumer Rights Act 2015 gives homeowners the right to a repair, replacement or refund if they find faults with their new home within six years of moving in. If a developer refuses to fix the faults, homeowners can take them to court.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Boston Tapes: Ex-IRA man loses fight over secret tapes,"Former IRA commander Gerry Adams has lost his legal battle to prevent the release of secret tapes thought to contain conversations about his alleged role in the murder of Jean McConville. The tapes were made by an unknown source during a series of interviews in the early 2000s with former IRA members Dolours Price and Brendan Hughes. Price, a leading member of a known IRA ""unofficial"" unit called ""The Unknowns,"" turned herself in to the authorities and confessed to her role in the 1972 abduction and murder of the widowed mother-of-10 shortly before she died of cancer in 2013. Hughes was also a leading member of the IRA, and he was sentenced to twelve years in prison in 1981 as one of the masterminds behind the bombing of a British Army base in Warrenpoint, County Down. He died following a short illness in 2008. Adams has always denied any involvement in the murder of Jean McConville, and his lawyers argued that the tapes should not be released as they had been obtained illegally. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the public interest in hearing the tapes outweighed any privacy concerns, and they will now be released to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Adams has said that he will not listen to the tapes, but he has vowed to continue to fight to clear his name. He said that the tapes were ""a fabrication"" and that he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by the British government and media. ""I have nothing to hide,"" he said. ""I am innocent of any wrongdoing, and I will not let these tapes be used to rewrite history."" The PSNI has welcomed the Supreme Court's decision, and said that it will now review the tapes and decide whether they contain any evidence that could lead to criminal charges being brought against Adams. ""We are committed to investigating all allegations of wrongdoing, and we will follow the evidence wherever it leads,"" a PSNI spokesperson said. ""We are confident that the tapes will shed light on what happened to Jean McConville, and we will do everything we can to bring those responsible to justice."" The release of the tapes is a significant development in the ongoing investigation into the murder of Jean McConville, and it is likely to reignite the debate about Adams's role in the IRA. However, it is important to remember that Adams has not been charged with any crime, and he remains innocent until proven guilty.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Google faces French court claim over market dominance,"Google Faces French Court Claim Over Market Dominance Google is facing a legal challenge in France over allegations that it has abused its dominant position in the online advertising market. The lawsuit, filed by French competition authority Autorité de la concurrence, accuses the tech giant of favoring its own advertising services over those of rivals. The complaint alleges that Google's practices have stifled competition and harmed both consumers and businesses. Investigators claim that Google's exclusive deals with certain websites and its control over the auction process for online ads have given it an unfair advantage. The French competition watchdog is seeking a fine of up to 10% of Google's global revenue, which would amount to billions of euros. The authority has also ordered Google to change its practices within two months or face further penalties. Google has denied the allegations and vowed to defend itself vigorously in court. The company argues that its practices are fair and competitive and that it does not favor its own services. The lawsuit is a significant development in the ongoing scrutiny of Google's market power in Europe. Regulators in several countries have launched investigations into the company's practices, and Google has already faced fines in the European Union and the United States. The French case is particularly significant because it focuses specifically on the online advertising market. This market is hugely important for Google, which generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. If Google is found guilty of abusing its dominant position in the French market, it could set a precedent for further action in other countries. It could also lead to significant changes in the way Google operates its advertising business. The outcome of the case will be closely watched by businesses and regulators around the world. It could have a major impact on the future of online advertising and the competitive landscape of the tech sector.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Brexit law 'constitutionally insensitive' to Welsh Government,"The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the UK government acted ""unconstitutionally"" when it passed legislation that affected the powers of the Welsh Government without its consent. The case, brought by the Welsh Government, challenged the UK government's decision to impose a new tax on Welsh businesses without consulting with the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government argued that this was a breach of the devolution settlement, which gives Wales the power to make its own laws on certain matters. The Supreme Court agreed with the Welsh Government, ruling that the UK government had acted ""unconstitutionally"" by failing to consult with the Welsh Government before passing the legislation. The court said that this was a ""serious breach"" of the devolution settlement and that it had ""undermined the constitutional position of the Welsh Government"". The ruling is a significant victory for the Welsh Government and it will have implications for the future of devolution in the UK. It is clear that the UK government cannot simply impose its will on the devolved governments without their consent. The ruling is also a blow to the UK government's Brexit plans. The UK government has said that it wants to ""take back control"" from the EU and that it will be able to do this by passing new laws that will apply throughout the UK. However, the Supreme Court's ruling suggests that the UK government will not be able to do this without the consent of the devolved governments. The ruling has been welcomed by the Welsh Government. First Minister Mark Drakeford said that it was a ""landmark victory"" for the Welsh Government and that it would ""strengthen the devolution settlement"". The UK government has said that it is ""disappointed"" by the ruling. A government spokesperson said that the government ""respects the decision of the court"" but that it ""does not accept the characterisation of the legislation as unconstitutional"". The ruling is likely to have a significant impact on the UK government's Brexit plans.

The decision was reached during a high-level meeting held in New Delhi, where both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in combating transboundary crimes. The meeting was co-chaired by India's Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Bangladesh's Home Secretary Mostafa Kamal Uddin. During the discussions, the officials recognized the growing threat posed by wildlife smuggling and the urgent need to take collective action to protect endangered species. ""We have agreed to establish a joint mechanism to address cross-border crimes, including wildlife smuggling,"" said Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. ""This will enable us to share intelligence, coordinate operations, and take swift action against criminals involved in these illegal activities."" The joint mechanism is expected to facilitate regular communication and coordination between the two countries' law enforcement agencies. It will provide a platform for sharing information on wildlife smuggling routes, suspects, and seizure data. This cooperation is crucial for combating the illegal trade in wildlife, which threatens the survival of endangered species. ""Wildlife smuggling is a serious crime that not only depletes our natural resources but also undermines our economies,"" said Home Secretary Mostafa Kamal Uddin. ""By working together with India, we can effectively crack down on wildlife trafficking and protect our shared natural heritage."" The meeting also focused on other cross-border crimes, such as human trafficking, drug smuggling, and arms smuggling. Both sides emphasized the importance of strengthening border security and intelligence sharing to prevent and combat these illicit activities.

The FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 1.2% in early trading, while the pound gained 0.6% against the US dollar and 0.5% against the euro. The gains came after the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there had been ""progress"" in the talks, which resumed in London on Monday. Barnier said the two sides had reached an agreement on ""a significant part"" of the Withdrawal Agreement, which will set out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.

Health expert raises Cwmfelinfach waste site concern,"Health Expert Raises Concerns Over Cwmfelinfach Waste Site A leading health expert has expressed deep concern over the potential health risks posed by the Cwmfelinfach waste site in Carmarthenshire. Professor Jonathan Gibbs, a former president of the British Society for Ecological Medicine, has warned that the site could be releasing harmful chemicals into the environment, which could have serious consequences for the health of local residents. The Cwmfelinfach site, which is now a waste storage and treatment facility, was operated by the Monsanto chemical company from 1949 to 1999. During that time, it was used to store vast quantities of toxic chemicals, including PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls). PCBs are known carcinogens and can also cause a range of other health problems, including reproductive disorders, immune system dysfunction, and developmental issues in children. ""I am deeply concerned about the potential health risks posed by the Cwmfelinfach site,"" said Professor Gibbs. ""The fact that PCBs were stored there for so many years is a major cause for concern."" ""There is a real risk that these chemicals could be leaching into the soil and groundwater, and ultimately contaminating the local environment,"" he added. Professor Gibbs' concerns are echoed by local residents, who have reported a number of health problems in the area, including cancer, respiratory problems, and skin disorders. ""I have been living here for over 20 years and I have seen a lot of people get sick,"" said one resident, who asked not to be named. ""I am worried that the waste site is the cause."" The Environment Agency, which regulates the site, has said that it is monitoring the situation closely and that there is no evidence to suggest that the site is posing a health risk. However, Professor Gibbs believes that the agency is not doing enough to protect the public. ""The Environment Agency needs to carry out a full and independent assessment of the health risks posed by the site,"" he said. ""And if there is any evidence that the site is causing harm, then action needs to be taken to clean it up."" The Welsh government has said that it is aware of the concerns raised by Professor Gibbs and that it is working with the Environment Agency to investigate the matter.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
MH17 crash brings Ukraine conflict 'to West's door',"The downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine has brought the conflict in the country to the doorstep of Western nations. All 298 people on board the plane, including 193 Dutch citizens, were killed when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile on Thursday. The incident has been met with outrage and condemnation from around the world, with many pointing the finger of blame at pro-Russian separatists who have been fighting Ukrainian government forces in the east of the country. The crash has also raised serious questions about the future of the conflict in Ukraine. The West has been reluctant to intervene militarily, but the downing of MH17 may force them to reconsider their options. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the incident was a ""wake-up call"" for the West. ""This is not just a tragedy for the families and friends of the victims,"" he said. ""It is also a wake-up call for the international community. We cannot allow this conflict to continue to escalate.""  Rasmussen called on Russia to use its influence to de-escalate the situation and to help ensure that the perpetrators of the attack are brought to justice. ""We urge Russia to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine,"" he said. ""This includes withdrawing its support for the separatists and allowing international monitors to have full access to the crash site."" The downing of MH17 is a tragedy that has claimed the lives of innocent people. It is also a reminder of the dangers of the conflict in Ukraine and the need for a peaceful resolution. The West must now decide how to respond to this incident. Military intervention is one option, but it is a risky one that could lead to a wider conflict. The other option is to continue to pressure Russia to use its influence to de-escalate the situation. This is a more difficult path, but it is the one that is most likely to lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The downing of MH17 is a tragedy.

Russia bans Azerbaijani tomatoes over 'pesticide concerns',"Russia has banned imports of tomatoes from Azerbaijan due to concerns over the use of pesticides, the country's agricultural watchdog said on Friday. The ban, which took effect immediately, applies to all fresh and processed tomatoes from Azerbaijan, the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor) said in a statement. Rosselkhoznadzor said its decision was based on the results of laboratory tests, which found high levels of pesticides in Azerbaijani tomatoes. The agency said the levels of pesticides exceeded the maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), of which both Russia and Azerbaijan are members. The EAEU has established MRLs for a wide range of pesticides, which are based on scientific evidence and international standards. MRLs are the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue that is legally allowed in or on food or feed when pesticides are used according to good agricultural practices. Rosselkhoznadzor said it had repeatedly notified the Azerbaijani authorities of its concerns about the use of pesticides in tomatoes, but that no corrective action had been taken. The agency said it had therefore decided to impose the ban to protect Russian consumers from potential health risks. The ban on Azerbaijani tomatoes is likely to have a significant impact on the country's tomato industry. Azerbaijan is one of the largest producers of tomatoes in the region, and Russia is one of its main export markets. In 2021, Azerbaijan exported over 100,000 tonnes of tomatoes to Russia, according to data from the Azerbaijani State Customs Committee. The ban could cost Azerbaijani tomato growers millions of dollars in lost revenue. The Azerbaijani government has not yet commented on the ban. However, it is likely to challenge the decision, arguing that its tomatoes meet the required safety standards. The ban on Azerbaijani tomatoes is the latest in a series of trade disputes between Russia and its neighbors. In recent years, Russia has banned imports of a variety of products from Ukraine, Belarus, and other countries, citing concerns over quality and safety. These disputes have raised concerns about Russia's commitment to free trade and its use of trade restrictions as a political tool.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
BBC to argue for licence fee to be linked to inflation,"The BBC has announced plans to argue that its licence fee should be linked to inflation, a move that would see it rise by around £1.50 a year. The corporation is currently funded by a £159 annual licence fee, which is paid by all UK households that watch or record live TV. However, the fee has been frozen since 2010, and the BBC has warned that it is facing a funding crisis as a result. In a submission to the government's review of the licence fee, the BBC will argue that linking the fee to inflation is the only way to ensure that it has the resources it needs to continue providing high-quality public service broadcasting. The BBC says that the licence fee is a ""fair and efficient"" way of funding public service broadcasting, as it is paid by all households that benefit from the BBC's services. It also argues that the licence fee provides the BBC with a stable and independent source of income, which allows it to invest in high-quality programming and services. However, opponents of the BBC's plans have argued that linking the licence fee to inflation would be unfair to households that are already struggling to make ends meet.

"NI traveller community 'out of sight, out of mind'","NI traveller community: 'Out of sight, out of mind' The traveller community in Northern Ireland faces significant challenges and discrimination, often living on the margins of society. Despite constituting only a small percentage of the population, they experience high levels of poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of adequate housing. Many travellers live in unauthorised encampments or on roadside verges, often in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions. This lack of a stable home base has a detrimental impact on their health, education, and employment prospects. Another major challenge is discrimination. Travellers are frequently subjected to prejudice and hostility, both from individuals and institutions. They may be denied access to services, such as healthcare and education, or face harassment and intimidation. This discrimination creates a sense of isolation and exclusion, further marginalising the community. Furthermore, the traveller community often lacks political representation and a voice in decision-making. They are underrepresented in local councils and the Northern Ireland Assembly, which can lead to their needs and concerns being overlooked. The consequences of these challenges are far-reaching. Travellers have lower life expectancies and higher rates of chronic diseases than the general population. They are more likely to be unemployed, have lower educational attainment, and experience mental health problems. Despite these difficulties, the traveller community has shown resilience and a strong sense of identity. They have maintained their traditional culture and values, including a strong emphasis on family and community. However, they continue to face systemic barriers that prevent them from fully participating in society. Addressing the challenges faced by the traveller community requires a multifaceted approach. It involves providing adequate housing, combating discrimination, increasing political representation, and investing in education and employment opportunities. The government and society as a whole have a responsibility to ensure that travellers are treated with respect and dignity, and that they have the same opportunities as everyone else to live fulfilling and prosperous lives. Ignoring the needs of the traveller community is not only unjust but also short-sighted. By investing in their well-being, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society that benefits everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
World Chess Championship: Magnus Carlsen retains title,"Magnus Carlsen has retained his World Chess Championship title after defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in a tense tie-breaker. The Norwegian star won the rapid chess play-offs 3.5-2.5 to secure a fourth successive world title. The main 14-game match in Dubai had ended in a 7-7 draw, forcing the contest into a tie-breaker, where shorter time controls were used. Carlsen, 31, is now the second-longest reigning world champion in history, behind only Garry Kasparov, who held the title for 15 years. The Norwegian said: ""It's always a bit of a relief when you manage to win and it's a great feeling."" Despite starting the play-offs with a 1-0 advantage from the main match, Carlsen lost the first round to Nepomniachtchi. However, he levelled the scores in round two and then took the third game to establish a 2-1 lead heading into the afternoon session. Carlsen extended his advantage to 3-1 in the fourth game, leaving Nepomniachtchi needing to win both remaining games to force a sixth. The Russian managed to do just that, but Carlsen held on to draw the final game and secure the title. Nepomniachtchi, 31, said: ""Magnus is the strongest player on the planet. It's hard to beat him. ""I don't think I played a bad match. I had chances to win. But Magnus is just too strong."" Carlsen's victory means he remains the world's top-ranked player and extends his unbeaten streak to 125 games in classical chess. He is now set to face the winner of the Candidates Tournament in 2023 to defend his title once again.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New York sinkhole: Man's horror over fall into rat-infested chasm,"In a heart-stopping incident, a man in New York City has recounted his harrowing experience after falling into a rat-infested sinkhole. The victim, identified as 32-year-old John Smith, was walking through an alley in Midtown Manhattan when the ground beneath him suddenly gave way. Smith plunged into a six-foot-deep chasm, surrounded by swarms of rats. ""It was like something out of a nightmare,"" Smith told the BBC. ""I fell into this dark, damp hole, and there were rats everywhere. They were crawling over me, biting me, and I could hear them squealing and hissing."" Smith said he struggled to free himself from the rats and climb out of the sinkhole. ""I was terrified,"" he said. ""I thought I was going to die."" Finally, after several minutes of frantic struggle, Smith managed to pull himself out of the chasm and call for help. He was rushed to a nearby hospital with minor injuries, including rat bites and scratches. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has since inspected the sinkhole and determined that it was caused by a broken water main. The DEP has repaired the water main and filled in the sinkhole. However, Smith says the experience has left him traumatized. ""I can't get the image of those rats out of my head,"" he said. ""I keep having nightmares about them."" Smith's fall into the sinkhole has raised concerns about the safety of New York City's aging infrastructure. The city has thousands of miles of underground water mains, many of which are over a century old. ""This incident is a reminder that our city's infrastructure is in urgent need of repair,"" said Councilman Mark Levine, who represents the area where the sinkhole occurred. ""We need to invest in our water mains and other essential infrastructure to prevent these kinds of accidents from happening again."" The DEP says it is committed to maintaining and repairing the city's water infrastructure. The agency has a $1.5 billion annual budget for capital projects, including water main replacements.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Turkish bus attack: 13 off-duty soldiers killed by car bomb,"Turkish Bus Attack: 13 Off-Duty Soldiers Killed by Car Bomb At least 13 off-duty soldiers were killed and 55 others injured in a car bomb attack that targeted a military bus in Turkey's capital, Ankara. The incident occurred on Wednesday morning as the bus was carrying the soldiers to their base after they had finished their leave. According to initial reports, the bomb exploded near the bus stop in the central Ulus district. Turkish authorities have blamed the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant group designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, for the attack. The PKK has been fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish population for decades. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the attack as ""an act of terror,"" and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""This vile attack will not break the determination of our security forces,"" he said. The Turkish government has imposed a curfew on the Ulus district and launched a major security operation to track down those responsible for the bombing. Security forces have also detained several people for questioning. The attack has sparked widespread anger and condemnation in Turkey and around the world. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to the victims and their families. ""I strongly condemn the terrorist attack in Ankara. NATO stands in solidarity with Turkey and offers its full support to the Turkish authorities in the fight against terrorism,"" he said. The United States also condemned the attack, with Secretary of State John Kerry calling it ""a cowardly act of terrorism."" He said the US would continue to support Turkey in its efforts to combat the PKK. The bombing comes at a time of heightened tensions between Turkey and the PKK. The two sides resumed fighting last summer after a two-year ceasefire collapsed. The attack has raised fears that the violence in Turkey could escalate further. Turkey has been on high alert for terrorist attacks since the Islamic State group carried out a suicide bombing in Istanbul in January that killed 10 German tourists. The Turkish government has vowed to continue its crackdown on both the PKK and the Islamic State group, but analysts warn that the country faces a long and difficult struggle to end the violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Q&A: A4e row,"Q&A: A4e row What is A4e? A4e is a private company that provides employment and skills training services. It was founded in 1991 and is based in the UK. A4e has been awarded a number of government contracts to deliver welfare-to-work programmes. What is the row about?

Co-op Bank to shed 350 jobs and close branches,"The Co-op Bank is to cut 350 jobs and close 18 branches as part of a restructuring plan. The bank said the changes were necessary to ""create a sustainable business for the future"". The job losses will affect staff across the bank, including in its head office in Manchester. The branches that are closing are spread across the UK, including in London, Birmingham, and Glasgow. The Co-op Bank said it will support affected staff through the transition, including offering them redeployment opportunities. The bank's chief executive, Nick Slape, said: ""These changes are essential to create a sustainable business for the future. ""We understand that this is a difficult time for our colleagues and customers, and we are committed to supporting them through this transition."" The Co-op Bank has been facing financial difficulties in recent years. In 2017, it was rescued by a group of hedge funds after it failed to secure a capital injection from its parent company, The Co-operative Group. The bank has since been working to improve its financial performance, but it has continued to face challenges. The job losses and branch closures are the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures that the bank has implemented in recent months. The bank said it is ""confident"" that the restructuring plan will ""create a stronger and more sustainable business for the future"". However, the job losses and branch closures are likely to be a blow to the communities that they serve. The Co-op Bank is one of the UK's largest retail banks, with around 4.6 million customers. The bank has a strong presence in the north of England, where it has been based for over 150 years. The branch closures will leave many customers without a local branch of their bank. The Co-op Bank said it is committed to providing alternative banking services to affected customers, including through its online and mobile banking services.

Hillsborough trial: David Duckenfield case 'breathtakingly unfair',"In a ruling that has sent shockwaves through the legal community, the Court of Appeal has quashed the manslaughter conviction of former South Yorkshire Police match commander David Duckenfield. The decision has been met with widespread condemnation, with many branding it a ""breathtakingly unfair"" miscarriage of justice. Duckenfield was originally convicted in 2019 for his role in the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans were unlawfully killed during an FA Cup semi-final in 1989. The prosecution alleged that Duckenfield's decision to open a gate at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium, allowing thousands of fans to flood into an already overcrowded central pen, had created a ""crush"" that ultimately led to the deaths. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on a key aspect of the law, specifically the issue of gross negligence. The court found that the judge had failed to make it clear to the jury that they had to be sure that Duckenfield's actions had fallen ""far below"" the standard expected of a reasonable police officer in the same situation. The decision has been met with outrage by the families of the victims. Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said she was ""disgusted"" by the ruling and accused the court of ""letting the police off the hook."" Legal experts have also expressed concern about the implications of the decision. Professor David Ormerod, a criminal law expert at the University of Cambridge, said the ruling could make it harder to convict police officers of manslaughter in future cases. ""This decision sets a very high bar for proving gross negligence in cases involving police officers,"" he said. ""It will be very difficult for prosecutors to meet this standard in future cases, even in cases where there is clear evidence of wrongdoing."" The ruling is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the way in which police officers are held accountable for their actions. It could also make it more difficult for victims of police misconduct to seek justice through the courts. In light of the Court of Appeal's decision, it is now more important than ever that the government takes action to ensure that police officers are held accountable for their actions and that victims of police misconduct have access to justice.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Birth and death of stars captured by Very Large Telescope,"Nestled amidst the arid expanse of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, the Very Large Telescope (VLT) stands as a beacon of innovation and scientific discovery. This colossal observatory has recently captured breathtaking images of the birth and death of stars, providing invaluable insights into the celestial tapestry. Stellar Genesis: The Birth of Stars Within vast cosmic clouds of gas and dust, the seeds of new stars begin to germinate. Gravity draws together these primordial materials, forming dense cores that gradually ignite into incandescent orbs of fire. The VLT has captured these nascent stars in their earliest stages, revealing their intricate structures and the swirling chaos from which they emerge. These images showcase the remarkable diversity of stellar birth. Some stars arise as solitary entities, while others form in bustling clusters, where hundreds or even thousands of siblings crowd together. The VLT has unveiled intricate networks of filaments and jets emanating from these stellar nurseries, providing clues to the physical processes that drive their formation. Stellar Twilight: The Death of Stars At the opposite end of the cosmic hourglass lies the inevitable fate of all stars - death. As they exhaust their nuclear fuel, stars embark on their final transformation. The VLT has captured the spectacular demise of stars in various stages of their death throes. Red giants, bloated and incandescent, have shed their outer layers, creating mesmerizing planetary nebulae. These ethereal shells encompass the fading embers of the stars that once shone brightly. White dwarfs, the cooling remnants of once-massive stars, flicker like celestial embers against the backdrop of the cosmos. The most dramatic stellar death occurs when massive stars explode as supernovae. The VLT has witnessed these cataclysmic events in unprecedented detail, capturing the shockwaves that tear through interstellar space and the formation of neutron stars - the incredibly dense cores left behind after the explosion. A Cosmic Tapestry The images captured by the VLT not only document the birth and death of individual stars but also paint a broader picture of the cosmos. They reveal the cyclical nature of stellar evolution, where the remnants of dying stars become the building blocks for new celestial creations. These observations provide scientists with crucial information about the formation and evolution of galaxies, the distribution of heavy elements in the universe, and the fundamental processes that govern the vast cosmic tapestry. As the VLT continues its relentless search for answers, the mysteries of the universe unfold before our very eyes.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Social care cuts 'major cause' of A&E problems,"Social care cuts are a ""major cause"" of the problems facing A&E departments in England, according to a new report. The study, by the Nuffield Trust health think tank, found that the number of people being admitted to hospital from care homes has increased by 50% in the past decade. This is due to a combination of factors, including cuts to social care budgets, an aging population, and a rise in the number of people with complex health needs. The report warns that the situation is likely to get worse in the years to come, as the number of people over the age of 85 is set to double by 2030. This will put even more pressure on social care services and could lead to even more people being admitted to hospital unnecessarily. The authors of the report call for urgent action to address the crisis in social care. They say that the government needs to increase funding for social care and make it easier for people to access the care they need. They also call for a change in the way that social care is delivered, with a focus on providing more support in people's own homes. The report's findings are supported by a recent survey by the Care and Support Alliance, which found that 82% of care providers believe that cuts to social care budgets have made it more difficult for them to provide good quality care. The crisis in social care is having a knock-on effect on the NHS, which is already struggling to cope with rising demand. In 2017/18, there were over 24 million A&E attendances in England, an increase of 2% on the previous year. This has led to longer waiting times and overcrowding in A&E departments. The government has promised to increase funding for social care, but it is not clear whether this will be enough to address the crisis. The Nuffield Trust report calls for a long-term solution to the problem, with a focus on providing more support for people in their own homes. Without urgent action, the crisis in social care will continue to have a negative impact on the NHS and the lives of millions of people.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The revelation has sparked outrage among privacy advocates, who say that Facebook's actions amounted to a ""gross invasion of privacy."" They argue that voters have a right to know how their data is being used, and that Facebook should have been more transparent about its data collection practices. Facebook has defended its actions, saying that it only collected data from users who clicked on political ads. However, the company has admitted that it could have done more to make users aware of its data collection practices. The controversy comes at a time when Facebook is already facing intense scrutiny over its privacy practices. The company has been accused of mishandling user data in the past, and the latest revelation is likely to further erode public trust in the social media giant. In response to the backlash, Facebook has announced that it will make changes to its data collection practices. The company says that it will now require political advertisers to obtain users' consent before collecting their data. However, privacy advocates say that these changes do not go far enough. They argue that Facebook should delete all of the data it has collected from users who clicked on political ads. They also say that Facebook should be more transparent about its data collection practices and give users more control over how their data is used. The controversy over Facebook's data collection practices is likely to continue for some time. The company faces a number of legal challenges over its privacy practices, and it is possible that it could be forced to change its data collection practices in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"'It's Dr, not Ms,' insists historian","Despite the changing societal norms and the drive towards gender equality, a historian has asserted that she prefers to be addressed as ""Dr."" rather than ""Ms."" Dr. Amanda Foreman, known for her work on British history and her television documentaries, believes that the title ""Dr."" holds a significant value in academia and should be used to denote academic achievement. Foreman's stance has sparked a debate about the use of titles in professional settings, particularly for women. In an interview with The Telegraph, she explained, ""I've worked very hard for my doctorate, and I think it's important to be recognized for that."" She argued that the title ""Dr."" is not only a sign of respect but also an indicator of her expertise in her field. Some critics argue that the use of titles can perpetuate gender inequality. They point out that women are often expected to use their marital status in their titles, such as ""Mrs."" or ""Ms.,"" while men are typically addressed by their professional titles, such as ""Dr."" or ""Professor."" This distinction, they argue, reinforces the idea that women's identities are tied to their relationships with men. However, Foreman maintains that her preference for the title ""Dr."" is not a reflection of any desire to uphold gender norms. She emphasizes that she has earned her doctorate through years of study and research, and she believes that it is a legitimate recognition of her academic achievements. The debate over titles in professional settings is not new. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to encourage the use of gender-neutral titles, such as ""Mx."" or ""Professor,"" as a way to create a more inclusive environment for non-binary and transgender individuals. While some institutions have adopted gender-neutral titles, others have been slower to change. In academia, in particular, there is a long-standing tradition of using specific titles to denote different levels of seniority and achievement. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use a title is a personal one. Dr. Foreman's decision to use the title ""Dr."" reflects her own values and beliefs about the importance of recognizing academic achievement. While the debate over titles may continue, it is important to respect the choices of individuals and to create inclusive environments where all people feel valued and respected.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Facebook security app used to 'spy' on competitors,"In a shocking revelation, a security app developed by Facebook has been exposed for allegedly spying on the company's competitors. The app, known as Onavo Protect, was marketed as a tool to boost internet speeds and provide users with insights into their app usage. However, investigations have uncovered a sinister purpose behind its seemingly innocuous facade. Onavo Protect was reportedly used to gather vast amounts of data from users' mobile devices, including app usage information, location data, and even the content of private messages. This data was then analyzed by Facebook to pinpoint weaknesses in competing platforms and gain an unfair advantage. The revelation has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, raising concerns about privacy violations and the abuse of user data. Critics have accused Facebook of engaging in unethical practices and undermining the trust of its billions of users. According to whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, the company knew about the spying activities but chose to turn a blind eye. Haugen alleges that Facebook prioritized profit over user privacy, a claim that the company has vehemently denied. In response to the allegations, Facebook has suspended the distribution of Onavo Protect and pledged to cooperate with ongoing investigations. However, the damage to the company's reputation may already be too severe. TheOnavo Protect scandal has sparked a broader debate about the responsibilities of tech giants in protecting user privacy. Critics argue that companies like Facebook have grown too powerful and need to be held accountable for their actions. They call for stricter regulations and increased transparency to ensure that users are not exploited or their data misused. The fallout from the Onavo Protect revelations is far from over. Investigations are ongoing, and it remains to be seen what penalties or legal consequences Facebook may face. One thing is clear, however: the trust that users once had in the social media giant has been severely shaken. As the public demands accountability and the future of Facebook hangs in the balance, the tech industry and governments around the world are grappling with the challenge of balancing innovation with the protection of user privacy in an increasingly interconnected digital age.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New divorce form 'invites name and shame' of adulterers,"The government has unveiled a new divorce form that will invite couples to name and shame their adulterous partners. The move is part of a wider crackdown on infidelity, which the government believes is responsible for the breakdown of families and the rise in social problems. The new form will ask couples to state whether their marriage has broken down due to adultery. If so, they will be asked to provide the name and address of the third party involved. This information will then be passed on to the other spouse, who will be free to use it as they see fit. The government believes that the new form will help to deter adultery and make it easier for innocent spouses to rebuild their lives. However, critics have warned that the form could lead to a wave of revenge divorces and further damage already fragile relationships. They also argue that it is unfair to punish adulterers without giving them a chance to defend themselves. The government has defended the new form, saying that it is necessary to send a clear message that adultery is unacceptable. It also argues that the form is voluntary and that couples will not be forced to name their adulterous partners if they do not want to. The new form is expected to come into effect in the coming months. It is likely to prove controversial, but the government believes that it is a necessary step in tackling the problem of adultery. In addition to the new divorce form, the government is also considering a number of other measures to crack down on infidelity. These include introducing a new criminal offence of adultery, making it easier for innocent spouses to divorce their adulterous partners, and providing more support for victims of infidelity. The government's crackdown on infidelity is likely to be met with mixed reactions. Some will welcome it as a necessary step to protect families and relationships. Others will see it as an unnecessary intrusion into private lives. Only time will tell whether the government's new measures will be effective in reducing the incidence of adultery and improving the lives of those affected by it.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Emmerdale is 'booziest' soap, study suggests","Emmerdale has been labelled the ""booziest"" soap on British television, according to a new study. Researchers from the University of Liverpool analysed more than 1,000 episodes of Emmerdale, Coronation Street, EastEnders and Hollyoaks, and found that Emmerdale featured the highest number of scenes involving alcohol consumption. The study, published in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism, found that Emmerdale had an average of 10.6 scenes per episode involving alcohol, compared to 8.9 in Coronation Street, 7.8 in EastEnders and 7.4 in Hollyoaks. The researchers also found that Emmerdale was the only soap where alcohol consumption was more common in the evening than during the day. Lead researcher Dr. Sarah Jarvis said the findings were concerning, as they suggested that Emmerdale was ""normalising"" alcohol consumption. ""Alcohol is often portrayed as a way to relax, celebrate or cope with stress,"" she said. ""This can lead people to believe that drinking alcohol is a normal and harmless part of everyday life."" Dr. Jarvis said that the study's findings were particularly concerning given that Emmerdale is watched by a large number of young people. ""Young people are more likely to be influenced by what they see on television,"" she said. ""If they see alcohol being consumed frequently on Emmerdale, they may be more likely to think that it is acceptable to drink alcohol themselves."" Dr. Jarvis said that it was important for soap operas to be responsible in their portrayal of alcohol consumption. ""Soaps have a powerful influence on viewers,"" she said. ""They can use this influence to promote positive messages about alcohol consumption, such as the importance of drinking in moderation and avoiding binge drinking."" An ITV spokesperson said that Emmerdale ""reflects real life"" and that ""alcohol consumption is a part of many people's lives"". ""We always aim to portray alcohol consumption in a responsible way,"" the spokesperson said. ""We work closely with alcohol awareness charities to ensure that our storylines are accurate and do not glamorize alcohol misuse.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Harry Richford inquest: 'Lives at risk' over locum doctor recruitment,"Harry Richford inquest: 'Lives at risk' over locum doctor recruitment The recruitment of locum doctors is putting lives at risk, an inquest has heard. Harry Richford, 26, died after he was given the wrong dose of medication by a locum doctor at Stafford Hospital in 2018. The inquest into his death heard that the doctor, who was working through an agency, had not been properly checked by the hospital. The doctor had a history of making errors and had been dismissed from another hospital, but this information was not passed on to Stafford Hospital. The inquest heard that the doctor had been working at Stafford Hospital for three months before Richford's death. During that time, he had made a number of mistakes, including prescribing the wrong medication to another patient. The inquest also heard that the doctor had been drinking alcohol before he started his shift on the day Richford died. The doctor has since been struck off the medical register. The inquest concluded that Richford's death was avoidable and that the hospital had failed to take reasonable steps to protect patients. The coroner said that the hospital's recruitment process for locum doctors was ""inadequate"" and that ""lives are at risk"" if it does not improve. The inquest made a number of recommendations to the hospital, including: Improving the recruitment process for locum doctors Ensuring that locum doctors are properly checked before they start work Providing more training for staff on how to deal with locum doctors Developing a system for monitoring the performance of locum doctors The hospital said that it had accepted the recommendations and that it was ""committed to improving the safety of patients."" However, the inquest heard that the hospital had not taken any action to improve the recruitment process for locum doctors since Richford's death. The inquest also heard that the hospital had not provided any additional training for staff on how to deal with locum doctors. The coroner said that he was ""disappointed"" that the hospital had not taken any action to improve the recruitment process for locum doctors. He said that the hospital had a ""duty of care"" to patients and that it must do everything it can to protect them.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Poland must suspend judge discipline panel – ECJ,"Poland must suspend judge discipline panel – ECJ The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ordered Poland to immediately suspend the operation of its Disciplinary Chamber for judges, ruling that the body undermines judicial independence. The decision comes in response to a request from the European Commission, which had argued that the Disciplinary Chamber violated EU law by allowing for the arbitrary dismissal of judges who criticize the government. The ECJ found that the Disciplinary Chamber is not independent or impartial, and that its procedures do not provide sufficient guarantees of fairness. It also noted that the chamber had been used to target judges who had ruled against the government, or who had expressed critical views of the judicial reforms. The ECJ's ruling is a major blow to the Polish government, which has been criticized for its efforts to bring the judiciary under its control. The ruling could also have implications for other EU countries that are considering implementing similar measures. In a statement, the European Commission welcomed the ECJ's decision, saying that it was a ""clear victory for judicial independence in Poland and for the rule of law in the EU."" The Commission also called on Poland to fully implement the ruling. The Polish government has not yet commented on the ECJ's decision. However, it is expected to appeal the ruling to the ECJ's highest court, the Court of Justice. The ECJ's ruling is the latest development in a long-running conflict between the EU and Poland over the rule of law. The EU has expressed concerns about a number of reforms implemented by the Polish government, including a law that lowers the retirement age for judges and a law that gives the government greater control over the appointment of judges. The Polish government has defended its reforms, arguing that they are necessary to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the judiciary.

Litvinenko inquiry: Ex-spy 'investigating Stolichnaya vodka row',"Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko's widow is investigating the row over Stolichnaya vodka after a judge ruled it is ""made in Russia"" despite the firm's claims it is now made in Latvia. Marina Litvinenko says she is ""very interested"" in the legal battle over the popular brand, which claims to have moved production to Latvia to distance itself from the ""toxic"" reputation of Russian goods. Her late husband was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 by two Russian agents in London, allegedly on the orders of President Vladimir Putin. The dispute over Stolichnaya's origins has raised concerns that consumers are being misled and may even be funding the Russian regime, which is facing international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Stolichnaya is one of the world's best-selling vodka brands, with annual sales of around $1 billion. It is owned by Russian businessman Yuri Shefler, who fled Russia in 2000 after falling out with the Kremlin. In 2013, Stolichnaya announced it was moving production to Latvia, a member of the European Union, to distance itself from the ""toxic"" reputation of Russian goods. However, a recent court ruling in the United States found that Stolichnaya is still ""made in Russia"" because the spirits used to make the vodka are distilled and filtered in Russia. The ruling has sparked anger among consumers and retailers, who say they have been misled. Some stores have even stopped selling Stolichnaya. Marina Litvinenko said she is ""very interested"" in the legal battle over Stolichnaya. She said: ""I am concerned that consumers are being misled and that the Russian regime may be benefiting from the sale of this vodka."" She added: ""I am considering taking legal action against Stolichnaya to ensure that consumers are not misled and that the Russian regime does not benefit from the sale of this vodka."" Stolichnaya has denied any wrongdoing and said it is ""confident"" it will win the legal battle. The company said in a statement: ""Stolichnaya is made in Latvia, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. We are confident that the court will ultimately uphold our position."" The dispute over Stolichnaya is the latest in a series of legal battles over the origins of Russian goods. In 2021, a US court ruled that Russian Standard vodka is not ""made in Russia"" because it is distilled in Russia but bottled in Latvia. The ruling has led to calls for stricter labeling laws to ensure that consumers are not misled about the origins of products.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Guildford Four man Gerry Conlon's 'living hell' revealed,"Gerry Conlon's 'Living Hell' Revealed Gerry Conlon, a member of the Guildford Four, has spoken out about the ""living hell"" he endured during his wrongful imprisonment for the IRA pub bombings in 1974. Conlon was only 17 when he was arrested and falsely accused of planting the bombs that killed five people and injured 65 in Guildford, Surrey. He was sentenced to life imprisonment along with three other innocent men - Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong, and Carole Richardson. In a new interview with the BBC, Conlon described the horrific conditions he faced in prison. He was subjected to beatings, solitary confinement, and psychological torture. ""I was living in a constant state of fear,"" he said. ""I didn't know if I was going to be killed or tortured at any moment."" In one particularly harrowing incident, Conlon was taken to a room and told he was going to be executed. ""They put a black hood over my head and led me to a room,"" he said. ""I heard a click and I thought, 'This is it, I'm going to die'."" As he prepared to be shot, a voice suddenly shouted, ""Stop!"" Conlon had narrowly escaped death. Despite the constant trauma, Conlon managed to maintain his innocence throughout his 15 years behind bars. He was finally released in 1989 when the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions. In the years since his release, Conlon has dedicated his life to campaigning for justice for other victims of miscarriages of justice. He has also written a book about his experiences, called ""Proved Innocent"". Conlon's story is a powerful reminder of the devastating consequences of wrongful imprisonment. His experience highlights the urgent need for reforms to the criminal justice system to prevent such injustices from happening again. In addition to the physical and psychological torture, Conlon also endured social isolation during his imprisonment. He was cut off from his family and friends, and had no contact with the outside world for long periods of time. This isolation further exacerbated the trauma he experienced. Despite the challenges he faced, Conlon remained resilient throughout his ordeal. He found solace in reading, writing poetry, and playing guitar. He also drew strength from the support of his fellow prisoners, who knew he was innocent. Conlon's story is not just a personal tragedy. It is also a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of fighting for justice, even in the darkest of times.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
High-rise flats approved for Bedminster shopping centre,"High-rise flats approved for Bedminster shopping centre Developers have been given the go-ahead to build two tower blocks of flats on the site of a former shopping centre in Bedminster. The plans for the former Victoria Park site include 247 build-to-rent apartments, of which 124 will be affordable homes. Bristol City Council's development control committee (DCC) approved the application on Tuesday (28 June). The towers will be 19 and 20 storeys high, and will be built on the site of the former Victoria Park shopping centre, which closed in 2016. The new development will also include commercial space on the ground floor, as well as a public square and a new pedestrian route through the site. The application was approved despite concerns from some local residents about the height of the buildings and the impact they would have on the character of the area. However, planning officers said the benefits of the scheme outweighed the concerns, and that the towers would be a ""landmark"" development for Bedminster. The developers, Legal & General, said they were ""delighted"" with the decision. ""This is a major milestone for this exciting development, which will transform a brownfield site into a thriving new neighbourhood,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are committed to creating a high-quality development that will be a positive addition to the local community."" The development is expected to be completed by 2025.

ASA probes Home Office 'go home' van campaign,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has launched an investigation into the Home Office's ""Go Home"" van campaign after receiving complaints that it is offensive and discriminatory. The campaign, which was launched in August, features vans driving around London and other cities with the message ""Go Home"" emblazoned on the side. The vans also display the website address of the Home Office's ""Go Home"" campaign, which provides information on how to report illegal immigrants. The ASA has received over 100 complaints about the campaign, with many people arguing that it is offensive and discriminatory. Some complainants have also argued that the campaign is ineffective and will not deter illegal immigration. The Home Office has defended the campaign, arguing that it is a necessary measure to deter illegal immigration. The Home Office has also said that the campaign is not intended to be offensive or discriminatory, and that it is targeted at illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants. The ASA is now investigating the complaints and will decide whether the campaign breaches the Advertising Codes. If the ASA finds that the campaign does breach the Advertising Codes, it could order the Home Office to withdraw or amend the campaign. The ""Go Home"" campaign has been widely criticized by politicians, community groups, and human rights organizations. Critics have argued that the campaign is divisive and will create a hostile environment for immigrants. Some critics have also argued that the campaign is racist and Islamophobic. The campaign has also been criticized by some within the Home Office. In September, a group of senior Home Office officials wrote a letter to the Home Secretary, Theresa May, expressing their concerns about the campaign. The officials argued that the campaign was ""divisive and counterproductive,"" and that it would ""damage community relations."" The ""Go Home"" campaign is part of the government's wider crackdown on immigration. In recent years, the government has introduced a number of measures to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to live in the UK. These measures include making it harder for illegal immigrants to access healthcare, education, and employment. The government has also increased the number of deportations of illegal immigrants. In 2014, the government deported over 28,000 illegal immigrants, the highest number in a decade.

Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain,"Aberdeen: Britain's Best-Placed City for Growth Aberdeen has emerged as the best-placed city for growth in Britain, according to a new study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR). The study assessed factors such as economic performance, infrastructure, skills, and innovation, and found that Aberdeen ranked highly in all key areas. Robust Economic Performance Aberdeen's economy has weathered the recent economic downturn relatively well, with the city's unemployment rate remaining below the national average. The city's strong performance is largely due to its diverse economic base, which includes a mix of traditional industries such as oil and gas, as well as emerging sectors such as renewable energy and technology. Excellent Infrastructure Aberdeen has excellent infrastructure, with a well-developed transport network and a reliable energy supply. The city is also home to a number of world-class universities and research institutions, which provide a steady stream of skilled workers and innovation. Highly Skilled Workforce Aberdeen has a highly skilled workforce, with a large proportion of its population holding higher education qualifications. The city's universities and colleges provide a pipeline of talent for local businesses, while the influx of skilled workers from other parts of the UK and abroad has further boosted the local labor market. Strong Innovation Culture Aberdeen has a strong innovation culture, with a number of research and development centers located in the city. The city is also home to a number of tech start-ups and incubators, which provide support for new and emerging businesses. This innovation ecosystem has helped to create a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment in Aberdeen. Government Support Aberdeen has benefited from significant government support in recent years, with the city receiving funding for a number of infrastructure projects and regeneration schemes. This investment has helped to create jobs and improve the quality of life for local residents, making Aberdeen an even more attractive place to live and work. Outlook for the Future The outlook for Aberdeen's growth prospects is positive. The city's economy is expected to continue to grow, driven by the recovery in the oil and gas sector and the development of new industries. Aberdeen's strong infrastructure, highly skilled workforce, and innovation culture will also continue to be major drivers of growth. As a result of these factors, Aberdeen is well-positioned to be a major hub for economic activity in Britain in the years to come.

Scotland's gone 'too far' on universal benefits says poverty advisor,"Scotland's welfare system has gone ""too far"" in providing universal benefits, according to a leading poverty adviser. John Dickie, the chairman of the Bevan Foundation, said the country was ""setting a dangerous precedent"" by giving benefits to all children, regardless of their family's income. He argued that universal benefits are ""not the best way"" to tackle child poverty and could lead to a ""dependency culture"". Mr Dickie's comments come as the Scottish government prepares to introduce a new system of universal benefits, which will see all children under the age of 16 receive a weekly payment of £20. The policy has been welcomed by some anti-poverty campaigners, who argue that it will help to reduce child poverty in Scotland. However, Mr Dickie said that universal benefits are ""not the answer"" to child poverty and could have a number of negative consequences. He said: ""Universal benefits are not the best way to tackle child poverty. They are expensive, they can create a dependency culture, and they can lead to people feeling stigmatized."" Mr Dickie argued that the Scottish government should instead focus on providing targeted support to families who are most in need. He said: ""We need to be focusing on helping families who are struggling to make ends meet. That means providing targeted support to those who need it most."" The Scottish government has defended its plans for universal benefits, arguing that they will help to reduce child poverty and create a fairer society. However, Mr Dickie's comments have reignited the debate about the best way to tackle child poverty in Scotland. It is a complex issue with no easy answers. The Scottish government is right to be ambitious in its efforts to reduce child poverty, but it is important to ensure that any new policies are effective and do not have unintended negative consequences.

The report also shows that the number of children living in severe poverty has fallen by 5,000 since 2019. Severe poverty is defined as living in a household with an income below 50% of the median income. The Welsh government said the fall in child poverty was due to a number of factors, including: An increase in the incomes of low-income families A decrease in the number of children living in workless households A decrease in the number of children living in overcrowded households The report also shows that the gap between the incomes of the richest and poorest families in Wales has narrowed since 2019.

Glasgow's Burrell Collection becomes listed building,"Glasgow's Burrell Collection, one of the city's most treasured museums, has been listed as a Category A building by Historic Environment Scotland (HES). The move recognises the outstanding architectural and historical significance of the building, which houses a world-renowned collection of art and artefacts. The Burrell Collection was founded in 1944 when Sir William Burrell, a wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, gifted his vast collection of over 9,000 objects to the city of Glasgow. The collection includes paintings, sculptures, furniture, ceramics, and other objects from all over the world. The museum building was designed by Sir Basil Spence and completed in 1983. The building is a striking example of mid-century modern architecture, with its distinctive curved roof and glass facade. The building is set in Pollok Country Park, on the outskirts of Glasgow, and offers stunning views of the city and the surrounding countryside. The listing of the Burrell Collection as a Category A building will help to protect the building and ensure its long-term preservation. The building is already a popular tourist destination and the listing is likely to increase its appeal to visitors from around the world.

Fly-tipping prosecutions fall by two-thirds in Scotland,"Fly-tipping prosecutions in Scotland have plummeted by two-thirds in the last decade, figures obtained by the BBC show. In 2013, there were 889 prosecutions for illegally dumping waste, but by 2022, that number had fallen to just 298. Environmental groups have warned that the decline is a ""major concern"" and could lead to an increase in fly-tipping. The Scottish government said it was ""disappointed"" by the figures and was ""taking action"" to tackle the problem. Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of waste, often on land or in water. It can include anything from household rubbish to construction waste. It is a serious environmental crime and can have a devastating impact on wildlife, habitats, and human health. The BBC obtained the figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). They show that the number of fly-tipping prosecutions has fallen steadily in Scotland since 2013. In 2013, there were 889 prosecutions, but by 2014, that number had fallen to 783. In 2015, it fell again to 675, and in 2016, it fell to 567. The decline has continued in recent years, with 445 prosecutions in 2017, 373 in 2018, 321 in 2019, and 298 in 2022. Environmental groups have warned that the decline in prosecutions is a ""major concern"" and could lead to an increase in fly-tipping. ""Fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime that can have a devastating impact on our wildlife, habitats, and human health,"" said Ruth Chambers, the head of policy and advocacy at Keep Scotland Beautiful. ""The decline in prosecutions for this crime is a major concern and could lead to an increase in fly-tipping. ""The government needs to take action to tackle this problem, including increasing the number of prosecutions for fly-tipping and imposing stricter penalties on those who are caught."" The Scottish government said it was ""disappointed"" by the figures and was ""taking action"" to tackle the problem. ""We are disappointed by these figures, which show that the number of fly-tipping prosecutions has fallen in recent years,"" said a Scottish government spokesperson. ""We are committed to tackling this problem and are taking action to do so, including increasing the number of SEPA officers who can investigate and prosecute fly-tipping. ""We are also working with local authorities and other partners to raise awareness of the issue and to encourage people to dispose of their waste responsibly.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Healthy breakfasts 'help pupils do well',"Healthy Breakfasts Help Pupils Do Well Research has consistently shown that eating a healthy breakfast can have a positive impact on a child's academic performance. In this article, we explore how a nutritious breakfast can help pupils do well in school. Improved Concentration and Memory Breakfast provides the brain with essential nutrients, such as glucose, which is the primary source of energy for the brain. Without a sufficient intake of glucose, pupils may experience difficulty concentrating and paying attention in class. Studies have shown that children who eat breakfast have improved short-term memory and problem-solving abilities. Enhanced Cognitive Function A healthy breakfast also contains essential micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which are crucial for brain health. Iron, for example, is essential for the production of red blood cells, which transport oxygen throughout the body, including to the brain. Vitamin B12 is another important nutrient for cognitive function, as it is involved in the production of neurotransmitters. Improved Attendance and Punctuality Pupils who eat a healthy breakfast are less likely to miss school or arrive late. When children are well-nourished, they are less likely to experience physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches, that can prevent them from attending school. In addition, eating a nutritious breakfast can help pupils stay energized throughout the morning, improving their overall alertness and reducing the likelihood of tardiness. Increased Academic Achievement Several studies have shown a positive correlation between eating a healthy breakfast and academic achievement. In one study, children who ate a healthy breakfast were found to have higher scores on standardized tests in math and reading. Another study found that pupils who ate a healthy breakfast were more likely to be in the top quartile of their class in math and English. Practical Tips for Parents To ensure that pupils get a healthy breakfast, parents can consider the following tips: Offer a variety of nutritious options, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Encourage children to eat breakfast at a regular time each day. Avoid sugary cereals and drinks, as these provide a quick but unsustainable energy boost. If children are reluctant to eat breakfast at home, consider packing a healthy snack to eat later at school. In conclusion, a healthy breakfast is essential for pupils to reach their full academic potential. By providing their children with a nutritious start to the day, parents can help improve their concentration, memory, cognitive function, attendance, punctuality, and overall academic achievement.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Parades Commission not going anywhere,"The Parades Commission, the body responsible for managing parades and protests in Northern Ireland, will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. This is despite calls from some quarters for its abolition, following a number of controversial decisions in recent years. The Commission was established in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement. Its purpose is to ensure that parades are held in a safe and orderly manner, and to minimize the potential for public disorder. The Commission has the power to ban parades, or to impose conditions on their route or timing. In recent years, the Commission has been criticized for its decisions on a number of high-profile parades. In 2013, for example, it banned an Orange Order parade from passing through a Catholic area of Belfast. This decision sparked widespread anger and led to rioting in the city. Despite these controversies, the Commission has continued to operate, and it is likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future. There is no political consensus on how to reform the Commission, and any attempt to abolish it would likely be met with strong opposition from both sides of the community. The Commission's continued existence is a reminder of the ongoing need for dialogue and cooperation in Northern Ireland. The parades issue is a complex and sensitive one, and there is no easy solution. However, the Commission provides a mechanism for managing this issue in a way that minimizes the potential for violence and instability. The Commission's work is not without its challenges. It must balance the right to freedom of assembly with the need to protect public safety. It must also navigate the often-difficult terrain of inter-communal relations in Northern Ireland. However, the Commission has shown itself to be a resilient and effective body, and it is likely to continue to play a vital role in the years to come. The Commission's continued operation is a sign of the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement. However, it is also a reminder of the challenges that remain. The parades issue is a complex and sensitive one, and there is no easy solution.

Kanye West finally answers Jimmy Kimmel's Donald Trump question,"Kanye West Breaks Silence on Trump with Kimmel In a highly anticipated interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Kanye West finally addressed his controversial support for former President Donald Trump. The interview, which aired on Tuesday, marked the first time West had publicly commented on his political views since the 2020 election. Kimmel wasted no time in confronting West, asking him directly why he had supported Trump despite the former president's divisive rhetoric. West initially dodged the question, but after Kimmel pressed him, he eventually admitted that he had been ""impressed"" by Trump's ""business acumen"" and ""leadership.""

But he stood up for what he believed in."" Kimmel also questioned West about his own political ambitions. West confirmed that he was considering running for president in 2024, but he declined to provide any details about his campaign. ""I'm still exploring it,"" West said. ""I'm not going to make any decisions until after the midterm elections."" The interview was met with mixed reactions.

Concert marks 40 years since the Rolling Stones 'nearly' rocked Pembroke,"In the quaint coastal town of Pembroke, the echoes of a legendary concert that almost took place 40 years ago reverberated through the streets, igniting a nostalgic flame among music enthusiasts. The year was 1982, and the world-renowned Rolling Stones were at the height of their fame. Rumors had swirled that the band was considering adding Pembroke to their European tour itinerary, sending the town into a frenzy of excitement. Local organizers worked tirelessly to secure the venue, the Pembroke Town Hall, and eagerly awaited confirmation from the Stones' management. However, fate had other plans. Just days before the scheduled concert, the tour was abruptly canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. The disappointment was palpable, but the memory of the near-miss concert lived on. To commemorate the 40th anniversary of this almost-event, a special tribute concert was organized at the very venue where the Stones had planned to perform. The 'Stones Nearly Rocked Pembroke' concert featured local bands and musicians paying homage to the legendary band. The evening was a celebration of the enduring legacy of the Rolling Stones and a testament to the enduring spirit of Pembroke. Among the performers was Jake Thomas, a local guitarist who had been a teenager when the Stones were rumored to be coming to town. ""It's surreal to think that one of the greatest bands in the world almost played on this stage,"" he said. ""Tonight, we're keeping their spirit alive."" As the music filled the air, attendees couldn't help but imagine what it would have been like to witness the Rolling Stones in such an intimate setting. The atmosphere was electric, charged with a sense of both nostalgia and anticipation. The concert closed with a rousing rendition of ""Satisfaction,"" the Stones' timeless anthem. The crowd erupted in thunderous applause, paying tribute to the band that nearly rocked Pembroke but forever left an imprint on the town's musical history. While the Rolling Stones may not have graced the Pembroke Town Hall stage in 1982, the 'Stones Nearly Rocked Pembroke' concert served as a fitting reminder of the power of music to inspire and connect generations.

"University merger 'conspiracy', says Dr Peter Noyes","University Merger 'Conspiracy', Says Dr Peter Noyes Dr Peter Noyes, a former vice-chancellor of the University of Greenwich, has accused the government of ""orchestrating a conspiracy"" to merge universities. In a blog post, Dr Noyes claims that the government is ""bullying"" universities into merging in order to create a ""handful of mega-universities"". He says that this is being done despite the fact that there is no evidence that larger universities are better than smaller ones. ""The government's claim that mergers will improve the quality of higher education is simply not supported by the evidence,"" Dr Noyes writes. He argues that smaller universities are often more innovative and responsive to the needs of students and businesses. ""They are also more likely to be embedded in their local communities and to contribute to the local economy,"" he says. Dr Noyes's claims come as the government is consulting on plans to merge the University of Greenwich with the University of Kent. The government says that the merger will create a ""world-leading university"" that will be ""better able to compete internationally"". However, Dr Noyes argues that the merger will actually damage both universities. ""The University of Greenwich has a strong track record of innovation and success,"" he says. ""The merger will only serve to stifle this innovation and creativity."" Dr Noyes is not the only person to express concerns about the government's merger plans. The National Union of Students (NUS) has also criticized the plans, saying that they will ""damage the quality of higher education in the UK"". The NUS says that the government's plans are ""driven by ideology, not by evidence"". ""The government is simply trying to create a handful of mega-universities that will be easier to control,"" the NUS says.

CBI says leaving EU would have serious consequences for Britain,"The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has warned of ""significant consequences"" for the country's criminal justice and anti-corruption systems if it leaves the European Union without a deal. In a letter to the Home Office, the SFO said that its cross-border operations would be ""severely disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as it would lose access to key EU tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the EU Directive on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAT). The SFO also expressed concern about the potential impact of Brexit on its ability to recover stolen assets from overseas, as well as its cooperation with European partners on transnational crime investigations. The SFO's warning comes as Parliament prepares to vote on the government's proposed Brexit deal. If the deal is rejected, the UK will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March 2019. The SFO is not the only law enforcement agency to express concerns about the impact of Brexit. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has also warned of ""significant risks"" to the UK's national security if it leaves the EU without a deal. The NCA said that Brexit would make it more difficult to track and prosecute organized crime gangs, as well as share intelligence with European partners. The EU has also warned of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The European Commission has said that the UK would lose access to a number of EU law enforcement and judicial cooperation mechanisms, including the EAW and MLAT. The Commission has also said that the UK would no longer be party to a number of international agreements on law enforcement and judicial cooperation, such as the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights. The UK government has said that it is committed to maintaining its high levels of law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the EU after Brexit. However, it is unclear how the UK will be able to maintain these levels of cooperation if it leaves the EU without a deal. The SFO's warning is a reminder of the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The UK government must take urgent action to address the concerns of law enforcement agencies and ensure that the country's criminal justice and anti-corruption systems are not weakened after Brexit. A no-deal Brexit would also have a significant impact on the UK's economy. The SFO estimated that the UK economy would lose up to £100 billion over the next 10 years if it leaves the EU without a deal. The SFO also warned that Brexit would make it more difficult for UK businesses to trade with the EU, as they would face new tariffs and regulations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Honduras protests: Buildings burn during clashes over reforms,"Amidst a deepening social and political crisis, Honduras has erupted in widespread protests over proposed constitutional reforms. The demonstrations, marked by violence and destruction, have cast a shadow over the country's fragile democracy. Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tegucigalpa, the capital, and other cities on Sunday, expressing their anger against the government's plan to establish new electoral courts. They fear that the reforms, if implemented, would undermine the integrity of future elections and consolidate the power of the ruling National Party. As the protests intensified, clashes erupted between demonstrators and security forces. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails, setting fire to government buildings, including the headquarters of the National Electoral Institute (TSE). Police responded with tear gas, water cannons, and live ammunition, leaving several people injured. Amidst the chaos, President Juan Orlando Hernández declared a state of emergency, suspending constitutional guarantees for 10 days. This move has been widely criticized as an attempt to stifle dissent and suppress the legitimate grievances of the Honduran people. The protests have exposed deep-rooted divisions within Honduran society. Many citizens are disillusioned with the government, accusing it of corruption, authoritarianism, and economic mismanagement. They demand free and fair elections, the rule of law, and the end of what they see as a corrupt and repressive regime. However, the government maintains that the constitutional reforms are necessary to improve the electoral system and strengthen democracy. It accuses the opposition of inciting violence and seeking to destabilize the country. The international community has expressed concern over the situation in Honduras. The United States, a close ally, has urged the government to respect the right to peaceful protest and to engage in dialogue with the opposition. The Organization of American States (OAS) has also called for calm and restraint. The protests have highlighted the challenges facing Honduras. The country has been plagued by poverty, inequality, and violence for decades. The current crisis has deepened these problems, leaving the future of the nation in doubt. It remains unclear how the situation will unfold. The government has vowed to restore order, while protesters remain determined to fight for their demands. The outcome of this confrontation will have a profound impact on the future of Honduran democracy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Duterte pulls police off controversial drugs crackdown,"Duterte pulls police off controversial drugs crackdown Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered police to stand down from his controversial anti-drugs campaign, which has been criticized for widespread human rights abuses. The move comes after a report by the Philippine National Police (PNP) revealed that more than 6,600 people had been killed in police anti-drug operations since Duterte took office in 2016. The report also found that many of the killings were extrajudicial, meaning they were carried out without due process of law. Duterte has defended the crackdown, saying it is necessary to rid the country of the drug menace. However, the United Nations and other human rights groups have condemned the killings, saying they amount to a ""war on the poor."" In a televised address on Thursday, Duterte said he was withdrawing the police from the anti-drugs campaign because he did not want them to be ""scapegoats"" for the killings. He said the campaign would now be led by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). ""I am giving them the last chance to prove themselves,"" Duterte said of the police. ""If they continue to abuse their authority, I will not hesitate to fire all of them."" The PNP welcomed Duterte's decision, saying it would allow them to focus on their other duties. The PDEA, however, has said it is not ready to take over the anti-drugs campaign. It is unclear what impact Duterte's decision will have on the drug problem in the Philippines. Some experts believe that the crackdown has actually made the problem worse, by driving drug users deeper into the shadows. Others believe that the crackdown has been effective in reducing crime and drug use. Only time will tell whether Duterte's decision to withdraw the police from the anti-drugs campaign will have a positive or negative impact on the Philippines.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
The Men Who Own Scotland: Land reform on 'radical journey',"In the heart of the Scottish Highlands, amidst rolling hills and shimmering lochs, lies a vast and contested landscape. It is a land owned by a privileged few, a legacy of centuries-old feudalism that has left deep scars on the social fabric of Scotland. But now, a wave of land reform is sweeping across the country, promising to redistribute power and give communities a greater say in how their land is used. At the forefront of this movement are organizations like Community Land Scotland (CLS), which supports community buyouts of land from private landowners. Since its inception in 2003, CLS has helped over 200 communities across Scotland acquire ownership of their land, totaling over 600,000 acres. One of the most successful community buyouts was the Knoydart Peninsula, a remote and rugged area in the northwest Highlands. In 1999, the community raised over £2 million to purchase the peninsula from a private estate. Since then, they have transformed the area, creating a thriving community-owned enterprise that includes sustainable forestry, tourism, and crofting. The land reform movement is not without its challenges. Landowners have resisted community buyouts, arguing that they will lead to a loss of investment and economic decline. However, supporters of land reform argue that community ownership can actually boost local economies by empowering communities to create jobs and develop sustainable businesses. The Scottish government has been supportive of land reform, passing legislation in 2015 that gives communities a ""right to buy"" abandoned or neglected land. This has led to a surge in community buyouts, as communities seize the opportunity to take control of their land. One of the most recent examples of this is the buyout of the Isle of Gigha, a small island off the west coast of Scotland. In 2022, the community raised £4.5 million to purchase the island from its private owner. They plan to use the land to develop sustainable agriculture, tourism, and renewable energy projects. The land reform movement in Scotland is still in its early stages, but it has already made a significant impact. It is a radical journey that is challenging centuries-old power structures and giving communities a greater say in their future. As the movement continues to grow, it has the potential to transform the landscape of Scotland, both physically and politically.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Motorway lessons proposed for learner drivers,"Motorway Lessons Proposed for Learner Drivers In a bid to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents involving novice drivers, the government has proposed introducing mandatory motorway lessons for learner drivers. The lessons would be an addition to the current driving test and would focus on teaching drivers how to safely navigate motorways. According to the Department for Transport, around 20% of all road deaths involve drivers who have held a driving license for less than two years. Motorways are particularly hazardous for inexperienced drivers, as they are often unfamiliar with the high speeds and complex traffic patterns. The proposed motorway lessons would be delivered by qualified driving instructors and would cover a range of topics, including: Motorway lane discipline Safe overtaking and merging Emergency procedures Using motorway signs and signals Safe speed management The lessons would be designed to give learner drivers the confidence and skills they need to drive safely on motorways. They would also help to reduce the number of accidents caused by inexperienced drivers. The government's proposal has been welcomed by road safety campaigners. The RAC Foundation said that the lessons would be a ""positive step"" towards improving road safety. However, some driving instructors have expressed concerns about the cost of the lessons and the potential impact on learner drivers' confidence. The cost of the motorway lessons has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be in the region of £50-£100. The lessons would be optional, but learner drivers would be strongly encouraged to take them. The government is considering a number of options for delivering the motorway lessons. One option is to make them a compulsory part of the driving test. Another option is to offer the lessons as an additional service by driving instructors. The government is also considering whether to extend the motorway lessons to all new drivers, regardless of their age or experience. This would help to ensure that all drivers have the skills and knowledge they need to drive safely on motorways. The government's consultation on the proposed motorway lessons is now open. The consultation will close on 28th February 2023. The government will then consider the feedback received and make a decision on whether to implement the lessons.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Dalian Atkinson: Ex-footballer 'staggered' towards accused PC,"Dalian Atkinson's widow has told a court she saw her husband ""staggering"" towards a police officer moments before he was Tasered and kicked in the head. Elaine Atkinson said the former Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday striker was ""incoherent"" and ""not making sense"" at the time. PC Benjamin Monk, 43, denies murder and manslaughter. The jury at Birmingham Crown Court was shown body-worn camera footage of the incident in Telford, Shropshire, in August 2016. Monk and another officer, PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, were called after Atkinson was reported to have been banging on the door of his father's home. The court heard that Atkinson had mental health problems and had been drinking heavily. His widow said she arrived at the house shortly after the police and saw her husband staggering towards PC Monk. ""He seemed very unsteady on his feet,"" she said. ""He was stumbling and incoherent. I didn't know what to think. I was worried about his safety."" She said she thought her husband was asking for help and called out to him to go back to the house. ""He didn't respond,"" she said. ""He was too far away by then."" The court was shown footage from PC Monk's body-worn camera which showed Atkinson stumbling towards him. PC Monk drew his Taser and ordered Atkinson to stop, but he continued to approach. Monk then fired the Taser and Atkinson fell to the ground. As Atkinson lay on the ground, Monk kicked him three times in the head. Atkinson died in hospital the following day. Monk has admitted kicking Atkinson, but said he did so in self-defence because he believed Atkinson was trying to grab his Taser. The trial continues.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New marine zone plans scrapped by minister,"New marine zone plans scrapped by minister Environment Minister Rebecca Pow has scrapped plans to create a network of marine conservation zones in English waters, a move that has been met with anger from environmental groups. The plans, which were first proposed in 2018, would have seen 127 areas of the sea designated as marine conservation zones (MCZs). These areas would have been protected from damaging activities such as fishing, dredging and seabed mining. However, Pow has now announced that the government will not be proceeding with the plans. She said that the decision was made after a ""careful review"" of the evidence, and that the government believes that the existing network of marine protected areas is sufficient to protect the marine environment. Environmental groups have condemned the decision, arguing that it will damage marine life and habitats. They say that the proposed MCZs would have protected important areas for wildlife, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. ""This is a devastating blow for our seas,"" said Richard Benyon, chairman of the Marine Conservation Society. ""The government has failed to stand up for our marine environment and has put our seas at risk."" The Wildlife Trusts also criticized the decision, saying that it was a ""betrayal"" of the government's promise to protect the environment. ""The government has ignored the overwhelming scientific evidence that shows that marine conservation zones are essential for protecting our seas,"" said Rob Cunningham, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts. The decision to scrap the marine zone plans comes at a time when the government is facing growing pressure to protect the environment. The government has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and has set out a number of policies to reduce pollution and protect wildlife. However, environmental groups say that the government's actions do not match its rhetoric. They say that the decision to scrap the marine zone plans shows that the government is not serious about protecting the environment. The government has defended its decision, saying that it is committed to protecting the marine environment.

Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush,"Pawnbrokers have warned that a government probe into the industry could lead to a rise in illegal lending by loan sharks. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the sector, amid concerns over high interest rates and hidden charges. But pawnbrokers say the probe could deter legitimate businesses from operating, leaving a vacuum that could be filled by unregulated lenders. ""If the CMA makes it too difficult for pawnbrokers to operate, then loan sharks will step in to fill the void,"" said Michael Anscombe, chief executive of the National Pawnbrokers Association. ""Loan sharks charge extortionate rates of interest and use intimidation and violence to collect debts. This is a real danger to vulnerable people."" The CMA is investigating whether pawnbrokers are breaking competition law by charging excessive interest rates and failing to provide customers with clear information about the terms of their loans. The investigation was launched after the CMA received a number of complaints from consumers about the industry. Some consumers have complained that they have been charged interest rates of up to 1,500% APR on pawn loans. Others have said that they have been misled about the terms of their loans, and have ended up losing their valuables. The CMA has said that it is too early to say what the outcome of the investigation will be. But it has warned that it could take action against pawnbrokers who are found to be breaking the law. ""We are concerned about the potential impact of the CMA investigation on the pawnbroking industry,"" said Anscombe. ""We believe that pawnbrokers provide a valuable service to many people, particularly those who are on low incomes or who have poor credit histories. We urge the CMA to take into account the impact of its investigation on the whole industry, and not just on a few bad apples."" The pawnbroking industry is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA has a number of rules in place to protect consumers, including a cap on interest rates and a requirement for pawnbrokers to provide customers with clear information about the terms of their loans. However, the FCA has been criticized for not doing enough to protect consumers from loan sharks. In 2016, the FCA was fined £10.5 million for failing to properly supervise the payday lending industry. The CMA investigation is likely to take several months to complete. It is unclear what the outcome of the investigation will be, but it is possible that the CMA could take action against pawnbrokers who are found to be breaking the law.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Vauxhall: Crunch talks to save Ellesmere Port plant continue,"Vauxhall: Crunch talks to save Ellesmere Port plant continue Discussions are continuing between Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis and the UK government in a bid to save the carmaker's Ellesmere Port plant. The future of the factory, which employs around 1,000 people, has been in doubt since Vauxhall announced in July that it would be closing the site in 2022. The government has since offered a £30m grant to help secure the plant's future, but Stellantis has said that it needs more financial support in order to make the investment necessary to convert the factory to electric vehicle production. Talks between the two sides have been ongoing for several weeks, but no agreement has yet been reached. A source close to the negotiations told the BBC that the talks were ""very difficult"" and that there was no guarantee that a deal would be reached. ""Stellantis is asking for a lot of money, and the government is reluctant to give it to them,"" the source said. ""There is a real risk that the plant will close if a deal cannot be reached."" The Ellesmere Port plant is one of the UK's largest car factories, and its closure would be a major blow to the local economy. The plant has been producing cars since the 1960s, and it has played a key role in the development of the UK's automotive industry. The closure of the plant would also be a major blow to the UK's efforts to become a leader in the production of electric vehicles. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and it is hoping to encourage the development of a thriving electric vehicle industry in the UK. The Ellesmere Port plant is well-suited to the production of electric vehicles, and its closure would be a major setback to the government's plans. The talks between Stellantis and the government are expected to continue in the coming days. It is hoped that a deal can be reached that will save the Ellesmere Port plant and secure its future as a major center for the production of electric vehicles.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Chinese investment in the US falls sharply in 2017,"Chinese investment in the US plummeted by 35% in 2017 to $29 billion, according to new figures released by the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on US-China Relations. This is the first annual decline in Chinese investment in the US since 2009, and the lowest level since 2009. The fall in Chinese investment was driven by a number of factors, including the Trump administration's tough stance on trade and investment, as well as the Chinese government's efforts to reduce capital outflows. The Trump administration has taken a number of steps to restrict Chinese investment in the US, including increasing scrutiny of foreign investment deals and tightening export controls. The Chinese government has also taken steps to reduce capital outflows, including imposing new restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. The decline in Chinese investment in the US is likely to have a significant impact on the US economy. Chinese investment has been a major source of job creation and economic growth in the US in recent years. The fall in Chinese investment is likely to lead to job losses and slower economic growth in the US. The decline in Chinese investment in the US is also likely to have a significant impact on US-China relations. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices, and the decline in Chinese investment is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. The fall in Chinese investment in the US is a major development with significant implications for the US economy and US-China relations. It is important to understand the causes of this decline and to assess its potential impact. In addition to the factors mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that may have contributed to the decline in Chinese investment in the US. These include the rising cost of labor in China, the increasing availability of investment opportunities in other countries, and the uncertainty surrounding the future of US-China relations. It is important to note that the decline in Chinese investment in the US does not necessarily mean that Chinese companies are losing interest in the US market. Chinese companies are still investing in the US, but they are doing so at a slower pace and with more caution. The decline in Chinese investment in the US is a complex issue with a number of causes. It is important to understand the factors behind this decline and to assess its potential impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Venezuela elections neither 'free nor fair', says US","Venezuela Elections Declared 'Neither Free Nor Fair' by US The United States has denounced the recent Venezuelan presidential elections as ""neither free nor fair,"" citing widespread irregularities and the imprisonment of political opponents. In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the elections ""were not conducted in a free and fair manner."" He pointed to the jailing of opposition candidates, the lack of independent election observers, and the reports of voter fraud. ""The United States does not recognize the results of these elections,"" Blinken said. ""We stand with the Venezuelan people and their desire for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law."" The elections, held on November 21, saw incumbent President Nicolás Maduro claiming victory with over 82% of the vote. However, the opposition and international observers have widely criticized the results, alleging that they were rigged in favor of Maduro. The US statement echoed the concerns of the Organization of American States (OAS), which issued a report last week saying that the elections ""did not meet minimum standards for a democratic process."" The OAS also called for new elections to be held. The Venezuelan government has rejected the criticisms, accusing the US and the OAS of interfering in its internal affairs. Maduro has vowed to remain in office and has called for the opposition to recognize his victory. The international condemnation of the elections has put further pressure on Maduro, who is already facing economic sanctions and a campaign of diplomatic isolation. The US and other countries have imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry, which is the country's main source of revenue. The Venezuelan election crisis comes amid a broader political and economic crisis in the country. The country has been plagued by hyperinflation, food shortages, and a lack of basic necessities. The crisis has led to a mass exodus of Venezuelans, many of whom have fled to neighboring countries. The US statement said the Venezuelan people ""deserve the right to freely choose their own leaders and their own future."" It called on the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners, respect the rule of law, and allow for new elections. ""The United States will continue to work with the international community to support the Venezuelan people and their aspiration for a better future,"" the statement concluded.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Edwin Poots: Arlene Foster's exit is 'rough and tumble' of politics,"Edwin Poots: Arlene Foster's exit is 'rough and tumble' of politics Edwin Poots has said the ousting of Arlene Foster as DUP leader is part of the ""rough and tumble"" of politics. Mrs Foster announced her resignation on Wednesday after losing a vote of no confidence among party members. Mr Poots, who is the current Agriculture Minister, is seen as a potential successor to Mrs Foster. He told the BBC's Nolan Show that he had ""no intention"" of standing for the leadership, but did not rule it out in the future. ""I don't have ambitions to be leader of the DUP,"" he said. ""I think it's important that whoever takes over this mantle has the full support of the party and unfortunately, at this time, I do not have the full support of the party."" Mr Poots said he had ""huge regard"" for Mrs Foster and described her as a ""formidable politician"". ""I think she's done a great job, particularly in the Brexit negotiations,"" he said. ""But ultimately, the party has decided that they wanted a change and that's the rough and tumble of politics."" Mr Poots said he was ""not surprised"" by Mrs Foster's resignation. ""I think she's been under a lot of pressure for a long time and I think she's made the right decision for her and for the party,"" he said. Mr Poots said he would continue to serve as Agriculture Minister and would support the new leader of the DUP. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" he said. ""I'm committed to serving the people of Northern Ireland and I'm committed to the DUP."" Mrs Foster's resignation comes after a period of turmoil within the DUP. She has been under pressure over her handling of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP has also been divided over its relationship with the Conservative Party. Mrs Foster's resignation is likely to lead to a contest for the leadership of the DUP. Mr Poots is one of the potential candidates, but it is not clear who else will stand. The new leader of the DUP will face a number of challenges, including the ongoing negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol.

NHS Highland's management criticised for keeping members in the dark,"NHS Highland's management has been criticised for keeping members of the public in the dark about the reasons behind the controversial decision to downgrade the accident and emergency department at Caithness General Hospital. The health board announced last week that the A&E department at the hospital in Wick would be downgraded to an urgent care centre, with more serious cases being sent to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. The decision has been met with anger and disappointment by local residents, who say they were not properly consulted about the plans. Now, it has emerged that NHS Highland's management did not tell the public about all of the reasons for the downgrade. In a letter to the health board, Scottish Conservative MSP Edward Mountain said: ""I have been made aware that NHS Highland did not disclose all of the reasons for their decision to downgrade Caithness General Hospital's A&E department to the public. ""This is a serious matter, as it means that the public was not able to make a fully informed decision about the future of their local hospital."" Mountain said that he had been told that NHS Highland had not disclosed the fact that the downgrade was being considered because of a shortage of doctors. He said: ""This is a very important piece of information, and it is essential that the public is made aware of it. ""I am calling on NHS Highland to come clean about the reasons for their decision and to be honest with the public about the challenges that they are facing."" In response, NHS Highland said that it had ""followed a robust and transparent process"" in making the decision to downgrade the A&E department at Caithness General Hospital. A spokesman said: ""The decision was made following a detailed review of the clinical evidence and the needs of the local population. ""We understand that this is a difficult decision for some people, but we believe that it is the right decision for the long-term future of healthcare in Caithness."" The spokesman added that NHS Highland would be holding a public meeting in Wick on 28th February to discuss the decision in more detail. The decision to downgrade the A&E department at Caithness General Hospital is the latest in a series of controversial decisions made by NHS Highland. In recent years, the health board has also closed a number of community hospitals and reduced the number of beds at Raigmore Hospital. These decisions have led to accusations that NHS Highland is centralising healthcare services in Inverness at the expense of rural communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Minister 'abducted' entrepreneur,"Minister 'Abducted' Entrepreneur The BBC has learned that a British entrepreneur was allegedly abducted and held captive for two weeks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The man, identified as Richard Quest, was reportedly working on a business deal in Dubai when he disappeared on March 10. His family and friends became concerned when they could not reach him and alerted the British authorities. According to sources close to the investigation, Quest was abducted by a group of men who claimed to be members of the UAE security forces. He was allegedly taken to a secret location and held against his will for 14 days. During his captivity, Quest is said to have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse. He was reportedly beaten, threatened, and denied food and water. On March 24, Quest was finally released and allowed to return to the UK. He immediately sought medical attention and is now reportedly recovering from his ordeal. The British government has confirmed that it is aware of the allegations and is working closely with the UAE authorities to investigate the incident. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are deeply concerned about the allegations and are providing consular assistance to Mr. Quest and his family."" The UAE government has denied any involvement in the abduction and detention of Quest. A spokesperson for the UAE embassy in London said: ""The UAE authorities have not and would not engage in such behavior. We are committed to the rule of law and the protection of human rights."" The incident has raised serious questions about the safety of British citizens in the UAE. Quest is a respected businessman with no known ties to any criminal activity. His abduction and detention have sent shockwaves through the international community. Human rights groups have condemned the alleged abduction and called for an independent investigation. Amnesty International said: ""The allegations against the UAE authorities are deeply disturbing. The UAE must launch an immediate and impartial investigation and hold those responsible to account."" The case has also strained relations between the UK and the UAE. British officials have called for a full explanation from the UAE authorities, while the UAE has accused the UK of overreacting. The incident is a reminder of the risks involved in doing business in the UAE. While the country is generally considered safe for tourists and investors, there have been instances of harassment, arbitrary detention, and human rights violations. British citizens considering doing business in the UAE are advised to exercise caution and seek professional advice. They should also be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Abandoned BBC Gardeners' World plot an 'urban veg hub',"In the verdant heart of Bristol, an abandoned plot from BBC's iconic 'Gardeners' World' has found a vibrant new purpose as an urban veg hub, offering a lifeline to the community and promoting sustainable living. Once the setting for the beloved gardening show, the plot lay dormant for years, overgrown with weeds and forgotten. However, a passionate group of volunteers, inspired by the show's legacy, transformed the neglected space into a thriving community asset. The hub is now a bustling space, where rows of vegetables, fruits, and herbs flourish. From plump tomatoes to crisp lettuce, the plot produces an abundance of fresh and organic produce, available to residents at affordable prices. Beyond its role as a food source, the hub fosters a sense of community and shared purpose. Volunteers from all walks of life work together to tend to the plants, sharing their knowledge and experience. Residents can participate in workshops, learn about gardening techniques, and connect with like-minded individuals. The project has also been instrumental in addressing food insecurity in the area. By providing affordable produce, the hub helps reduce the financial burden on families and ensures that everyone has access to healthy and nutritious food. Moreover, the hub promotes sustainable practices, reducing food miles and fostering environmental awareness. The plot uses compost from local sources, collects rainwater for irrigation, and employs natural pest control methods. By demonstrating these principles, the hub encourages residents to adopt sustainable habits in their own gardens. The urban veg hub has become an integral part of the community, transforming a forgotten space into a hub of life and sustainability. It serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of 'Gardeners' World' and the power of community to create positive change. As the sun sets over Bristol, casting a warm glow upon the verdant plot, the urban veg hub stands as a beacon of hope, nourishment, and community spirit.

Snowdon motorists 'towed' if they park illegally at Pen-y-Pass,"Snowdon motorists face being 'towed' if they park illegally at Pen-y-Pass Motorists who park illegally at the popular Snowdon beauty spot Pen-y-Pass could be towed away this summer, the authorities have warned. Snowdonia National Park Authority has announced it will be taking a tougher stance on illegal parking in the area, which has become a major problem in recent years. Last summer, hundreds of vehicles were parked illegally on the A4086 at Pen-y-Pass, causing long tailbacks and putting other road users at risk. In response, the National Park Authority is introducing a new scheme which will see illegally parked vehicles towed away. The scheme will be in operation from July 29th until September 4th, and will be enforced by Snowdonia National Park Authority rangers and North Wales Police. Vehicles parked on double yellow lines, in lay-bys, or on grass verges will be targeted by the scheme. Motorists who have their vehicles towed away will have to pay a release fee of £150, plus any additional storage charges. The National Park Authority is urging motorists to park responsibly and follow the directions of the rangers and police. A spokesperson for the National Park Authority said: ""Illegal parking at Pen-y-Pass is a major problem which we are determined to tackle. ""We have tried a number of different measures to discourage people from parking illegally, but unfortunately they have not been successful. ""This new scheme is a last resort, but we believe it is necessary to protect the environment and the safety of other road users. ""We would urge motorists to park responsibly and follow the directions of the rangers and police."" The National Park Authority is also reminding motorists that there are a number of alternative parking options available at Pen-y-Pass. These include the car park at the Pen-y-Pass Youth Hostel, which has a capacity of 200 vehicles, and the car park at the Snowdon Mountain Railway station, which has a capacity of 100 vehicles. Motorists can also park at the Llanberis Lake Railway station, which is a short walk from Pen-y-Pass.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Catalonia ex-officials freed by Belgian judge,"Catalonia ex-officials freed by Belgian judge after extradition suspended A Belgian judge has freed eight Catalan ex-officials wanted by Spain on charges related to a failed independence referendum. The judge ruled that extradition was suspended because there was a risk they would not receive a fair trial in Spain. The officials were arrested in Brussels in October and have been in custody since then. They are accused of rebellion and misuse of public funds over the Catalan government's attempt to hold an independence referendum in 2017. The Spanish government has condemned the Belgian court's decision, saying it is ""an affront to the rule of law"". The eight officials are: Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia Antoni Comín, the former regional minister for health Lluís Puig, the former regional minister for culture Meritxell Serret, the former regional minister for agriculture Clara Ponsatí, the former regional minister for education Antoni Comín, the former regional minister for health Lluis Puig, the former regional minister for culture Meritxell Serret, the former regional minister for agriculture Clara Ponsatí, the former regional minister for education The officials have all denied the charges against them and say they are being politically persecuted by the Spanish government. The Belgian court's decision is a major blow to the Spanish government's efforts to prosecute the Catalan separatists. It is unclear what will happen to the officials now that they have been released. They could still be extradited to Spain if the Belgische Hof van Cassatie, Belgium's highest court, overturns the lower court's decision. However, it is also possible that they will be granted asylum in Belgium or another country. The decision has been welcomed by the Catalan government, which said it ""respects the independence of the Belgian judiciary"". The Spanish government has said it will continue to pursue the extradition of the officials. The Catalan independence referendum was held on 1 October 2017, despite being declared illegal by the Spanish government. The referendum resulted in a vote in favor of independence, but the Spanish government has refused to recognize the result. The Catalan government's attempt to declare independence from Spain has led to a political crisis between the two sides. The Spanish government has imposed direct rule on Catalonia and has arrested several Catalan leaders. The Catalan independence movement has been largely peaceful, but there have been some violent protests. The decision by the Belgian judge to release the Catalan ex-officials is likely to further escalate tensions between Spain and Catalonia.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Why charities are counting the costs of council cuts,"Why Charities Are Counting the Costs of Council Cuts Local authorities across the UK are facing severe budget cuts, and the impact is being felt by charities that provide vital services to communities. These cuts are forcing charities to make difficult decisions that are affecting their ability to deliver essential support. One of the most significant impacts of council cuts is the loss of funding for frontline services. Many charities rely on this funding to provide crucial services such as homelessness support, mental health services, and youth services. Without this funding, charities are struggling to meet the needs of those who rely on them. For example, the Trussell Trust, a charity that operates a network of food banks, has reported a significant increase in demand for its services in recent years. This increase is thought to be partly due to the impact of council cuts, which have reduced the support available to low-income families. In addition to funding cuts, charities are also facing increased competition for funding from other sources. This is because local councils are increasingly turning to private sector providers to deliver services, which means that there is less money available for charities. Charities are also facing rising costs, such as the cost of rent, utilities, and staff salaries. This means that they are having to do more with less, which is putting a strain on their resources. The impact of these challenges is being felt by the people who rely on charities for support. Many charities are having to reduce their services or close altogether, which means that people are losing out on the vital support they need. For example, a recent study by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) found that more than half of charities have had to reduce their services or close in the past year. The government has acknowledged the impact that council cuts are having on charities, and it has announced some measures to help. However, these measures have been criticized by some charities as being insufficient. Charities are calling on the government to do more to support them, and they are urging local councils to think carefully about the impact of their cuts on the most vulnerable in society. Until more support is available, charities will continue to struggle to meet the needs of those who rely on them. This will have a devastating impact on the most vulnerable in our communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Fifa indictment: What's in it,"Fifa indictment: What's in it The 47-count indictment against FIFA officials unsealed in the United States on Wednesday details a 24-year scheme of corruption involving bribes and kickbacks worth more than $150m (£98m). Key accusations The indictment accuses 14 current and former FIFA officials and sports marketing executives of accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for their support of the South Africa bid for the 2010 World Cup and other tournaments. It also alleges that: Bribes were paid to FIFA officials in exchange for votes in favour of Qatar's bid for the 2022 World Cup. Officials took bribes for the sale of television and marketing rights for FIFA tournaments. Officials exploited their positions to secure commercial contracts for themselves and their associates. FIFA awarded contracts to companies owned by officials or their associates, even when they were not the lowest bidders. Who is charged? The 14 individuals charged in the indictment include: Jeffrey Webb, former president of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Jack Warner, former vice-president of FIFA Chuck Blazer, former general secretary of CONCACAF Michel Platini, current president of UEFA Sepp Blatter, former president of FIFA What happens next? The individuals charged in the indictment are due to appear in court in New York on 3 December. FIFA has said it will cooperate with the US investigation and has appointed an independent ethics committee to look into the allegations.

UK diesel car sales fall by nearly a third in October,"UK diesel car sales fall by nearly a third in October Sales of new diesel cars in the UK have fallen by nearly a third in October, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Just 9.1% of new cars sold in October were diesel, down from 13.4% in the same month last year. This is the lowest market share for diesel cars since records began in 1997. The decline in diesel sales has been driven by a number of factors, including concerns about air pollution and the rising cost of fuel. In recent years, a number of cities have introduced or expanded clean air zones, which charge drivers of older, more polluting vehicles. The government has also announced plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. This has led many consumers to delay buying a new diesel car, in anticipation of the ban. The decline in diesel sales has been welcomed by environmental campaigners. They argue that diesel cars are a major source of air pollution, which can contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. However, the decline in diesel sales has also raised concerns about the future of the UK automotive industry. Diesel cars have traditionally been popular with British drivers, and their decline could lead to job losses in the manufacturing sector. The SMMT has called on the government to provide more support for the automotive industry, including investment in research and development of new technologies. ""The UK automotive industry is facing a perfect storm of challenges, including the decline in diesel sales, the global chip shortage, and the rising cost of raw materials,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. ""The government must provide more support for the industry if we are to maintain our position as a global leader in automotive manufacturing."" The decline in diesel sales is likely to continue in the coming months. In November, the government is due to introduce a new Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) system, which will increase the tax on diesel cars. This is likely to further deter consumers from buying diesel vehicles.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Budget 2017: Tax on takeaway boxes to be considered,"Chancellor Philip Hammond is considering introducing a tax on takeaway food and drink containers as part of plans to tackle plastic waste. The levy could be applied to single-use items such as plastic cups, straws, and food boxes, and would be similar to the 5p charge on plastic bags introduced in 2015. The Treasury is understood to be looking at a range of options, including a flat rate levy on all takeaway containers or a higher charge on items made from non-recyclable materials. The move is part of a wider government drive to reduce plastic pollution, which has been linked to a range of environmental problems, including damage to marine life and the release of harmful chemicals into the food chain. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We are committed to taking action to reduce plastic waste and we are considering a range of options, including a levy on takeaway food and drink containers."" The proposal has been welcomed by environmental groups, who say it could help to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated by the hospitality industry. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the Surfers Against Sewage campaign group, said: ""A tax on takeaway containers is a positive step towards reducing the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans and on our beaches."" ""We hope that the government will introduce a levy that is both ambitious and effective in reducing the use of single-use plastics,"" he added. The hospitality industry has expressed concern about the potential impact of a tax on takeaway containers, warning that it could lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said: ""We are concerned about the potential impact of a tax on takeaway containers on our members, many of whom are already struggling with rising costs.""

Ofwat blamed for high water bills by committee of MPs,"A committee of MPs has accused the water regulator Ofwat of failing to prevent high water bills for customers. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said in a report that Ofwat had ""not been sufficiently robust"" in regulating the water industry, which had led to ""higher bills for customers than necessary"". The committee also said that Ofwat had been too willing to allow water companies to increase their profits, and that it had not done enough to protect consumers from unfair charges. The report comes after a number of water companies have been criticized for increasing their bills while their profits have also risen. For example, in 2021, Thames Water increased its bills by an average of 2.5%, while its profits rose by 13%. The PAC said that Ofwat had ""failed to take effective action"" to prevent these kinds of increases, and that it had ""not been sufficiently responsive to the concerns of consumers"". The committee also said that Ofwat had not done enough to encourage water companies to invest in their infrastructure, which had led to leaks and other problems. The report concludes by saying that Ofwat needs to ""take a more proactive approach to regulation"" and that it needs to ""do more to protect consumers from unfair charges"". Ofwat has said that it accepts the findings of the report and that it will ""take action to address the concerns raised"". However, the committee has said that it will continue to monitor Ofwat's progress and that it will ""hold the regulator to account"" if it does not make the necessary improvements. The PAC's report is the latest in a series of criticisms of Ofwat. In 2019, the National Audit Office (NAO) said that Ofwat had ""not been effective in regulating the water industry"" and that it had ""failed to protect consumers from high bills"". The NAO also said that Ofwat had been ""too willing to allow water companies to increase their profits"" and that it had ""not done enough to encourage water companies to invest in their infrastructure"". Ofwat has said that it is ""committed to protecting consumers"" and that it is ""working to improve the way it regulates the water industry"". However, the PAC's report suggests that Ofwat still has a long way to go before it can be considered an effective regulator.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Shark nations failing on conservation pledges,"Shark nations failing on conservation pledges Conservation commitments made by governments to safeguard shark populations are falling short, according to a new report by the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. The report, published on Tuesday, assesses the progress made by 23 countries that have signed up to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It found that while some nations have made significant strides in implementing their pledges, many are lagging behind. The report found that only five of the 23 countries have fully implemented their CITES commitments. These countries are Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, and the United States. The report found that some countries are failing to implement their CITES commitments due to a lack of resources or political will. The report also found that illegal fishing is a major threat to sharks. The report found that illegal fishing is responsible for the deaths of an estimated 100 million sharks each year. The report calls on governments to do more to combat illegal fishing and to implement their CITES commitments. The report comes as the world's shark populations face a number of threats, including overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), one-quarter of all shark species are now threatened with extinction. The report from Traffic highlights the need for urgent action to protect sharks. Governments must do more to implement their CITES commitments and to combat illegal fishing. The report also calls on consumers to make sustainable seafood choices. Consumers can help to protect sharks by choosing to buy seafood from fisheries that use sustainable practices. Sharks play a vital role in marine ecosystems. They help to keep populations of other fish in check and they play a role in nutrient cycling. The loss of sharks would have a devastating impact on marine ecosystems and on the livelihoods of people who depend on the ocean.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Carwyn Jones: Wales 'not too poor to be independent',"Wales has the potential to be a wealthy and prosperous independent nation, former First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.

""We have a highly skilled workforce, a strong economy, and a wealth of natural resources,"" he said. ""We also have a proud history and a distinct culture."" Jones said that Wales was ""not too poor to be independent."" He pointed out that the Welsh economy was growing faster than the UK economy as a whole, and that Wales had a higher GDP per capita than many other European countries. ""We have the resources and the talent to succeed as an independent nation,"" he said. ""It is time for us to take control of our own destiny."" Jones's comments come amid a growing debate about the future of Wales. The Welsh independence movement has gained momentum in recent years, and a number of polls have suggested that a majority of Welsh people now support independence. However, there are also those who believe that Wales is not yet ready for independence. They argue that the Welsh economy is too small and too dependent on the UK government. Jones acknowledged that there were challenges facing Wales, but he said that these challenges could be overcome. He called on the Welsh people to be ""bold and ambitious"" and to ""seize the opportunity"" to create a better future for Wales. ""We can be a successful and prosperous independent nation,"" he said. ""Let us work together to make it happen."" Jones's comments have been welcomed by some Welsh independence supporters. However, they have also been criticized by those who believe that Wales is not yet ready for independence. The debate about the future of Wales is likely to continue for some time.

Female MPs write letter 'in solidarity' with Meghan amid media scrutiny,"Female MPs have written a letter to the Duchess of Sussex expressing their ""solidarity"" amid intense media scrutiny. The letter, signed by 72 MPs from all parties, was sent to Meghan on Monday and expresses concern about the ""distressing"" treatment she has received from the media. It comes after Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, gave a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey in which they accused the royal family of racism and neglect. The letter from the MPs states that they are ""deeply concerned"" about the ""tone and nature"" of the media coverage of Meghan, which they say has been ""offensive and unacceptable"". They write: ""We are particularly concerned about the way in which the media has treated your mental health. We believe that you have been subjected to unfair and disproportionate scrutiny, and that this has had a significant impact on your well-being."" The MPs go on to say that they are ""proud"" of Meghan for speaking out about her experiences, and that they believe her story will help to ""inspire others who have been subjected to similar treatment"". They add: ""We want to let you know that we stand with you and that we will continue to support you in any way we can."" The letter is signed by MPs from all parties, including Labour, the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party. It is the latest in a series of public statements of support for Meghan from high-profile figures. In recent weeks, the Duchess has also received messages of solidarity from the likes of Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Beyoncé. The media coverage of Meghan has been the subject of much debate in recent months. Some commentators have accused the media of being racist and sexist in its treatment of the Duchess, while others have defended the media's right to report on the royal family.

Sudan death penalty reignites Islam apostasy debate,"Sudan's Death Penalty Reignites Islam Apostasy Debate The execution of a Sudanese woman convicted of apostasy has sparked a fierce debate about the role of religion in the country's legal system. Noura Hussein was found guilty of renouncing Islam in May 2022 and sentenced to death by hanging. Her execution on Wednesday has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights groups and cast a spotlight on Sudan's controversial apostasy laws. Apostasy, the act of renouncing one's religion, is a serious crime in many Muslim-majority countries, including Sudan. While the Quran does not explicitly prescribe a punishment for apostasy, some Islamic scholars argue that it is punishable by death. In Sudan, apostasy is a capital offense under Article 126 of the penal code. Noura Hussein's case has brought the issue of apostasy to the forefront of public discourse in Sudan. Her supporters argue that her conviction and execution were unjust and violate her fundamental rights to freedom of religion and belief. They point out that she was reportedly forced to marry at a young age and that she had never renounced Islam. Opponents of apostasy laws, both within Sudan and internationally, argue that they are archaic and discriminatory. They argue that people should be free to choose their own religion without fear of persecution. They also point out that apostasy laws are often used to target religious minorities or dissenters. The debate over apostasy in Sudan is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides. Supporters of apostasy laws argue that they are necessary to protect the integrity of Islam and prevent religious strife. Opponents argue that they are a violation of human rights and that they serve only to suppress dissent. The execution of Noura Hussein has reignited the debate over apostasy and is likely to continue to be a source of controversy in Sudan and beyond. The case has raised important questions about the role of religion in the legal system, the rights of religious minorities, and the limits of freedom of expression. It is important to note that different interpretations exist within Islamic jurisprudence regarding the punishment for apostasy, ranging from death to imprisonment or no punishment at all. The specific interpretation adopted in a particular country is often influenced by cultural, historical, and political factors. The debate over apostasy in Sudan is a reminder of the complex and often conflicting relationship between religion and the law. It is a debate that is likely to continue for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Restricted embryo growth 'predicts miscarriage risk',"Restricted embryo growth 'predicts miscarriage risk' Embryos that fail to grow properly in the early stages of pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage, research suggests. Scientists found that the size of the embryo at six weeks was linked to the likelihood of it surviving to birth. Embryos that were in the smallest 25% for their gestational age were 10 times more likely to miscarry than those in the largest 25%, the study found. The findings, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, could help doctors identify women at high risk of miscarriage and provide them with closer monitoring. Around 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with most occurring in the first trimester. The exact cause of miscarriage is often unknown, although it is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including genetic abnormalities, hormonal imbalances and infections. The new study involved over 10,000 women who had early pregnancy scans at six weeks. The researchers measured the size of the embryo and followed the women until they gave birth or miscarried. They found that the risk of miscarriage was significantly higher in women whose embryos were in the smallest 25% for their gestational age. For example, the miscarriage rate was 5.4% in women whose embryos were in the smallest 25%, compared to 0.5% in women whose embryos were in the largest 25%. The researchers also found that the link between embryo size and miscarriage risk was independent of other factors known to increase the risk of miscarriage, such as maternal age, smoking and obesity. This suggests that embryo size is an important independent predictor of miscarriage risk. The researchers say their findings could help doctors identify women at high risk of miscarriage and provide them with closer monitoring. They believe that this could lead to a reduction in the number of miscarriages. Dr Alexander Heazell, from the University of Manchester, who led the study, said: ""Our findings suggest that embryo size at six weeks is a strong predictor of miscarriage risk. ""This could help us to identify women at high risk of miscarriage and provide them with closer monitoring. ""This could lead to a reduction in the number of miscarriages."" Dr Pat O'Brien, a consultant gynecologist at Tommy's, a charity that funds research into miscarriage, premature birth and stillbirth, said: ""This is a very important study that adds to our understanding of the causes of miscarriage.

Supplier of halal meat containing pork DNA is named,"Supplier of Halal Meat Containing Pork DNA is Named A supplier of halal meat products has been named after it was discovered that some of its products contained pork DNA. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that tests had found pork DNA in a number of products supplied by the company, which is based in the West Midlands. The FSA said that the company had been ""cooperating fully"" with its investigation and had recalled all of the affected products. The FSA said that the pork DNA was found in ""a small number of samples"" of halal meat products. It said that the meat had been supplied to a number of businesses, including butchers, restaurants, and takeaways. The FSA said that it was ""disappointed"" that the company had failed to meet the required standards and that it would be taking enforcement action. The FSA said that it would not be naming the company at this stage as its investigation was ongoing. However, it said that it would be publishing the name of the company once its investigation had been completed. The FSA said that it was ""committed to ensuring that the food we eat is safe and what it says it is"". It said that it would continue to work with businesses to ensure that they meet the required standards. The FSA said that consumers who are concerned about the safety of halal meat products should contact their local authority. The FSA said that it was ""working closely"" with the local authority to ensure that the affected products are removed from sale. The FSA said that it would be providing further updates on its investigation as they became available. The discovery of pork DNA in halal meat products has raised concerns about the safety of halal meat products. Halal meat is meat that has been prepared in accordance with Islamic law. Islamic law requires that animals be slaughtered in a specific way and that the meat be drained of blood. Pork is forbidden in Islam, so halal meat products should not contain any pork DNA. The discovery of pork DNA in halal meat products has led to calls for stricter regulation of the halal meat industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Young 'to be poorer than parents at every stage of life',"Young people in the UK are on course to be poorer than their parents at every stage of life, according to a major new study. The research, published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), found that young people born in the 1980s and 1990s are likely to have lower incomes, own fewer assets, and save less for retirement than their parents did at the same age. The study found that the average income of young people in the UK has fallen by 10% since the 1980s, while the average wealth of young people has fallen by 25%. The IFS said that the decline in young people's incomes and wealth is due to a number of factors, including: Rising inequality: The gap between the rich and the poor has widened in recent decades, and young people are more likely to be at the bottom of the income distribution. Stagnant wages: Wages have not kept pace with inflation in recent years, which has made it harder for young people to afford housing and other essential expenses. Rising housing costs: The cost of housing has risen sharply in recent years, making it harder for young people to save for a deposit. A lack of affordable childcare: The cost of childcare is a major barrier to young people who want to work. The IFS said that the decline in young people's incomes and wealth is a major concern, as it will have a negative impact on their future financial security. The study found that young people who are born into poverty are more likely to remain in poverty as adults. The IFS said that this is because poverty can have a negative impact on children's education, health, and development. The IFS said that the government needs to take action to address the decline in young people's incomes and wealth. The study recommended that the government should: Increase the minimum wage Build more affordable housing Reduce the cost of childcare Invest in early childhood education The IFS said that these measures would help to improve the financial security of young people and give them a better chance of success in life.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Pro-Putin social media campaign hijacked by critics,"Pro-Putin Social Media Campaign Backfires A Russian social media campaign aimed at boosting support for President Vladimir Putin inadvertently backfired, as critics hijacked the hashtag and flooded it with anti-war and anti-Putin messages. The campaign, launched on the popular social media platform Telegram, involved the use of the hashtag #WeAreTogether and featured positive messages about Putin's leadership. However, critics quickly seized the opportunity to turn the hashtag against the Kremlin. Using the #WeAreTogether hashtag, they posted videos of Russian soldiers being killed or captured in Ukraine, as well as images of the devastation caused by the war. They also shared messages criticizing Putin's policies and calling for an end to the conflict. The campaign quickly went viral, with the hashtag #WeAreTogether becoming one of the top trending topics on Telegram. The Kremlin was forced to react, with officials accusing critics of ""spreading fake news"" and ""undermining the morale"" of Russian troops. However, the damage had already been done. The campaign had exposed the deep divisions within Russian society and had given a platform to dissenting voices that are often suppressed in the country. The hijacking of the social media campaign is the latest example of the Kremlin's failure to control the narrative online. Despite its efforts to crack down on dissent, social media has become a powerful tool for Russians to express their views and challenge the government. The Kremlin's inability to control the online space is a significant threat to its authority. As more and more Russians turn to social media for information and debate, it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to maintain its grip on power. The hijacking of the #WeAreTogether campaign is a warning shot to the Kremlin. If it wants to maintain its control over Russian society, it needs to find a way to address the concerns of its critics and to allow for greater freedom of expression online.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Step down now, David Cameron urges President Assad","British Prime Minister David Cameron has called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down ""immediately"" for the sake of his country. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr. Cameron said that President Assad had lost all legitimacy and that his continued presence in power was making it impossible to find a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis. ""He has lost the support of his own people and the respect of the international community,"" Mr. Cameron said. ""He can no longer be a part of Syria's future."" Mr. Cameron's comments came after a suspected chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, which killed hundreds of people. The Syrian government has denied responsibility for the attack, but the United States and other Western powers have blamed the regime. Mr. Cameron said that the chemical weapons attack was ""a crime against humanity"" and that President Assad must be held accountable.

'Lack of evidence' holding back cannabis medicines,"Lack of evidence' holding back cannabis medicines Despite growing interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis, a lack of high-quality clinical evidence is hindering the development and approval of cannabis-based medicines. ""There is a lot of anecdotal evidence and some small studies suggesting that cannabis may be helpful for a variety of conditions, such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy,"" said Dr. David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London. ""But we need more rigorous research to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal doses and formulations for different conditions."" One of the biggest challenges in conducting clinical trials on cannabis is the difficulty in obtaining a standardized product. Cannabis is a complex plant that contains hundreds of different compounds, and the relative proportions of these compounds can vary depending on the strain, growing conditions, and extraction method. This makes it difficult to compare results from different studies and to determine the specific compounds responsible for any therapeutic effects. Another challenge is the stigma surrounding cannabis use. In many countries, cannabis is still classified as an illegal drug, which makes it difficult for researchers to obtain funding and approval for clinical trials. This stigma also discourages some patients from participating in research studies. Despite these challenges, there is growing interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis. In recent years, several countries have legalized medical cannabis, and the number of clinical trials is increasing. ""We are starting to see more high-quality research on cannabis,"" said Dr. Nutt. ""This research is helping us to better understand the potential benefits and risks of cannabis use, and it is paving the way for the development of new cannabis-based medicines."" One area where cannabis has shown promise is in the treatment of chronic pain. A number of studies have found that cannabis can be effective in reducing pain intensity and improving function in patients with conditions such as fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and cancer pain. Cannabis has also shown promise in the treatment of epilepsy. A number of studies have found that cannabis can reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children and adults with epilepsy. In addition to its potential therapeutic benefits, cannabis also has a number of potential side effects. These side effects can include dry mouth, dizziness, impaired coordination, and anxiety. In some cases, cannabis use can also lead to more serious side effects, such as psychosis and cardiovascular problems. It is important to note that cannabis is not a cure-all for any condition. It is also important to be aware of the potential side effects of cannabis use. If you are considering using cannabis for medical purposes, it is important to talk to your doctor first.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Legacy inquests: Families launch legal bid over funding,"Families bereaved by the 7/7 London bombings are launching a legal bid to force the government to properly fund legacy inquests into the atrocity. The inquests, which are due to start in September, will examine the events leading up to the attacks, the emergency response and the long-term impact on the victims' families. However, the government has allocated just £3.5 million to cover the costs of the inquests, which are expected to last for at least two years. The families argue that this is not enough money to ensure that the inquests are properly conducted and that all the necessary evidence is heard. They are seeking a judicial review of the government's funding decision, arguing that it is irrational and unlawful. The legal challenge is being supported by the charity Inquest, which provides legal advice and support to bereaved families. Inquest's director, Deborah Coles, said: ""The government's decision to allocate just £3.5 million to cover the costs of the 7/7 inquests is a disgrace. ""These inquests are of vital importance to the families of the victims. They need to know what happened, why it happened and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. ""The government's funding decision is an insult to the families and to the memory of their loved ones."" The families' legal challenge is the latest in a series of disputes over the funding of legacy inquests. In 2019, the government agreed to pay £10 million to cover the costs of the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster. However, the government has refused to provide similar funding for the inquests into other historical events, such as the Bloody Sunday killings and the Birmingham pub bombings. The families argue that the government's failure to properly fund legacy inquests is a denial of justice. They say that the inquests are an essential part of the process of healing and reconciliation, and that they should not be denied the opportunity to find out the truth about what happened to their loved ones. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that legacy inquests are properly funded. However, it has also said that it must balance the need for justice with the need to be fiscally responsible. The legal challenge brought by the 7/7 families is likely to be a test case for the government's approach to funding legacy inquests. If the families are successful, it could set a precedent for other families seeking to force the government to provide more funding for legacy inquests.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Disabled man's holiday prize 'not wheelchair friendly',"A disabled man has canceled his holiday prize after the hotel he was supposed to stay at was not wheelchair friendly. John Dickinson, 61, from Wigan, won an all-expenses-paid trip to the Woodlands Hotel in Worsley, Greater Manchester, in a radio competition. However, when he checked the hotel's website, he realized that there were no accessible rooms available. ""I was really disappointed,"" said John, who has muscular dystrophy. ""I've been looking forward to this holiday for months."" The hotel has since apologized and offered John a full refund. But John says he is still angry that he was not told about the lack of accessible rooms before he booked the trip. ""I feel like I've been discriminated against,"" he said. ""I should have been told about this upfront."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says that businesses must make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. This includes providing accessible rooms in hotels and other public places. A spokesperson for the EHRC said: ""We are concerned to hear about Mr. Dickinson's experience. Businesses have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. This includes providing accessible rooms in hotels."" John's case highlights the importance of businesses being aware of their obligations under the Equality Act. It also shows that disabled people are still facing discrimination when it comes to accessing public places.

Spinal muscular atrophy: Families plead for drug to slow disease,"In a heart-wrenching plea, families affected by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are urging the government to provide access to a life-changing drug that could slow the progression of the debilitating condition. SMA is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. It primarily affects infants and young children, and its severity can vary widely. In its most severe form, SMA can be fatal within the first two years of life. There is currently no cure for SMA, but there are treatments available that can help to manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. However, these treatments are often very expensive and can have significant side effects. Nusinersen, a drug that has been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of SMA, is not currently funded by the National Health Service (NHS). This means that families who want to access the drug have to pay for it privately, which can cost tens of thousands of pounds per year. The families of children with SMA are now calling on the government to make nusinersen available on the NHS. They say that the drug could make a huge difference to the lives of their loved ones, giving them the chance to live longer, more fulfilling lives. ""My son, Oscar, was diagnosed with SMA when he was just a few months old,"" said Sarah Harrison, Oscar's mother. ""He's now four years old and he's doing really well, but I know that without nusinersen, his condition would be much worse. I can't bear to think about what would happen to him if we couldn't afford to pay for his treatment."" Another family, the Smiths, have set up a petition calling on the government to fund nusinersen on the NHS. The petition has already gained over 100,000 signatures. ""Our daughter, Amy, was diagnosed with SMA when she was just six months old,"" said Amy's father, John Smith. ""She's now two years old and she's already lost a lot of her strength. We're terrified of what the future holds for her if she doesn't get access to nusinersen."" The government has said that it is ""committed to ensuring that all patients have access to the best possible care."" However, it has not yet made a decision on whether or not to fund nusinersen on the NHS. The families of children with SMA are now waiting anxiously for the government's decision. They know that time is running out for their loved ones and they are desperate for access to the drug that could make such a difference to their lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Barclays 'fails to fund' London cycle hire expansion,"Barclays has pulled out of a deal to fund London's cycle hire scheme expansion, leaving the future of the project in doubt. The bank had been due to provide £30 million to support the expansion of the scheme, which would have seen the number of bikes and docking stations increased by 50%. However, Barclays has now informed Transport for London (TfL) that it will not be able to provide the funding. TfL said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision and that it was now ""considering our options"". The expansion of the cycle hire scheme was due to begin in the spring of 2020. It would have seen the number of bikes increased from 11,500 to 17,500 and the number of docking stations increased from 750 to 1,100. The expansion was part of TfL's plans to make London a more cycle-friendly city. TfL said it was ""committed to making cycling a more attractive and accessible option for Londoners"". It added that it would ""continue to work on plans to expand the cycle hire scheme, and will explore all options to secure the necessary funding"". Barclays said it had made the decision to withdraw from the funding agreement ""after careful consideration"". It said it was ""committed to supporting cycling in London"" but that it had ""other priorities"" at this time. The news of Barclays' withdrawal from the funding agreement has been met with disappointment from cycling campaigners. The London Cycling Campaign said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the news and that the expansion of the cycle hire scheme was ""essential"" to making London a more cycle-friendly city. It added that it would be ""working with TfL to explore all options to secure the necessary funding"".

Care home arrests over modern day slavery claims,"Over 100 arrests have been made in connection with suspected modern slavery offences in care homes across the UK. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the arrests formed part of Operation Fort, which was set up in 2021 to tackle the exploitation of vulnerable adults in the care sector. The NCA said care home managers, owners and recruiters were among those arrested. The charges being investigated include modern slavery, human trafficking, fraud and abuse. The NCA also said that it had identified over 300 potential victims, who are now receiving support. The arrests come after a BBC Panorama investigation in 2022 exposed concerns about the treatment of vulnerable adults in care homes. The investigation found that some care homes were employing staff who were not properly trained and who were paid less than the minimum wage. The government has since announced a series of measures to tackle the issue of modern slavery in care homes. These include: A new offence of exploiting vulnerable adults in care settings Tougher penalties for those who abuse or neglect vulnerable adults Increased funding for the NCA to investigate modern slavery offences A new statutory code of practice for the care sector The NCA said that Operation Fort was an ongoing investigation and that it was working with partners to identify and disrupt modern slavery and human trafficking networks. The NCA's director of modern slavery and human trafficking, Will Kerr, said: ""Modern slavery is a hidden crime that can affect anyone. It is particularly distressing when it occurs in care settings, where vulnerable people should be safe and protected. ""Operation Fort is a significant step in our efforts to tackle this issue. We are working closely with our partners to identify and disrupt modern slavery and human trafficking networks, and to safeguard victims."" The Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab, said: ""Modern slavery is a cruel and inhuman crime. It is particularly abhorrent when it occurs in care settings, where vulnerable people should be safe and protected. ""The arrests made today are a clear signal that we will not tolerate this abuse. We are working closely with the NCA and other partners to bring those responsible to justice and to protect victims.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Fruit-shaped sensor 'can improve freshness',"Fruit-shaped sensor can improve freshness A new fruit-shaped sensor can help to improve the freshness of fruit and vegetables. The sensor, which is about the size of a grape, can be inserted into the fruit or vegetable and will monitor its ripeness. When the fruit or vegetable is ripe, the sensor will send a signal to a smartphone app, which will notify the user. The sensor is made of a biodegradable material and is powered by a small battery. It can be used to monitor a variety of fruits and vegetables, including apples, bananas, avocados, and tomatoes. The sensor was developed by a team of researchers at the University of California, Davis. The researchers say that the sensor can help to reduce food waste by allowing consumers to know when their fruits and vegetables are at their peak ripeness. ""We wanted to create a sensor that was affordable, easy to use, and could provide consumers with real-time information about the freshness of their produce,"" said lead researcher Dr. Changying Li. The sensor is still in the early stages of development, but the researchers are hopeful that it will be commercially available within the next few years. In addition to helping consumers to reduce food waste, the sensor could also be used to improve the quality of food. By monitoring the ripeness of fruits and vegetables, farmers and retailers can ensure that they are harvested and sold at the optimal time. The sensor could also be used to develop new food products. For example, it could be used to create a self-ripening fruit bowl that would automatically adjust the temperature and humidity to keep the fruit fresh. The possibilities for the fruit-shaped sensor are endless. It is a simple but effective tool that could have a major impact on the way we grow, store, and consume food.

Dental surgeons urge England's schools to go sugar-free,"Dental surgeons in England are urging schools to implement sugar-free policies in an effort to combat the alarming rise in childhood tooth decay. According to the British Dental Association (BDA), tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in children, with nearly one in three five-year-olds experiencing the condition. The BDA attributes this surge in decay to the high consumption of sugary foods and drinks, particularly in school settings. Research has shown that children who have sugary snacks and drinks during the school day are at an increased risk of developing cavities. This is because the sugar in these products provides a food source for bacteria that live on the teeth. These bacteria produce acids that erode the tooth enamel, leading to decay. In response to this growing concern, the BDA is calling on schools across England to adopt sugar-free policies. These policies would prohibit the sale and consumption of all sugary foods and drinks on school premises, including in vending machines, canteens, and packed lunches. The BDA believes that sugar-free schools would play a crucial role in reducing tooth decay among children. By eliminating sugary temptations from the school environment, children would be less likely to snack on these unhealthy products and develop cavities. In addition to reducing tooth decay, sugar-free policies would also have a number of other benefits for children. For example, they would help children to develop healthy eating habits, which would benefit their overall health and wellbeing. Sugar-free policies would also reduce the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic diseases that are linked to excessive sugar consumption. The BDA's call for sugar-free schools has been supported by a number of organizations, including the National Health Service (NHS), Public Health England (PHE), and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). These organizations all recognize the importance of reducing sugar consumption among children and believe that sugar-free schools are an effective way to achieve this. The BDA is urging schools to adopt sugar-free policies as soon as possible. The organization has developed a toolkit to help schools to implement these policies effectively. The toolkit includes resources such as sample policies, lesson plans, and posters. The BDA believes that sugar-free schools are a vital step towards improving the oral health of children in England. By eliminating sugary temptations from the school environment, children can be given the best chance of developing healthy teeth and gums.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New whisky distillery built at historic Lindores Abbey,"In a nod to Scotland's rich distilling heritage, a new whisky distillery has been built on the grounds of the historic Lindores Abbey in Fife. The abbey, founded in 1191, is believed to be the birthplace of Scotch whisky, with records indicating that monks there were distilling a spirit known as ""aqua vitae"" in the 15th century. The new distillery, named Lindores Abbey Distillery, is the first to be built on the site in over 500 years. It has been constructed using traditional methods and materials, including locally sourced stone and reclaimed wood from the original abbey buildings. The distillery will produce a single malt Scotch whisky, which will be matured in oak casks for a minimum of three years. The project has been spearheaded by Drew McKenzie Smith, a direct descendant of the monks who first distilled whisky at Lindores Abbey. McKenzie Smith said he was inspired to create the distillery after discovering a reference to the abbey's whisky-making past in a 15th-century manuscript. ""I was fascinated by the idea that Scotch whisky may have originated here at Lindores Abbey,"" said McKenzie Smith. ""I wanted to recreate that spirit and share it with the world."" The distillery has been designed to be as sustainable as possible, with a focus on reducing water and energy consumption. The spent grain from the distilling process will be used to feed cattle on a nearby farm, and the heat generated by the distillery will be used to warm the abbey's visitor center. The Lindores Abbey Distillery is expected to produce around 100,000 liters of whisky per year. The first batch of whisky is expected to be released in 2023. The distillery has been welcomed by the local community and the Scotch whisky industry. The Scotch Whisky Association said it was ""delighted"" to see a new distillery being built on such a historic site. ""Lindores Abbey is a key part of the story of Scotch whisky,"" said Karen Betts, the Scotch Whisky Association's chief executive. ""The new distillery will help to keep that story alive and inspire future generations."" The Lindores Abbey Distillery is open to the public for tours and tastings. Visitors can learn about the history of whisky making at the abbey and see the distilling process in action.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Gay marriage ban 'step too far' says Archbishop of Wales,"The Archbishop of Wales has said that the Church in Wales' decision to ban same-sex marriage is a ""step too far"". John Davies, who is also the Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the vote, which was passed by the Church's governing body, the Governing Body, on Tuesday. ""I believe that the decision to ban same-sex marriage is a step too far,"" he said. ""I believe that the Church should be a place of welcome and inclusion for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation."" Davies is one of a number of senior figures within the Church in Wales who have spoken out against the ban. The Bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the decision, while the Bishop of Bangor, Andy John, said it was a ""missed opportunity"" for the Church to show its love and compassion for all people. The Church in Wales is the third branch of the Anglican Communion to ban same-sex marriage, after the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States. However, it is the first branch of the Anglican Communion to do so since the Scottish Episcopal Church voted in favor of same-sex marriage in 2017. The decision is likely to further divide the Anglican Communion, which is already split on the issue of same-sex marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said that he ""deeply regrets"" the decision, and that it will make it ""harder for us to walk together as a Communion"". The ban is also likely to lead to further calls for the Church in Wales to leave the Anglican Communion. The Bishop of Monmouth, Richard Pain, has said that he believes the Church in Wales is now ""out of step"" with the rest of the Anglican Communion, and that it may need to consider leaving. The decision to ban same-sex marriage is a significant moment in the history of the Church in Wales. It is a decision that will have far-reaching consequences for the Church, both in Wales and internationally.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Australia growth rate falls short of forecasts,"Australia's economic growth rate has slowed more than expected in the final quarter of 2022, falling short of forecasts and raising concerns about the impact of rising interest rates and global economic headwinds. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday that the economy grew by 0.5% in the December quarter, down from 0.8% in the September quarter and below the market consensus forecast of 0.7%. The slowdown was broad-based, with growth in household spending, business investment, and government spending all slowing. Household spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, grew by just 0.3% in the December quarter, down from 0.9% in the September quarter. Business investment also slowed, with spending on new machinery and equipment declining by 0.8% in the December quarter. Government spending grew by just 0.2%, the slowest pace in a year. The slowdown in growth is a concern for policymakers, who are trying to balance the need to control inflation with the need to support economic growth. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has raised interest rates nine times since May 2022 in an effort to curb inflation, which hit a 33-year high of 7.8% in the December quarter. The RBA has warned that further interest rate hikes are likely to be needed in the coming months, which could put further pressure on economic growth. Economists said the December quarter GDP figures were disappointing and raised concerns about the strength of the economy in the coming months. ""The slowdown in growth in the December quarter was more pronounced than expected and suggests that the economy is starting to feel the impact of higher interest rates and the global economic slowdown,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. ""The RBA is likely to remain focused on bringing inflation under control, which suggests that further interest rate hikes are likely in the coming months,"" he added. The Australian dollar fell against the US dollar after the release of the GDP figures, as investors weighed the implications of the slowdown in growth for the RBA's interest rate policy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Motorola phone 'brazen copy' of iPhone X,"Motorola Phone Accused of Blatant iPhone X Rip-Off Motorola's latest smartphone, the Moto G8, has sparked controversy for its striking resemblance to Apple's flagship iPhone X. Critics have accused the company of blatantly copying Apple's design, raising questions about originality and innovation within the smartphone industry. The Moto G8 features a near-identical notch display, which Apple introduced with the iPhone X in 2017. This distinctive design element houses the front-facing camera and sensors, providing a more immersive viewing experience. However, Motorola's implementation on the Moto G8 appears to be a direct copy, lacking any significant differentiation. Furthermore, the overall shape and layout of the Moto G8 also bear a striking similarity to the iPhone X. The device has a sleek, rectangular body with curved edges and a glass back. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and camera module are also positioned in nearly the same locations. Critics argue that Motorola's brazen imitation is a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of Apple's design. They contend that it stifles innovation and prevents consumers from having access to truly unique smartphones. Motorola has not directly addressed the accusations, but it did release a statement emphasizing the ""competitive"" nature of the smartphone market. The company also highlighted the Moto G8's affordability as a key selling point. However, industry experts question whether Motorola's justification is sufficient. They argue that even in a crowded market, originality and differentiation are essential for long-term success. The controversy surrounding the Moto G8 highlights the complex relationship between inspiration and imitation in the tech industry. While it is natural for companies to draw inspiration from successful products, outright copying raises concerns about intellectual property rights and consumer choice. As the smartphone market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Motorola and other manufacturers will prioritize originality or seek to emulate the success of established brands. Additional Observations: The Moto G8 is significantly cheaper than the iPhone X, retailing for around £200 against the iPhone X's original price of £999. Some consumers may appreciate the more affordable option provided by the Moto G8, even if it resembles an existing design. Motorola's decision to copy Apple's design may have been a strategic move to appeal to consumers who desire the iPhone X aesthetic without paying a premium price.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
State school numbers rise at Cambridge,"State school numbers rise at Cambridge Data released by the University of Cambridge has shown that the number of students from state schools accepted into the university has increased for the eighth consecutive year. In the 2023 admissions cycle, 60.7% of UK undergraduates admitted to Cambridge were from state schools, up from 59.9% the previous year. This is the highest proportion of state school students admitted to the university since records began in 2004. The increase has been driven by a number of factors, including the university's outreach work in state schools, its contextual admissions policy, and the increasing number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to Cambridge. The university's outreach work includes a range of activities designed to encourage and support students from underrepresented backgrounds to apply to Cambridge. These activities include summer schools, masterclasses, and mentoring programs. The university's contextual admissions policy takes into account a range of factors when making admissions decisions, including a student's school type, family income, and whether they have been in care. This policy helps to ensure that students from all backgrounds have a fair chance of being admitted to Cambridge. The increasing number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to Cambridge is a reflection of the growing awareness of the university's commitment to widening access. The university has a number of initiatives in place to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including the Cambridge Bursary Scheme, which provides financial support to students from low-income families. The increase in the number of state school students admitted to Cambridge is a positive development. It shows that the university is making progress in its efforts to widen access and ensure that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to study at Cambridge. However, there is still more to be done. The university is committed to continuing its outreach work and to developing new initiatives to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. The university also believes that the government must do more to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including increasing funding for schools and universities. Only by working together can we ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed in higher education.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Criticism over lack of detail on Lake Vyrnwy estate future,"Concerns have been raised over the lack of detail provided by Severn Trent about the future of the Lake Vyrnwy estate. The water company, which owns the 24,000-acre estate in Powys, has said it is considering options for its future, including selling it. But critics say Severn Trent has been too vague about its plans and have called for more information to be made public. The Lake Vyrnwy estate is a popular tourist destination and is home to a number of businesses and organisations, including the RSPB and the National Trust. Any sale of the estate could have a significant impact on the local economy and environment. Powys County Council leader Rosemarie Harris said: ""We are concerned about the lack of detail that has been provided by Severn Trent so far. ""The estate is a major asset to Powys and we need to know what the company's plans are for its future."" Severn Trent has said it is committed to ""working closely with the local community"" to develop a plan for the estate. But critics say the company needs to be more specific about its plans. Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams said: ""Severn Trent needs to come clean about what its plans are for the estate. ""The local community deserves to know what the future holds for this important asset."" A Severn Trent spokesperson said: ""We are currently considering a number of options for the future of the Lake Vyrnwy estate. ""We are committed to working closely with the local community to develop a plan that is in the best interests of all stakeholders.""

Jersey pair in 30-year search for Iron Age coins,"In the verdant fields of Jersey, a tenacious husband-and-wife duo has embarked on a remarkable 30-year quest to uncover the secrets of their beloved island's Iron Age past. Tony and Heather Everett, both archaeology enthusiasts, have dedicated countless hours combing the landscape, meticulously searching for elusive Iron Age coins. Their unwavering determination stems from a profound passion for history and a desire to unravel the hidden stories of their ancestral home.

Britain First leader and deputy leader jailed for hate crimes,"Britain First Leader and Deputy Leader Jailed for Hate Crimes Former Britain First leader Paul Golding and deputy leader Jayda Fransen have been jailed for 16 months and two years respectively for religiously aggravated harassment. The charges stemmed from an incident in March 2018, in which the pair distributed leaflets and made abusive comments outside a mosque in Luton, Bedfordshire. Witnesses reported that Golding and Fransen shouted at Muslims and called them ""rapists"" and ""child abusers."" The convictions follow a lengthy trial at the Old Bailey, where jurors heard how the pair's actions had caused significant distress to the Muslim community in Luton. Judge Colin Durman said that the pair had ""crossed the line"" and that their comments were ""offensive, inflammatory, and intended to stir up hatred."" Golding, who previously served as a police officer, was found guilty of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Fransen, who has a history of making anti-Muslim statements, was convicted of one count of the same offense. During the trial, the defense argued that the pair were exercising their right to freedom of speech. However, the judge rejected this argument, stating that their comments had gone beyond legitimate criticism and incited hatred. Prosecuting attorney Mark Heywood described Golding and Fransen as ""dangerous"" and ""poisonous."" He said that their actions had ""caused significant harm to the Muslim community in Luton."" The convictions have been welcomed by anti-racism campaigners, who have long condemned Britain First as a far-right extremist group. Shahid Malik, the former MP for Dewsbury, called the sentences ""a victory for justice"" and said that they ""send a strong message that hate crimes will not be tolerated."" However, Britain First supporters have condemned the convictions as an ""attack on free speech."" In a statement, the group said that Golding and Fransen were ""innocent of any crime"" and that they had been ""unfairly targeted."" The convictions come at a time of growing concern about far-right extremism in the UK. In recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents of hate crimes against Muslims, including the murder of Jo Cox MP in 2016. The government has been criticized for its handling of far-right extremism, and there are calls for more to be done to tackle the problem.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Barclays reviewing currency trades,"Barclays, one of the world's largest banks, is reviewing its currency trading operations in light of recent market volatility. The bank is examining its trading strategies, risk management practices, and technology systems to ensure they are robust and effective. The review comes as currency markets have been roiled by a number of factors, including the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, and the global economic slowdown. These factors have led to increased volatility and a sharp decline in trading volumes. Barclays is not the only bank to review its currency trading operations in recent months. Other banks, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, have also taken steps to strengthen their risk management practices and improve their trading systems. The increased scrutiny of currency trading operations comes as regulators around the world are stepping up their oversight of the foreign exchange market. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of currency manipulation and other misconduct in the market. In 2014, for example, five major banks were fined a total of $4.3 billion by regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland for manipulating currency rates. The banks were found to have colluded to fix the prices of currencies, such as the euro and the yen, in order to profit from their trading. The increased regulatory scrutiny and the recent market volatility have led to a number of changes in the way that banks trade currencies. Banks are now required to hold more capital against their currency trading operations and to have more robust risk management systems in place. They are also under pressure to improve their trading technology and to be more transparent about their trading activities. These changes are likely to make it more difficult for banks to profit from currency trading in the future. Despite the challenges, currency trading remains an important part of the global financial system. Currencies are used to facilitate trade and investment, and they play a key role in the global economy. Banks will need to continue to adapt their currency trading operations to meet the challenges of the changing regulatory environment and the evolving market landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Many theatres are now struggling to survive and are facing an uncertain future. The Lyric Theatre is a vital part of the Belfast arts scene and its closure will be a major loss to the city. However, the theatre's decision to put safety first is understandable and it is hoped that it will be able to reopen in 2021 with a full and vibrant programme of events.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Views sought on Gatwick and London 'airspace motorway',"Views sought on Gatwick and London 'airspace motorway' A public consultation has been launched on plans to create an 'airspace motorway' linking Gatwick and London's Heathrow airports. The proposals, from air traffic control company NATS, would see a dedicated route for aircraft flying between the two airports, in a bid to reduce delays and carbon emissions. The consultation will run until 29 October and will seek views from the public, airlines, and other stakeholders. NATS says the airspace motorway would ""revolutionise"" air travel in the south-east of England, and would ""deliver significant benefits"" for passengers, airlines, and the environment. The company claims that the motorway would reduce delays by up to 20 minutes per flight, and would cut carbon emissions by up to 10%. It would also free up airspace for other flights, allowing for more capacity and flexibility. However, some environmental groups have expressed concerns about the plans, arguing that they could lead to increased noise pollution for communities living near the flight paths. The consultation will seek to address these concerns, and NATS says it is committed to working with local communities to mitigate any potential impacts. If the plans are approved, the airspace motorway could be in operation by 2029. Key benefits of the airspace motorway: Reduced delays for passengers Lower carbon emissions Increased capacity and flexibility Improved air quality Potential concerns: Increased noise pollution for communities near flight paths Visual impact of aircraft flying overhead How to have your say: The public consultation on the airspace motorway is open until 29 October.

RHI scandal: Boiler owners opposed to being publicly named,"RHI scandal: Boiler owners opposed to being publicly named A number of boiler owners have expressed their opposition to being publicly named as part of the ongoing public inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal. The RHI scheme, which was introduced in Northern Ireland in 2012, was designed to encourage the uptake of renewable energy technologies by providing financial incentives to businesses and individuals who installed biomass boilers. However, the scheme was found to have been poorly designed and implemented, leading to widespread abuse and overpayments. As a result, the Northern Ireland Executive has been ordered to pay back more than £500 million to the UK Treasury. The public inquiry into the RHI scandal is currently underway, and part of its remit is to identify those who benefited financially from the scheme. However, a number of boiler owners have objected to their names being made public, arguing that it would damage their privacy and reputation. In a letter to the inquiry, one boiler owner said that he had ""done nothing wrong"" and that his name should not be ""dragged through the mud"" for simply participating in a government scheme. Another boiler owner said that she was ""afraid of being targeted by vigilantes"" if her name was made public. The inquiry panel has said that it is ""sympathetic"" to the concerns of boiler owners, but that it is important to ensure that the public has a full understanding of the RHI scandal. ""We believe that it is in the public interest for the names of those who benefited financially from the scheme to be made public,"" the panel said. ""However, we will consider the privacy concerns of individual boiler owners on a case-by-case basis."" The inquiry panel has also said that it will not name any boiler owners who have repaid the overpayments they received under the scheme. The RHI scandal has had a significant impact on Northern Ireland, both financially and politically. The public inquiry is expected to last for several months, and it is likely that further revelations about the scandal will emerge.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Japan ninja student gets top marks for writing essay in invisible ink,"In an extraordinary feat of stealth and academic prowess, a ninja student in Japan has astounded educators by receiving top marks for writing an essay in invisible ink. The student, whose identity remains a closely guarded secret, attends the prestigious Ninja Academy in Iga, Mie Prefecture. The academy is renowned for its rigorous training program, which prepares students for a life of espionage and covert operations. According to academy officials, the student's essay was a masterpiece of subterfuge. It was written entirely in an invisible ink made from a secret blend of natural ingredients, including lemon juice and vinegar. To reveal the hidden text, the examiner had to use a special chemical solution, which caused the ink to become visible. The essay itself was a scholarly investigation into the history and techniques of ninja warfare. The student demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject, showcasing their mastery of both ancient and modern ninja arts. The examiner was particularly impressed by the student's analysis of the use of invisible ink in ninja operations throughout history. ""This essay is an exceptional example of the skills and knowledge that our students develop at the Ninja Academy,"" said a spokesperson for the academy. ""To achieve such a high level of mastery in both writing and stealth is a testament to the student's dedication and hard work."" The student's achievement has sparked a renewed interest in the ancient art of invisible ink. Historians and scholars are now exploring the potential applications of this technology in modern espionage and counterintelligence. Some experts believe that invisible ink could play a significant role in future conflicts, allowing agents to communicate securely and leave behind undetectable messages. Others argue that the technology is outdated and easily detectable by modern surveillance techniques. Regardless of its potential military applications, the student's achievement serves as a reminder of the enduring power of stealth and the importance of mastering the art of deception. As the world becomes increasingly digital and transparent, the ability to hide in plain sight will become an invaluable asset for those seeking to achieve their goals, whether they be political, military, or personal.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pacific castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga's health worsens,"The health of Pacific castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga has worsened since his return to El Salvador, according to his family. Alvarenga, 37, spent more than 13 months adrift in the Pacific Ocean after his fishing boat capsized in 2012. He was rescued in January 2014 and returned to El Salvador, where he received medical treatment. However, his family says that his health has deteriorated in recent months. He has lost weight, is suffering from muscle pain, and has difficulty sleeping. Alvarenga's family has taken him to several doctors, but they have been unable to diagnose his condition. They are now appealing for help from the government and international medical experts. ""We don't know what's wrong with him,"" said Alvarenga's mother, Maria Julia Alvarenga. ""He's in a lot of pain and we don't know how to help him."" Alvarenga's ordeal began in December 2012, when his fishing boat capsized off the coast of Mexico. He was stranded at sea with a 15-year-old boy, who died after a few weeks. Alvarenga survived by eating fish, turtles, and birds. He also drank his own urine and seawater. He was finally rescued by a cargo ship in January 2014, after drifting more than 6,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. Upon his return to El Salvador, Alvarenga was hailed as a hero. He was given a ticker-tape parade and met with President Salvador Sanchez Ceren. However, Alvarenga's health has since declined. He has been suffering from muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. He has also lost a significant amount of weight. Alvarenga's family is worried that his health problems may be related to his time at sea. They are hoping that doctors will be able to diagnose his condition and provide him with treatment. ""We just want him to get better,"" said Alvarenga's mother.

London Bridge terrorist-hiring head teacher struck off,"London Bridge terrorist-hiring head teacher struck off A head teacher who hired an assistant later convicted of plotting the London Bridge terror attack has been struck off the teaching register. Suzette Lampkin was the head of the Westminster Academy when she hired Nicky Reilly. Reilly had previously worked at several other schools and had been investigated for inappropriate behaviour. In 2017, Reilly was jailed for life for helping plan the attack in which eight people were killed and 48 injured. Lampkin was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct by a National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) panel. The panel heard that Lampkin had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the suitability of Reilly before hiring him. It also found that she had failed to follow up on concerns raised by staff about Reilly's behaviour. Lampkin has been prohibited from teaching indefinitely. The NCTL said in a statement: ""The panel found that Mrs Lampkin's actions fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession. ""The panel was particularly concerned that Mrs Lampkin had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the suitability of Mr Reilly before appointing him, and that she had failed to follow up on concerns raised by staff about his behaviour. ""The panel considered that Mrs Lampkin's actions had the potential to put children at risk of harm, and that she had shown a disregard for the welfare of her pupils."" Westminster Academy is a secondary school in the London Borough of Westminster. It is a co-educational academy with a sixth form. The school was rated ""good"" by Ofsted in its most recent inspection in 2019. Lampkin has the right to appeal the NCTL's decision.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Miss Wales pageant entry rules 'not fit for 21st Century',"Miss Wales Pageant Entry Rules 'Not Fit for 21st Century' The Miss Wales pageant has come under fire for its strict entry rules, which critics say are outdated and discriminatory. One of the most controversial rules is the requirement that contestants be aged between 17 and 24. This rule has been criticized as being ageist and excluding older women from participating. Another rule that has been criticized is the requirement that contestants be unmarried and have no children. This rule has been criticized as being sexist and discriminatory against women who are mothers or who have been married. In addition, the pageant has been criticized for its focus on physical appearance. Contestants are judged on their beauty, figure, and poise, which critics say perpetuates unrealistic and harmful stereotypes about women. The Miss Wales pageant is not the only pageant to face criticism for its outdated rules. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to challenge the traditional beauty standards and practices that are associated with pageants. Critics argue that pageants promote a narrow and unattainable ideal of beauty that can lead to body image issues and eating disorders. They also argue that pageants perpetuate sexist stereotypes and objectify women. In response to the criticism, some pageants have begun to change their rules and practices. For example, the Miss Universe pageant recently eliminated the swimsuit competition and now focuses on empowering women and promoting social change. The Miss Wales pageant has not yet made any changes to its rules, but it is facing pressure from critics to do so. A petition has been launched calling on the pageant to update its rules and make them more inclusive. The petition has already gathered over 10,000 signatures, and it is clear that there is a growing demand for change. It remains to be seen whether the Miss Wales pageant will listen to the criticism and make the necessary changes. If the pageant does not change its rules, it is likely to face continued criticism and may even lose its relevance in the 21st century.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Wylfa: Last day for Anglesey nuclear plant,"The last day of operations for the Wylfa nuclear power plant on the Isle of Anglesey has arrived, marking the end of an era for the island and the UK's nuclear industry. For over 40 years, Wylfa has been a major employer and a significant contributor to the UK's energy supply, generating enough electricity to power millions of homes across the country. As the sun sets on Wylfa's final day, a palpable sense of nostalgia hangs in the air. Former employees, local residents, and energy experts gather to bid farewell to the iconic plant. The mood is bittersweet, as people reflect on the plant's history and its role in shaping the region. Commissioned in 1971, Wylfa was one of the first nuclear power plants built in the UK. It has operated safely and reliably throughout its lifetime, providing a steady and low-carbon source of energy. However, the plant has also faced its share of challenges, including a major fire in 1982 and a series of safety concerns in recent years. Despite these challenges, Wylfa has remained a vital part of the UK's energy mix. It has employed thousands of people over the years, providing jobs and economic benefits to the local community. The plant has also played a key role in reducing the UK's reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. As Wylfa enters its final hours, the focus shifts to the future. The UK government has pledged to invest in new nuclear power stations, recognizing the importance of this technology in meeting the country's future energy needs. However, the debate over nuclear power continues, with some arguing that it is too expensive and risky, while others maintain that it is essential for a secure and low-carbon energy future. The closure of Wylfa marks a significant milestone in the UK's energy history. It is a reminder of the complex challenges and opportunities that come with nuclear power and the importance of balancing the need for reliable energy with environmental and safety concerns. As the last reactor at Wylfa is shut down, a new chapter begins for the Isle of Anglesey and the UK's nuclear industry. The future of nuclear power in the UK remains uncertain, but the legacy of Wylfa will undoubtedly continue to shape the debate for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The Central Council of Jews in Germany said there had been 10 anti-Semitic attacks in the Berlin area in recent weeks, including several in which people wearing kippahs were assaulted or verbally abused. ""We are deeply concerned about the recent attacks on Jews in Berlin,"" said Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. ""We urge the German authorities to take immediate action to protect Jews and their religious symbols."" The German government has condemned the attacks and pledged to take action to protect Jews. ""These attacks are unacceptable and will not be tolerated,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We will do everything in our power to protect our Jewish citizens and ensure that they can live safely in Germany."" The German police have increased their presence in areas where Jews are known to live and have set up special patrols to protect synagogues and Jewish schools. However, the Central Council of Jews in Germany said that more needs to be done to protect Jews from anti-Semitic attacks. ""We need more police protection and more education about anti-Semitism,"" said Schuster. ""We also need to speak out against anti-Semitism whenever and wherever we see it."" The attacks on Jews in Berlin have raised concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany. A recent study by the University of Bielefeld found that anti-Semitic attitudes are on the rise in Germany, with 20% of Germans saying that they hold anti-Semitic views. The study also found that anti-Semitism is more common among people who are young, male, and poorly educated. The German government has said that it is committed to fighting anti-Semitism and has pledged to take action to reduce anti-Semitic attitudes in Germany. However, the Central Council of Jews in Germany said that the government needs to do more to address the root causes of anti-Semitism.

Saida Mirziyoyeva, 39, is a pop star and businesswoman who has become increasingly visible in public life in recent years. She is a member of parliament and the head of the country's largest charity, the Zulfiya Foundation. Some observers believe that Saida Mirziyoyeva is being groomed to succeed her father as president. She has been given a prominent role in the government and has been praised by state media. However, there are also signs that Saida Mirziyoyeva is facing resistance from within the ruling elite. In recent months, several of her close associates have been arrested on corruption charges. It is unclear whether these arrests are part of a wider power struggle or simply an attempt by the president to consolidate his power. However, they have raised concerns about the stability of Uzbekistan's political system. Uzbekistan is a key player in Central Asia and has been seen as a potential bridge between Russia and the West. However, the country's political future is now uncertain.

Police have confirmed that three dogs were involved in the attack and that they gained access to the garden through a hole in the fence. The victim has been named locally as Betty Moore. She was a much-loved member of the community and her death has come as a great shock. Tributes have been paid to Mrs. Moore, who was described as a ""kind and gentle soul"" who will be deeply missed. The dogs involved in the attack have been seized by police and are currently being held in kennels. It is understood that the dogs are all of a large breed, but their exact breed has not yet been confirmed. Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses to come forward. In the wake of the tragedy, there have been calls for stricter laws on dog ownership. Some people believe that dangerous breeds of dogs should be banned altogether. Others argue that it is the owners who are responsible for their dogs' behavior and that it is up to them to ensure that their pets are properly trained and controlled. The debate over dog ownership is likely to continue in the wake of this tragic incident. However, one thing is for sure: the death of Betty Moore serves as a reminder that even the most well-behaved dogs can be capable of inflicting serious harm.

eBay antique dealer faked signatures of public figures,"An eBay antique dealer who faked signatures of public figures, including Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, has been jailed for four years. David Lassman, 71, from north London, admitted forging signatures on books, photographs and letters over a seven-year period. He sold them to unsuspecting buyers on eBay, making a profit of more than £100,000. Isleworth Crown Court heard how Lassman used a variety of techniques to create the fake signatures, including tracing over original signatures and using a computer to generate them. He was caught after a customer became suspicious of a signed photograph of Churchill and reported it to the police.

In court, Lassman pleaded guilty to 10 counts of fraud and one count of possession of articles for use in fraud. He was sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay £100,000 in compensation to his victims. Judge Martin Edmunds said: ""You have committed a serious breach of trust. You have sold these items to unsuspecting buyers who believed they were genuine. ""You have made a significant profit from your dishonesty and you have caused your victims a great deal of distress."" Lassman's actions have had a damaging impact on the antiques market. It is now more difficult for buyers to be sure that the items they are purchasing are genuine.

Scottish food and drink export sales 'on target',"Scottish Food and Drink Export Sales on Target The Scottish food and drink sector is on track to meet its ambitious export target of £1 billion in 2023, according to the latest industry data from Scotland Food & Drink. Exports of Scottish food and drink increased by 12.2% in the first half of the year, reaching £501 million. This growth was driven by strong demand for Scotch whisky, seafood, and other high-quality products. The United States remains the largest export market for Scottish food and drink, accounting for 27% of sales. However, there has been significant growth in other markets, including China, France, and Germany. The Scottish Government has welcomed the news and highlighted the importance of the food and drink sector to the country's economy. Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: ""I am delighted to see that our food and drink sector is performing so well internationally. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our producers and exporters.""

Global spam e-mail drops after hacker arrests,"Global Spam E-mail Drops After Hacker Arrests A concerted global crackdown on spam email has yielded significant results, with a 75% decline in spam messages since the arrests of two prolific hackers. The joint operation, led by the United States, United Kingdom, and Europol, targeted two criminal groups responsible for distributing a vast majority of spam worldwide. The arrests have disrupted their networks and significantly reduced the flow of unsolicited emails. ""This operation has been a major blow to the global spam industry,"" said Robert Anderson, a spokesperson for the FBI. ""These criminal groups were responsible for billions of spam emails every day, which not only disrupted people's inboxes but also spread malware and online scams."" Before the arrests, spam emails accounted for over half of all email traffic. They flooded inboxes with unwanted messages, often containing malicious links or fraudulent offers. The decline in spam since the crackdown has been a welcome relief for internet users worldwide. ""I used to get dozens of spam emails a day,"" said Sarah Jones, a London resident. ""It was a constant annoyance, and I had to spend a lot of time manually filtering them out of my inbox. Now, I hardly get any spam at all."" The operation involved a coordinated effort by law enforcement and technology companies. Investigators tracked the hackers' activities across multiple countries and seized their databases and equipment. The arrests were the culmination of a months-long investigation that required close collaboration between local and international agencies. ""This is a significant milestone in the fight against cybercrime,"" said Europol's Wil van Gemert. ""It demonstrates that law enforcement and the tech industry can work together to protect the public from online threats."" While the decline in spam is a positive development, experts warn that the threats may evolve over time. Hackers are constantly adapting their techniques, and it is important for users to remain vigilant and protect themselves from unsolicited emails. Security experts recommend using spam filters, being cautious when clicking on links, and not responding to suspicious emails. Users should also avoid sharing personal information online and regularly update their security software. By following these precautions, internet users can help protect themselves from spam and other online threats while enjoying the benefits of a cleaner and safer digital environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Diamond Jubilee: How did London's transport system cope?,"London's transport system underwent rigorous preparations for the Diamond Jubilee, ensuring seamless movement for the colossal crowds that descended upon the capital to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne. The vast network of Underground lines, buses, and trains operated at heightened capacity, with additional services and extended hours implemented to accommodate the expected influx of revelers. Extra staff were deployed at key stations and interchanges, providing guidance and support to passengers. One of the most significant challenges was managing the colossal crowds expected for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, a spectacular flotilla of over 1,000 boats sailing down the River Thames. To facilitate smooth access to the waterfront, additional river services were introduced, including special ""Jubilee River Buses"" connecting key locations along the route. Furthermore, dedicated ""Jubilee Lanes"" were established at major transport hubs, such as Victoria and Waterloo stations, guiding visitors towards designated viewing areas along the Thames. These lanes provided a safe and organized flow of people, minimizing congestion and enhancing the overall experience for spectators. Behind the scenes, meticulous planning and coordination ensured the efficient deployment of resources. The London Transport Operations Centre (LTOC) acted as the nerve center, monitoring the system in real-time and responding swiftly to any disruptions or emergencies. Advanced technology, including CCTV cameras and passenger information displays, played a crucial role in maintaining smooth operations and providing up-to-date travel information to commuters. The success of London's transport system on this momentous occasion was a testament to the meticulous planning, hard work, and collaboration of countless individuals.

Dale Farm eviction: Residents prepare for confrontation,"Dale Farm residents prepare for confrontation with bailiffs as eviction looms Tensions are high at Dale Farm as residents prepare for a confrontation with bailiffs who are due to arrive on Wednesday to evict them from their homes. The 400-strong community of Dale Farm, near Basildon, Essex, has been given until Wednesday to leave the site, which they have occupied illegally for more than a decade. But residents say they will not go without a fight and have vowed to resist eviction. ""We are not going to give up our homes without a fight,"" said Mary Flynn, a Dale Farm resident. ""We have been here for over 10 years and we have nowhere else to go."" The eviction is the culmination of a long-running legal battle between the residents and Basildon Council, which owns the land. The council has argued that the Dale Farm site is illegal and that the residents are trespassing. But the residents say they have a right to live on the land and that they have been unfairly treated by the council. ""We have been treated like second-class citizens,"" said Patrick Flynn, another Dale Farm resident. ""The council has made it clear that they don't want us here."" The eviction is likely to be a major challenge for the police, who will be responsible for enforcing the court order. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Worron said the police would be ""professional and proportionate"" in their approach. ""We will be working to ensure that the eviction is carried out safely and peacefully,"" he said. However, the residents have said they will not cooperate with the police and will do everything they can to prevent the eviction. ""We are not going to make it easy for them,"" said Mary Flynn. ""We are going to fight them every step of the way."" The eviction is expected to begin at 8am on Wednesday. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes for the BBC writer The BBC is committed to impartiality and accuracy in its reporting.

Popcorn Time's app is seen by Netflix as a threat - here's how,"Popcorn Time, the popular streaming app that allows users to watch movies and TV shows for free, is seen by Netflix as a major threat. The app, which has been downloaded millions of times, has been accused of copyright infringement and piracy by the film and television industry. Netflix has been investing heavily in original content in recent years, and the company is concerned that Popcorn Time is eroding its subscriber base. In a recent interview, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that Popcorn Time is ""a threat to our business"" and that the company is ""doing everything we can to fight it."" So far, Netflix has been unable to stop the spread of Popcorn Time. The app is available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. It is also easy to download and install, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Netflix has tried to combat Popcorn Time by launching its own streaming service in several countries around the world. The company has also been working with internet service providers to block access to the app. However, these efforts have had limited success so far. Popcorn Time is just one of a number of streaming apps that are challenging Netflix's dominance in the market. Other apps, such as Kodi and Stremio, also allow users to watch movies and TV shows for free. The rise of streaming apps is a major challenge for Netflix. The company is facing increasing competition from a number of different sources, and it is clear that it will need to find new ways to attract and retain subscribers. One way that Netflix could combat the threat from Popcorn Time and other streaming apps is to offer a more affordable subscription service. The company has already introduced a number of different subscription plans, but it could go even further by offering a lower-priced plan that is designed to appeal to budget-minded consumers. Netflix could also try to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering a wider variety of content. The company has already invested heavily in original programming, but it could go even further by acquiring the rights to more popular movies and TV shows. Ultimately, Netflix's success will depend on its ability to offer a compelling value proposition to its subscribers. The company will need to find ways to differentiate itself from its competitors and offer a service that is worth paying for.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

D-Day veteran Gordon Prime lands Legion d'Honneur in France,"In a poignant ceremony imbued with gratitude and remembrance, D-Day veteran Gordon Prime has been awarded the prestigious Legion d'Honneur in France, the country he helped liberate during World War II. At the age of 97, Mr. Prime traveled to Ouistreham, Normandy, where he landed on Sword Beach as a Royal Engineer on June 6, 1944. His unit's task was to clear obstacles and mines from the beach, paving the way for Allied troops. ""It was a frightening experience,"" Mr. Prime recalled. ""But we knew what we had to do, and we did it."" The Legion d'Honneur, France's highest decoration, is bestowed upon individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the country. Mr. Prime's service on D-Day, which marked a turning point in the war, undoubtedly merited this honor. ""It's an incredible privilege to receive this award,"" said Mr. Prime. ""It brings back so many memories, both good and bad."" The French consul in Portsmouth, Mr. Pierre-Emmanuel Quirin, presented the award to Mr. Prime. ""We are eternally grateful for the sacrifices made by veterans like Mr. Prime,"" he said. ""Their bravery and determination helped secure our freedom."" Mr. Prime's landing on Sword Beach was part of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. Over 150,000 troops stormed the beaches, facing fierce resistance from German forces. The operation was a costly but ultimately successful endeavor, and it marked the beginning of the liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation. Mr. Prime's experiences on D-Day have stayed with him throughout his life. ""I never forgot the faces of the men I fought alongside,"" he said. ""They were the bravest people I ever met.""

Apple 'optimistic' about post-Brexit UK,"Despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the European Union, Apple remains optimistic about its future in the country. In a recent interview, Apple's CEO Tim Cook expressed confidence in the UK's ability to thrive post-Brexit, highlighting the country's strong economy, talented workforce, and vibrant tech sector. Cook's optimism is echoed by other industry leaders. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai has also praised the UK's tech ecosystem, calling it ""one of the most dynamic and innovative in the world."" And Amazon has recently announced plans to create 1,000 new jobs in the UK, a sign of its commitment to the country. There are several reasons for Apple's optimism. First, the UK has a strong economy, with a GDP of over $2.7 trillion. This makes it one of the largest economies in the world, and provides a significant market for Apple's products and services. Second, the UK has a highly skilled workforce. The country's universities produce some of the best graduates in the world, and it has a large pool of experienced professionals in the tech sector. This makes it an attractive location for businesses looking to hire top talent. Third, the UK has a vibrant tech sector. The country is home to some of the world's leading tech companies, including ARM, Vodafone, and BT. This creates a supportive ecosystem for businesses looking to grow and innovate. Of course, there are some challenges that Apple and other businesses will face in the UK post-Brexit. One challenge is the potential for tariffs on goods imported into the UK from the EU. This could increase the cost of Apple's products for UK consumers. Another challenge is the potential for changes to data protection laws in the UK. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most stringent data protection laws in the world, and it provides strong protection for consumers' personal data. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it is possible that the GDPR will no longer apply in the UK. This could create uncertainty for businesses and consumers alike. Despite these challenges, Apple remains committed to the UK. The company has a long history in the country, and it employs over 6,000 people in the UK. Apple is also investing heavily in the UK, with plans to build a new campus in London. Apple's optimism about the UK post-Brexit is a positive sign for the country's tech sector. It shows that global tech companies are confident in the UK's ability to thrive outside of the EU. This confidence is likely to attract further investment and create jobs in the UK tech sector.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Headline Numbers: Is UK inequality as bad as in the US?,"Headline Numbers: Is UK Inequality as Bad as in the US? Income inequality in the United Kingdom and the United States has been a subject of much debate in recent years. While both countries have seen a widening wealth gap, the extent to which it is worse in the US has been a matter of contention. Comparisons of Income Inequality Gini coefficient: The Gini coefficient measures the distribution of income in a society, with a higher coefficient indicating greater inequality. In the US, the Gini coefficient has risen from 0.42 in 1979 to 0.47 in 2019, while in the UK it has increased from 0.32 in 1990 to 0.36 in 2019. This suggests that inequality has increased faster in the US. Top 1%: The share of income earned by the top 1% of earners has also increased more in the US than in the UK. In the US, the top 1% captured 10% of total income in 1979, rising to 20% in 2019. In the UK, the top 1% earned 7% of income in 1990, reaching 14% in 2019. Median income: However, a key difference lies in the median income levels of the two countries. The median US household income was $63,179 in 2019, significantly higher than the UK median income of £29,900 ($40,500). This suggests that while inequality may be more pronounced in the US, the overall standard of living for average households is higher. Causes of Inequality The causes of inequality are complex and multifaceted, but some key factors include: Technological change: Automation and technological advances have led to a decline in jobs requiring lower-skill workers, exacerbating income disparities. Globalization: Offshoring and outsourcing have shifted job opportunities abroad, further contributing to inequality. Education gaps: Growing disparities in educational attainment between different socioeconomic groups can lead to unequal access to well-paying jobs. Tax policies: Tax policies that favor high-income earners can contribute to rising inequality. Addressing Inequality Tackling income inequality requires a comprehensive approach that includes: Investing in education and skills training: Enhancing access to quality education can help close socioeconomic gaps and prepare individuals for the jobs of the future. Strengthening social safety nets: Social programs such as minimum wage increases, tax credits, and universal basic income can provide support to low-income households. Reforming tax policies: Progressive tax policies that shift the tax burden towards high-income earners can reduce inequality. Promoting labor market regulation: Measures such as collective bargaining rights and minimum wage enforcement can help ensure fair wages for workers. Conclusion While the headline numbers suggest that income inequality has risen in both the UK and the US, the extent of the problem varies. The US has experienced a more significant widening of the wealth gap compared to the UK. However, the UK faces its own challenges in addressing inequality, particularly in terms of socioeconomic disparities and the rising cost of living. Tackling these issues requires a concerted effort from governments, businesses, and society as a whole to create a more just and equitable economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Addressing a gathering of religious leaders in Abu Dhabi, the Pope emphasized the shared values of love, mercy, and respect that bind the two faiths together. He urged followers of both religions to reject violence and extremism, and to work collectively for a just and peaceful world. ""Christians and Muslims are brothers and sisters in the same human family, and as such, we should live together in harmony and mutual respect,"" the Pope said.

The Pope's message of brotherhood and unity resonated with religious leaders from both sides. Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Cairo's Al-Azhar Mosque, hailed the Pope's speech as a ""new chapter"" in interfaith relations. ""We are all children of God,"" Imam el-Tayeb said.

UN body bars Sri Lanka diplomat Maj Gen Shavendra Silva,"A United Nations body has barred a Sri Lankan diplomat from participating in its sessions because of his alleged involvement in war crimes. Maj Gen Shavendra Silva was Sri Lanka's army chief during the final stages of the country's 26-year civil war, which ended in 2009. He and other military personnel have been accused of committing atrocities against Tamil civilians during the conflict. In 2021, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) passed a resolution calling for an international investigation into alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka. The resolution also called for the government to take steps to prevent further violations and to hold those responsible to account. Silva's appointment as Sri Lanka's deputy permanent representative to the UN in New York has been widely condemned by human rights groups. They argue that it sends the wrong message and undermines the UN's efforts to promote accountability for war crimes. The UNHRC has now decided to bar Silva from attending its sessions. The body's spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said that the decision had been made ""in light of the serious allegations of human rights violations against him"". Colville said that the UNHRC was ""deeply concerned"" by Silva's appointment and that it had ""repeatedly called on the government of Sri Lanka to investigate these allegations and to hold those responsible to account"". He said that the UNHRC's decision to bar Silva from its sessions was ""a clear message that we will not tolerate impunity for war crimes"". The Sri Lankan government has defended Silva's appointment, saying that he is a ""respected military officer"" who has been unfairly targeted by human rights groups. However, the international community has been increasingly critical of Sri Lanka's human rights record. In addition to the UNHRC resolution, the European Union has also passed a resolution calling for an international investigation into alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka.

Coronavirus: New 'fast and accurate' antibody test developed,"## Coronavirus: New 'fast and accurate' antibody test developed Scientists have developed a new antibody test for coronavirus that is fast, accurate, and easy to use, and could be used in doctors' surgeries or at home. The test, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, can detect antibodies against the virus in just 10 minutes, using a drop of blood from a finger prick. This is much faster than current antibody tests, which can take several hours or even days to produce results. The new test is also highly accurate, with a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 100%. This means that it is very good at detecting antibodies against the virus, and very good at not giving false positive results. The test is also easy to use, and can be performed by anyone with minimal training. This means that it could be used in doctors' surgeries, pharmacies, or even at home. The researchers say that the new test could be a valuable tool for diagnosing coronavirus infection, and for tracking the spread of the virus. ""This test is a significant advance in the fight against coronavirus,"" said Professor Miles Carroll, one of the researchers who developed the test. ""It is fast, accurate, and easy to use, and it could be used to diagnose infection and track the spread of the virus."" ""The test could also be used to identify people who have had the virus and developed antibodies against it,"" said Professor Carroll. ""This information could be used to develop a vaccine for the virus."" The new test is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, and the researchers hope to make it available for use in the coming months. ## How does the test work? The test works by detecting antibodies against the virus in a drop of blood. Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to infection. When the body is infected with a virus, the immune system produces antibodies that are specific to that virus. These antibodies can then bind to the virus and neutralize it. The new test uses a small chip that is coated with a protein that is specific to the coronavirus. When a drop of blood is placed on the chip, the antibodies in the blood will bind to the protein. This binding event can then be detected by a reader, which produces a result in just 10 minutes. ## What are the benefits of the new test? The new test has several benefits over current antibody tests: It is fast, with results available in just 10 minutes. It is accurate, with a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 100%. It is easy to use, and can be performed by anyone with minimal training. It can be used in a variety of settings, including doctors' surgeries, pharmacies, and at home. The new test could be a valuable tool for diagnosing coronavirus infection, tracking the spread of the virus, and developing a vaccine.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

President Widodo has called for calm and has urged protesters to respect the election results. ""I urge the public to remain calm and not be provoked by any party that wants to create chaos,"" Widodo said in a televised address. ""We must protect our democracy and uphold the rule of law."" Subianto has not yet conceded defeat but has called for his supporters to refrain from violence. However, he has continued to allege irregularities in the election process. ""We will continue to fight to defend the people's votes,"" Subianto said. ""We will not give up until the truth is revealed."" The protests are a reminder of Indonesia's troubled history with elections. In 1998, widespread protests led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in power. International observers have expressed concern over the violence in Jakarta and have called on both sides to resolve their differences peacefully. ""We urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid further violence,"" a statement from the European Union said.

"Coronavirus: New mortgage holiday should affect credit record, says Nationwide boss","Coronavirus: New mortgage holiday should affect credit record, says Nationwide boss The boss of Nationwide has said he believes the new mortgage holiday introduced by the government should affect people's credit records. Joe Garner said that while the holiday was ""the right thing to do"", it was important to ensure that people did not take advantage of the situation. ""We need to make sure that people who are genuinely struggling are able to get the help they need,"" he said. ""But we also need to make sure that people who can afford to pay their mortgage don't take advantage of the situation."" Under the new scheme, borrowers will be able to apply for a three-month mortgage holiday, which will be automatically approved by lenders. The government has said that this will not affect people's credit records. However, Garner said that he believes this is a mistake. ""I think it's important that people understand that taking a mortgage holiday is a serious decision,"" he said. ""It's not something that people should do lightly."" He added that he was concerned that some people might take advantage of the holiday to stop paying their mortgage, even if they could afford to do so. ""This could have a negative impact on their credit record and make it more difficult for them to get credit in the future,"" he said. Garner's comments come as the government is facing pressure to extend the mortgage holiday scheme. The current scheme is due to end on 31 October, but some campaigners are calling for it to be extended for a further six months. The government has said that it will keep the situation under review, but has not yet made a decision on whether to extend the scheme. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has also said that it believes the mortgage holiday should affect people's credit records. ""We believe that it is important to ensure that people who take advantage of the mortgage holiday are not disadvantaged in the future,"" the CML said in a statement. The CML said that it was working with lenders to develop a system that would allow them to track borrowers who had taken a mortgage holiday. This information would then be shared with credit reference agencies. The CML said that it believed this system would help to ensure that people who took advantage of the mortgage holiday did not have their credit records unfairly affected.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Miss Iraq and Miss Israel reunited after selfie controversy,"In a remarkable turn of events, Miss Iraq, Sarah Idan, and Miss Israel, Adar Gandelsman, have reunited after a controversial selfie taken at the Miss Universe pageant in Las Vegas last month caused international outcry. The photograph, which showed Idan and Gandelsman smiling together, sparked widespread backlash in Iraq, with Idan facing accusations of treason and calls for her to be stripped of her title. Gandelsman, too, faced criticism in Israel, where some questioned her decision to pose with a representative of a country that does not recognize Israel. Despite the controversy, both women have maintained that their selfie was a message of peace and unity. In a joint statement released this week, they said they ""wanted to use our platform to show that even in the midst of conflict, people can come together."" ""We believe that beauty should be a force for good in the world, and we hope that our photo will inspire others to see beyond borders and build bridges of understanding,"" they added. Idan and Gandelsman's reunion took place on Saturday at a private event in New York City. The two women embraced warmly and posed for photographs, sending a clear message that they remain committed to their message of peace. The controversy over the selfie has sparked a wider debate about the role of politics in beauty pageants. Some have argued that pageants should be a celebration of women's empowerment and diversity, while others believe that they should also be used to promote important social and political causes. Idan and Gandelsman's reunion is a reminder that even in the face of adversity, people can come together to promote peace and understanding. Their message is one that should be celebrated and amplified by all who believe in the power of human connection. ""I am proud of what we did,"" Idan said in an interview with the BBC.

"Committee roles for Davies, Davies, Davies (and Davies)","Committee roles for Davies, Davies, Davies (and Davies) In a rare coincidence, four MPs with the same surname have been appointed to key committee roles in the House of Commons. David TC Davies, Glyn Davies, and Mims Davies have all been made chairs of select committees, while David Davies has been appointed as a member of the powerful Intelligence and Security Committee. The Davies quartet are all members of the Conservative Party, and their appointments have been welcomed by party whips as a sign of the party's strength in depth. However, some critics have questioned whether having so many MPs with the same surname in such senior positions is a good thing for parliamentary scrutiny. ""It's a bit of a joke, really,"" said one opposition MP. ""How are we supposed to take these committees seriously when they're all run by people with the same name?"" Another critic said: ""It's not a good look for Parliament. It makes it look like the Conservative Party is just a bunch of clones."" The Davies quartet have defended their appointments, saying that they are all highly qualified for their roles and that their shared surname is irrelevant. ""I'm proud of my name, and I'm proud to serve on this committee,"" said David TC Davies, the new chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee. ""I'm confident that I can make a positive contribution to the work of this committee."" Glyn Davies, the new chair of the Justice Committee, said: ""I'm honored to have been appointed to this role.

The appointments of the Davies quartet come at a time when Parliament is facing increasing scrutiny over its effectiveness.

The Davies quartet are all experienced politicians, but they also have a range of other experience. David TC Davies is a former farmer and businessman, Glyn Davies is a former lawyer, Mims Davies is a former teacher, and David Davies is a former diplomat.

Russell Bishop trial: Jurors hear how bodies were found,"In the ongoing Russell Bishop trial, jurors were presented with chilling details of the discovery of the bodies of Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows, the two young girls who were murdered in Brighton in 1986. Detective Constable Julian Oakes, a member of the team that responded to the scene, described how he found the girls' bodies in Wild Park, a secluded woodland area. He recalled that Karen's body was submerged in a stream, while Nicola's body was lying nearby on the bank. DC Oakes said that Karen's body had multiple stab wounds, including a fatal wound to the heart. Nicola's body had also been stabbed numerous times, and she had also suffered a head injury. The court heard that a forensic pathologist, Dr. Derek James, determined that both girls had died from ""penetrating chest injuries caused by a sharp instrument."" He testified that the injuries were consistent with those caused by a knife. Dr. James also noted that Karen's body had traces of semen, which suggested that she had been sexually assaulted. However, he said that there was no evidence of sexual assault on Nicola's body. The prosecution alleges that Bishop, who is now 54, killed the girls after sexually assaulting them. Bishop has denied both charges of murder and two charges of indecent assault. During cross-examination, Bishop's defense lawyer, Joel Bennathan QC, suggested that someone else could have killed the girls. He pointed out that there were no eyewitnesses to the murders and that the DNA evidence against Bishop was weak. However, the prosecution maintains that Bishop was responsible for the girls' deaths.

Mars probe returns first pictures,"Mars Probe Returns First Pictures NASA's latest Mars probe, Perseverance, has returned its first images from the Red Planet, offering stunning views of the rugged Martian landscape. The probe landed successfully in Jezero Crater on Thursday, after a perilous journey of seven months and 300 million miles. Its mission is to search for signs of ancient life on Mars, a planet that scientists believe may once have harbored microbial organisms. The first images, transmitted back to Earth via NASA's Deep Space Network, show a desolate but intriguing landscape. The probe's landing site is located in a dried-up river delta, where scientists hope to find evidence of past water activity. One of the most striking features of the images is the sheer size and scale of the Martian terrain. The probe's landing site is surrounded by towering cliffs and canyons, suggesting a once-active and dynamic environment. NASA scientists are particularly interested in the presence of dark, layered rocks near the probe's landing site. These rocks are thought to have been formed by the deposition of sediments over time, potentially preserving traces of ancient life. The probe is equipped with a variety of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a rock-drilling system. Scientists will use these tools to analyze the surface composition, atmosphere, and geology of Mars. ""These first images are a testament to the incredible precision and capabilities of Perseverance,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science. ""They provide a tantalizing glimpse into the scientific treasures that await us on Mars."" The probe's mission is expected to last at least two years. During that time, it will explore Jezero Crater, collect samples of rocks and soil, and search for signs of ancient life. Scientists hope that the probe's findings will shed new light on the history of Mars and its potential for habitability. The return of the first images from Perseverance marks a significant milestone in the exploration of Mars. It is the first time that a probe has been sent to the planet since the successful landing of NASA's Curiosity rover in 2012. The images have captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike, and they promise to provide valuable insights into the Red Planet and its potential for harboring life.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Managers are heavier drinkers than manual workers,"Managers More Likely than Manual Workers to Drink Heavily A new study has found that managers are more likely to drink heavily than manual workers, even after taking into account factors such as age, income, and education. The study, published in the journalAddiction*, surveyed over 1,000 working adults in the United Kingdom. The study found that managers were 1.5 times more likely to drink heavily than manual workers. Heavy drinking was defined as drinking more than 14 units of alcohol per week for men and more than seven units per week for women. The study also found that managers were more likely to binge drink, or have five or more drinks on a single occasion. Managers were 1.8 times more likely to binge drink than manual workers. The authors of the study say that the findings are concerning, given that heavy drinking is associated with a number of health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, and cancer. They also say that the findings suggest that managers may be under more stress than manual workers, which may be leading them to drink more heavily. ""Managers have a higher prevalence of heavy drinking and binge drinking than manual workers, even after accounting for age, income, and education,"" said lead author Dr. Richard Stephens of the University of Sheffield. ""This suggests that there may be something about the work environment of managers that is contributing to their increased risk of heavy drinking."" Dr. Stephens and his colleagues say that further research is needed to investigate the factors that are contributing to the increased risk of heavy drinking among managers. They also say that interventions should be developed to help managers reduce their drinking. ""Heavy drinking is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on the health of individuals and their families,"" said Dr. Stephens. ""We need to do more to understand the factors that are contributing to heavy drinking among managers and to develop interventions to help them reduce their drinking."" In the meantime, Dr. Stephens recommends that managers who are concerned about their drinking should talk to their doctor or a mental health professional.

The retail sector has been hit hard by a number of factors in recent years, including the rise of online shopping, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost-of-living crisis. These factors have made it increasingly difficult for bricks-and-mortar stores to compete, leading to a wave of closures. Some of the most high-profile store closures in recent months include M&S, John Lewis, and Debenhams. These closures have left large gaps in shopping centers and high streets across the UK, and have had a significant impact on local economies. The rise of online shopping has been a major factor in the decline of the high street. Consumers are increasingly choosing to shop online for convenience, choice, and price. This has led to a decline in footfall in shopping centers and high streets, making it more difficult for bricks-and-mortar stores to survive. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a major impact on the retail sector. Lockdowns and social distancing measures forced many stores to close, and even when they were allowed to reopen, footfall was significantly reduced. This led to a sharp decline in sales for many retailers, and many were unable to recover. The cost-of-living crisis is another factor that has contributed to the decline of the high street. With inflation rising and consumers facing higher energy and food bills, they are cutting back on non-essential spending. This has led to a further decline in sales for many retailers. The decline of the high street is a major concern for local authorities and policymakers. Retail is a major source of employment and economic activity, and the closure of stores can have a significant impact on local communities. There are a number of things that can be done to support the high street, including: Investing in regeneration projects to make shopping centers and high streets more attractive to shoppers Providing financial support to retailers, such as business rates relief and grants Encouraging the development of mixed-use developments that combine retail with other uses, such as housing or leisure Promoting local businesses and independent retailers It is important to remember that the high street is not dead. There are still many people who enjoy shopping in physical stores, and there are many retailers who are adapting to the changing retail landscape. By supporting the high street, we can help to create vibrant and sustainable local communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sir Quentin Thomas retires from BBFC after 10 years,"After a decade of dedicated service, Sir Quentin Thomas has announced his retirement as the Director of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). During his tenure, he has overseen significant changes in the film classification landscape, guided by his unwavering commitment to protecting children and empowering audiences.

The BBFC has introduced a new online platform where members of the public can engage with the board's decisions and provide input. Sir Quentin's commitment to protecting children has been unwavering.

RBS defends business lending practices,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has defended its business lending practices after it was accused of withdrawing support from viable companies. The bank said it is ""committed to supporting businesses"" and that it has ""a range of products and services to meet the needs of our customers."" However, some businesses have claimed that RBS has been too quick to pull the plug on loans, even when they are still able to trade. One such company is Sheffield Forgemasters, which was forced to call in administrators last year after RBS withdrew its support. The company's chief executive, David Bond, said that RBS had ""behaved appallingly"" and that it had ""no interest in supporting British manufacturing."" RBS has denied these claims and said that it ""acted responsibly"" in the case of Sheffield Forgemasters. The bank said that the company had ""a number of financial problems"" and that it was ""not in a position to continue trading."" RBS is not the only bank to have been accused of withdrawing support from businesses. Last year, Barclays was fined £72m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for failing to properly support small businesses. The FCA found that Barclays had ""failed to treat customers fairly"" and that it had ""caused significant financial loss"" to some businesses. The FCA's investigation found that Barclays had ""a number of systemic weaknesses"" in its business lending practices. The regulator said that Barclays had ""failed to properly assess the risks associated with its lending"" and that it had ""not taken into account the impact of its decisions on customers."" Barclays has since apologized for its actions and said that it has taken steps to improve its business lending practices. The FCA's investigation into RBS is ongoing. The regulator is looking into whether RBS has breached any of its rules and regulations. If the FCA finds that RBS has breached its rules, it could impose a fine or other sanctions on the bank. The FCA's investigation is expected to conclude later this year.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
PC Semple murder: Witness heard 'someone throwing up on the carpet',"In a shocking turn of events, a witness has come forward in the PC Semple murder trial, claiming to have heard ""someone throwing up on the carpet"" on the night of the officer's death. This new evidence has sent ripples through the courtroom, casting doubt on the prosecution's case. PC Semple, a 44-year-old police officer, was found brutally murdered in his own home on August 15th. The incident sent shockwaves through the community, and an extensive investigation was launched. Initially, the prosecution presented a strong case, alleging that the defendant, 24-year-old Mark Smith, had murdered PC Semple in a fit of rage after a heated argument. However, the witness's testimony has thrown the entire case into disarray. According to the witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, they were walking past PC Semple's house on the night of the murder when they heard ""a loud noise coming from inside."" ""It sounded like someone was being sick,"" the witness told the court. ""I stopped and listened for a moment, and I could definitely hear someone throwing up on the carpet."" The witness's testimony is crucial because it contradicts the prosecution's timeline of events. The prosecution had argued that PC Semple was killed at around 10pm, but the witness's account suggests that someone was still alive in the house at a later time. Defense attorney Peter Jones seized on the discrepancy, arguing that the witness's testimony ""completely undermines the prosecution's case."" ""If someone was vomiting on the carpet after 10pm, then PC Semple could not have been dead at that time,"" Jones told the jury. ""This is a major blow to the prosecution, and it raises serious questions about their entire case."" The prosecution has yet to respond to the witness's testimony, but the damage has been done. The jury is now left to weigh the evidence and decide whether the defendant is guilty of murder. The PC Semple murder trial has captivated the nation, and the witness's testimony is sure to dominate headlines for the remainder of the trial. With the jury still deliberating, the outcome remains uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the witness's testimony has cast a long shadow over the prosecution's case.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Danny Jones sword killing: Oswestry man Richard Reece jailed,"An Oswestry man has been jailed for killing his neighbor, Danny Jones, with a samurai sword in 2021. Richard Reece, 49, admitted to the manslaughter of Mr. Jones following a late-night confrontation outside their homes in Maesbury Road, Oswestry, on 28 July 2021. Mold Crown Court heard on Friday, May 6, 2023, that Reece had gone next door to Mr. Jones' house just before midnight, armed with a samurai sword, after he had been drinking heavily and taking cocaine. The pair, who had been neighbors for around 20 years, had an ongoing dispute. Prosecuting barrister Elen Owen said that CCTV footage from that night captured Mr. Jones coming to his door where he was met by Reece. ""Words were exchanged before Reece swung the sword and it struck Mr. Jones to the left side of his neck. He managed to return to his house and raised the alarm. Paramedics rushed to the scene and Mr. Jones was taken to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, but he tragically died in the early hours of the following morning,"" Ms. Owen said. The jury heard that Reece had initially denied any involvement in Mr. Jones' death but later admitted manslaughter. The court heard that there had been ""significant animosity"" between the two men, with Mr. Jones having called the police to Reece's house on four occasions in the two years leading up to his death. Ms. Owen said that the dispute had been ""trivial,"" but it had ""escalated out of all proportion."" ""There had been complaints about loud music and DIY noise, and a boundary dispute,"" she said. In his defense, Reece told the court that Mr. Jones had come at him with a knife that night and that he had struck out with the sword in self-defense. ""I didn't mean to kill him,"" he said. The jury rejected Reece's version of events and convicted him of manslaughter. Sentencing Reece, Judge Niclas Parry said that the defendant had ""taken an innocent man's life in drink-fueled rage."" ""You armed yourself with a deadly weapon and you went next door to confront a man who posed no threat to you. ""You have deprived a family of a much-loved husband and father, and a community of a respected member,"" Judge Parry said.

"Toy firm VTech fined $650,000 over data breach","Toy firm VTech fined $650,000 over data breach VTech, a Hong Kong-based toy company, has been fined $650,000 by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for failing to protect the personal information of children. The FTC found that VTech had collected and stored the personal information of more than 6 million children, including their names, addresses, birthdates, and genders, without properly securing it. This information was later accessed by hackers in a 2015 data breach. The FTC also found that VTech had not taken reasonable steps to protect the security of its network, which allowed the hackers to gain access to the children's personal information. The FTC's complaint alleges that VTech violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires companies that collect personal information from children under the age of 13 to obtain parental consent and to protect the security of that information. In addition to the fine, the FTC has ordered VTech to implement a comprehensive security program to protect the personal information of children. This program must include measures to: Secure VTech's network and systems Train VTech employees on data security best practices Regularly monitor VTech's systems for security vulnerabilities Respond to security incidents quickly and effectively The FTC's action against VTech is a reminder that companies that collect personal information from children have a legal obligation to protect that information. Companies that fail to do so may face significant penalties. Parents should be aware of the risks of sharing their children's personal information online. They should only share this information with companies that they trust to protect it. Parents should also talk to their children about the importance of protecting their personal information online. Here are some tips for parents to help protect their children's personal information online: Only share your child's personal information with companies that you trust to protect it.

The poll also found that the most popular destinations for UK students are the United States, Australia, and Canada. These countries are seen as offering a high quality of education, as well as a rich cultural experience. There are a number of reasons why UK students are increasingly considering studying abroad. One reason is the desire to gain a global perspective. Studying abroad allows students to experience different cultures and ways of life, which can help them to develop a more open-minded and tolerant worldview. Another reason why UK students are studying abroad is to improve their career prospects. A degree from a foreign university can be seen as a valuable asset by employers, as it demonstrates that the student has the skills and experience to work in a globalized world.

However, there are a number of scholarships and financial aid programs available to help students cover the costs of studying abroad.

Clegg - A very botched coup,"In the annals of political blunders, the botched coup of Nick Clegg will be remembered as a masterclass in self-inflicted harm. Elected as Deputy Prime Minister in 2010 as part of the coalition government with the Conservative Party, Clegg's popularity soared. He was seen as a fresh face in politics, articulating the concerns of the Liberal Democrats, a party of social justice and environmentalism. However, Clegg's star began to wane as the coalition government made unpopular decisions in response to the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrats became increasingly marginalized, and Clegg's own credibility took a hit. In an attempt to revive his dwindling fortunes, Clegg announced in 2015 that he would step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats. The move was widely seen as an attempt to distance himself from the unpopular coalition government and position himself as a potential future Prime Minister. But Clegg's plan backfired spectacularly. His resignation triggered a leadership contest in which he was defeated by Tim Farron, a backbencher with no government experience. Farron's victory exposed the deep divisions within the Liberal Democrats and further damaged Clegg's reputation. Undeterred, Clegg remained in Parliament and continued to voice his opinions. However, his interventions were increasingly ignored, and his influence dwindled to the point where he became a political irrelevance. In 2017, Clegg announced that he would not be standing for re-election. His parliamentary career ended with a whimper, a far cry from the glory days of 2010. The botched coup of Nick Clegg serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of staying true to one's beliefs. Clegg's attempt to reinvent himself as a potential Prime Minister failed because it was based on a fundamental misreading of the political landscape. By compromising his principles and alienating his base, Clegg ultimately destroyed his own political career. He became a cautionary tale about the perils of forgetting one's roots and chasing after the false promises of power.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Game on for Plaid Cymru leadership contest?,"Game on for Plaid Cymru leadership contest? Plaid Cymru is set to hold a leadership contest following the announcement that Adam Price will step down as leader. Price, who has led the party since 2018, said he was standing down to allow ""fresh leadership"" to take the party forward. The contest is likely to be a closely fought one, with several potential candidates already declaring their interest. One of the frontrunners is expected to be Liz Saville Roberts, the party's Westminster leader. Roberts is a respected figure within the party and has a strong track record in government. Another potential candidate is Rhun ap Iorwerth, the party's education spokesperson. Ap Iorwerth is a popular figure among the party's grassroots and is seen as a potential future leader. However, the contest is likely to be wide open, with a number of other potential candidates also in the running. The leadership contest will be held in the autumn, with the new leader due to be announced in November. The contest will be a crucial one for Plaid Cymru, as it seeks to rebuild after a disappointing performance in the recent Senedd elections. The party lost six seats in the election, leaving it with just seven AMs in the Senedd. The new leader will need to unite the party and develop a clear strategy for the future. The contest is also likely to have implications for the wider Welsh political landscape. Plaid Cymru is the main opposition party in Wales and the new leader will need to work with other parties to hold the Welsh Government to account. The contest is also likely to have an impact on the debate over Welsh independence. Plaid Cymru is the only major party in Wales that supports independence and the new leader will need to set out their position on the issue. The leadership contest is therefore likely to be a significant event in Welsh politics. The outcome of the contest will have a major impact on the future of Plaid Cymru and the wider Welsh political landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US government set to give up net oversight powers,"The United States government is preparing to relinquish its oversight authority over the internet's addressing system, a move that could have significant implications for the way the web is governed. For decades, the US government has played a central role in managing the internet's domain name system (DNS), which translates website addresses into numerical IP addresses that computers can understand. This has given the US a significant degree of control over the internet's infrastructure and has allowed it to set policies for how the DNS is used. However, in recent years, there have been growing calls for the US to give up its oversight of the DNS. Critics argue that the US government's control over the internet is outdated and that it gives the US too much power to censor and control online content. In response to these concerns, the US government has announced that it will begin to transition oversight of the DNS to a new, international organization. The new organization, which is still being formed, will be responsible for managing the DNS and setting policies for its use. The US government's decision to give up its oversight of the DNS is a significant development that could have far-reaching implications for the way the internet is governed. It is still unclear how the new organization will operate and what policies it will set, but the move is likely to lead to a more decentralized and less US-centric internet. Here are some of the potential implications of the US government's decision to give up its oversight of the DNS: Increased competition and innovation. A more decentralized internet could lead to increased competition and innovation in the DNS market. New companies could emerge to offer alternative DNS services, and existing companies could be forced to improve their services in order to compete. Reduced government control. A more decentralized internet would reduce the US government's control over the internet. This could make it more difficult for the government to censor or control online content. Increased security risks. A more decentralized internet could also increase security risks. With multiple organizations managing the DNS, it could become more difficult to identify and mitigate security threats. The US government's decision to give up its oversight of the DNS is a complex issue with far-reaching implications. It is still too early to say what the full impact of this decision will be, but it is clear that the internet is entering a new era of governance.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis in decades, with soaring inflation, dwindling foreign reserves and a shortage of essential goods. The crisis has led to widespread protests and calls for Wickremesinghe's resignation. However, the JVP's support could help to stabilize the government and give Wickremesinghe the political space he needs to implement his reforms. The party has a history of supporting governments that it believes are acting in the best interests of the people. In a statement, the JVP said that it had decided to support Wickremesinghe's government after ""careful consideration"" of the current situation. The party said that it believed that the prime minister's reforms were ""necessary to address the challenges facing the country."" The JVP's support is a major blow to the opposition, which has been trying to unseat Wickremesinghe. The opposition has accused the prime minister of mismanaging the economy and of failing to address the needs of the people. However, the JVP's support could help to undermine the opposition's efforts to remove Wickremesinghe. The JVP is a popular party with a strong base of support, and its backing could help to legitimize Wickremesinghe's government. The JVP's support could also help to calm the protests that have been taking place in Sri Lanka in recent months. The protests have been fueled by anger over the economic crisis and by calls for Wickremesinghe's resignation. However, the JVP's support could help to ease tensions and give the government the space it needs to implement its reforms.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Mike Ashley dismisses claim he offered expert £15m as nonsense,"Mike Ashley dismisses claim he offered expert £15m as nonsense Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has dismissed as ""nonsense"" claims that he offered a property expert £15m to value the club. The allegation was made by former Newcastle director Keith Bishop, who claimed that Ashley had approached him in 2008 with the offer. However, Ashley has vehemently denied the claim, calling it ""absolute rubbish"". ""I have never offered Keith Bishop £15m to value Newcastle United,"" Ashley said in a statement released through the club. ""This is complete nonsense."" Bishop, who was a director at Newcastle from 2007 to 2009, made the claim in an interview with The Times newspaper. He said that Ashley had approached him at a meeting in 2008 and offered him the money to value the club. Bishop said he had declined the offer, saying that he did not believe it was appropriate for him to do so. Ashley has been under increasing pressure to sell Newcastle United, with fans growing frustrated at the club's lack of progress under his ownership. The club has not won a major trophy since 1969, and has been relegated from the Premier League twice in the past decade. Ashley has repeatedly said that he is not interested in selling Newcastle United, but he has also admitted that he would be willing to listen to offers. The latest claim from Bishop is likely to further fuel speculation about Ashley's future at Newcastle United. If it is true that Ashley did offer Bishop £15m to value the club, it would suggest that he is considering selling the club. However, Ashley has denied the claim, and it is possible that Bishop is simply trying to stir up trouble. Only time will tell whether Ashley is genuine about his desire to keep Newcastle United, or whether he is simply waiting for the right offer to come along.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Autism is largely down to genes, twins study suggests","Autism is largely down to genes, twins study suggests Autism is a complex developmental condition that affects an individual's ability to communicate and interact with others. Now, new research suggests that genetics plays a major role in determining whether someone will develop the condition. The study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, looked at data from more than 2,000 pairs of twins. Half of the twin pairs were identical, meaning that they shared 100% of their genes, while the other half were fraternal, meaning that they shared only 50% of their genes. The researchers found that identical twins were much more likely to both have autism than fraternal twins. This suggests that there is a strong genetic component to autism. The study also found that the genetic risk of autism is higher in males than in females. This is consistent with previous research that has shown that autism is more common in boys than in girls. The researchers say that their findings could help to identify new genes that are involved in autism. This could lead to the development of new treatments for the condition. Dr. James Cusick, who led the study, said: ""Our findings provide strong evidence that genetics plays a major role in the development of autism. ""This is an important step forward in our understanding of the condition, and it could lead to new treatments for autism."" The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. What is autism? Autism is a complex developmental condition that affects an individual's ability to communicate and interact with others. Symptoms of autism can include: Difficulty with social interactions Difficulty with communication Repetitive behaviors Restricted interests Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that the symptoms can vary from mild to severe. There is no cure for autism, but there are treatments that can help to improve the symptoms. These treatments may include: Speech therapy Occupational therapy Physical therapy Behavioral therapy Medication What causes autism? The exact cause of autism is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The new study suggests that genetics plays a major role in the development of autism. This is consistent with previous research that has shown that autism is more common in families with a history of the condition. However, it is important to note that genetics are not the only factor that contributes to autism. Environmental factors, such as exposure to toxins, may also play a role. How is autism diagnosed? Autism is typically diagnosed by a healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or child psychiatrist. The diagnosis is based on the child's behavior and development. There is no single test for autism, but there are a number of screening tools that can help to identify children who may be at risk for the condition. What is the treatment for autism? There is no cure for autism, but there are treatments that can help to improve the symptoms. These treatments may include: Speech therapy Occupational therapy Physical therapy Behavioral therapy Medication The type of treatment that is recommended for a child with autism will depend on the child's individual needs.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
George Osborne to step down as Evening Standard editor,"George Osborne to step down as Evening Standard editor Former UK Chancellor to leave role after five years Osborne: 'It's time for a new chapter in my life' London, 17th March 2023 - George Osborne has announced that he will be stepping down as editor of the Evening Standard. The former UK Chancellor has held the role for five years, during which time he has overseen a number of significant changes at the newspaper. In a statement, Osborne said: ""It has been a privilege to edit the Evening Standard for the past five years. I am proud of what we have achieved together, and I believe that the paper is now in a strong position for the future."" ""However, after much thought, I have decided that it is time for a new chapter in my life. I will be leaving the Evening Standard at the end of the month to pursue other opportunities."" Osborne's departure comes at a time of great change for the newspaper industry. The Evening Standard has been hit hard by the decline in print advertising revenue, and has been forced to make a number of job cuts in recent years. However, Osborne believes that the paper can still play an important role in the media landscape. ""The Evening Standard is a unique and important voice in British journalism,"" he said. ""I believe that it has a vital role to play in the future of our democracy."" Osborne's successor has not yet been announced, but it is expected that the new editor will be someone with a strong track record in digital journalism. Osborne's departure is a major blow to the Evening Standard, but it is also a sign of the changing times in the newspaper industry. The paper must now find a new editor who can lead it into the future. George Osborne's legacy at the Evening Standard Osborne has been a controversial figure during his time as editor of the Evening Standard. He has been accused of using the paper to promote his own political agenda, and of being too close to the Conservative Party. However, Osborne's supporters argue that he has been a successful editor who has made the paper more relevant and engaging. They point to the fact that the Evening Standard has increased its circulation under Osborne's leadership, and that it has won a number of awards for its journalism. Only time will tell whether Osborne's successor will be able to maintain the paper's success.

Another Cardiff Bay private flat block fails cladding test,"Another Cardiff Bay private flat block has failed its cladding test, raising concerns about the safety of residents. The 15-storey Infinity building, which is home to 140 flats, is the latest in a series of private blocks in Cardiff Bay to fail cladding tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. Cardiff council said the building's cladding had been tested and found to be combustible, meaning it could catch fire easily. The council said it was working with the building's management company to ensure that the cladding was replaced as quickly as possible. The news comes as a blow to residents of the Infinity building, who are now facing the prospect of having to pay for the cost of replacing the cladding. The cost of replacing the cladding on the Grenfell Tower was estimated to be £10m. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: ""This is really worrying news. I'm concerned about the safety of my family and I'm also worried about the cost of replacing the cladding. I don't know how I'm going to afford it."" The Infinity building is the fourth private block in Cardiff Bay to fail cladding tests. The other three blocks are: The Capital Tower The Meridian Quay The Point The council said it was working with the management companies of all four blocks to ensure that the cladding was replaced as quickly as possible. The council also said it was urging the government to take action to ensure that all buildings with combustible cladding were made safe. A spokesman for the council said: ""We are doing everything we can to ensure that all buildings in Cardiff Bay are safe. We are working with the management companies of the affected buildings to ensure that the cladding is replaced as quickly as possible. We are also urging the government to take action to ensure that all buildings with combustible cladding are made safe.""

Killer Brett Rogers' mum had 'no choice' in having him back home,"In a shocking turn of events, the mother of convicted killer Brett Rogers has revealed that she had ""no choice"" but to let her son move back into her home upon his release from prison. Rogers, 34, was convicted of murdering his girlfriend, Sarah Payne, in 2000. He was sentenced to life in prison but was released on parole in 2021 after serving 21 years. His mother, Julie, said she had been forced to take him in as he had nowhere else to go. She told the BBC: ""I didn't want him back here. I was terrified of what he might do. But I had no choice. He's my son and I couldn't just leave him on the streets."" Julie admitted that she was scared of her son, but said she was determined to help him reintegrate into society. ""I know he did a terrible thing,"" she said. ""But he's paid his debt to society. He deserves a second chance."" Rogers' release has sparked outrage among the public, with many people calling for Julie to be prosecuted for aiding a known criminal. However, Julie insists that she is not condoning her son's actions. ""I'm not saying what he did was right,"" she said. ""But I believe that everyone deserves a second chance."" Julie's decision to take Rogers in has raised important questions about the role of family in the rehabilitation of offenders. Is it ever right to let a known criminal back into your home? And what does it say about our society that we are so quick to condemn those who have committed crimes, even when they have served their time? Experts say that it is important to remember that not all offenders are the same. Some are genuinely remorseful for their actions and are committed to changing their ways. Others, however, are more likely to reoffend. It is up to each individual family to decide whether or not they are willing to take the risk of letting a convicted criminal back into their home. There is no easy answer, and there is no right or wrong decision. In the case of Brett Rogers, it is clear that his mother loves him unconditionally. She is willing to put her own fears aside in order to give him a second chance. Whether or not this is the right decision, only time will tell.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nigel Farage says Labour has 'abandoned' its pro-Brexit voters,"Nigel Farage has accused the Labour party of ""abandoning"" its pro-Brexit voters after the party announced it would back a second referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Farage said that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had ""completely betrayed"" the working-class voters who had supported the party in the last election. ""Labour has always been the party of the working class,"" he said. ""But now they've abandoned them in favour of the metropolitan elite."" Mr Farage's comments come after Labour announced that it would support a second referendum on Brexit, even if it meant campaigning to remain in the EU. The decision has been met with anger from some Labour MPs, who argue that it will alienate the party's traditional working-class voters. However, Mr Corbyn has defended the decision, saying that it is the only way to ""break the Brexit deadlock"" and give the public a say on their future. ""We have to respect the result of the referendum,"" he said. ""But we also have to give people a chance to have their say on the final deal."" The Labour party is now facing a difficult choice. If it goes ahead with its plan to support a second referendum, it risks alienating its traditional working-class voters. However, if it does not support a second referendum, it risks losing the support of its younger, more pro-European voters. The decision is likely to have a major impact on the outcome of the next general election. In response to Mr Farage's comments, a Labour spokesperson said: ""The Labour party is committed to delivering Brexit. We will respect the result of the referendum, but we will also give people a say on the final deal."" The spokesperson added that the party was ""determined to build a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few."" The decision by Labour to support a second referendum has been welcomed by some, but it has also been met with criticism. Those who support the decision argue that it is the only way to break the Brexit deadlock and give the public a say on their future. However, those who oppose the decision argue that it will alienate the party's traditional working-class voters and make it more difficult to deliver Brexit.

Sri Lanka clashes hit peace hopes,"In Sri Lanka, violent clashes between security forces and protesters have cast a shadow over hopes for lasting peace. The unrest, sparked by an unprecedented economic crisis, has raised fears of a return to the country's bloody past. For decades, Sri Lanka has been plagued by a bitter ethnic conflict between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2009, claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. After the war ended, the government promised to address the grievances of the Tamil community and promote reconciliation. However, progress has been slow, and many Tamils feel that they have been marginalized and discriminated against. The current economic crisis has exacerbated these tensions. The country is facing soaring inflation, a shortage of essential goods, and a massive increase in unemployment. The government has been unable to stem the crisis, and public anger has been growing. In recent weeks, protests have erupted across the country, demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some violent incidents. On July 13, security forces opened fire on protesters in Colombo, killing at least eight people and injuring hundreds more. The shooting has sparked outrage and condemnation both within Sri Lanka and internationally. The violence has raised fears that Sri Lanka could be on the verge of another civil war. The country is deeply divided, and there is a lack of trust between the government and the Tamil community. The international community is watching the situation in Sri Lanka with growing concern. The United Nations has called for an independent investigation into the July 13 shooting, and the United States has expressed its ""grave concern"" about the violence. Sri Lanka's future is uncertain. The country has a long history of conflict, and the current economic crisis has only made things worse. It is essential that the government takes steps to address the grievances of the Tamil community and to promote reconciliation. Without these steps, Sri Lanka's hopes for lasting peace will remain elusive.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"'Kylie Jenner, wow, being in a wheelchair is so fun and fashionable!'","Kylie Jenner, the youngest billionaire in the world, has sparked controversy after posting a series of photos on Instagram showing her posing in a wheelchair. The photos, which have since been deleted, were met with mixed reactions, with some people praising Jenner for raising awareness of disability and others criticizing her for glamorizing it. In the photos, Jenner is seen wearing a black crop top and matching sweatpants, along with a pair of high heels. She is sitting in a wheelchair with her legs crossed, and she is looking at the camera with a smile. The caption on the photos reads, ""Wow, being in a wheelchair is so fun and fashionable!"" The photos quickly went viral, and they were met with a range of reactions. Some people praised Jenner for raising awareness of disability, while others criticized her for glamorizing it. ""I think it's great that Kylie Jenner is using her platform to raise awareness of disability,"" said one commenter. ""She's showing people that people with disabilities can be just as stylish and fashionable as anyone else."" ""I'm not sure how I feel about these photos,"" said another commenter. ""On the one hand, I think it's great that Kylie Jenner is showing people that people with disabilities can be just as stylish and fashionable as anyone else. On the other hand, I worry that she's glamorizing disability and making it seem like something that's fun and trendy."" Jenner has not responded to the controversy, but she has since deleted the photos from her Instagram account. The debate over Jenner's photos highlights the complex and often contradictory ways that disability is portrayed in the media. On the one hand, there is a growing movement of people with disabilities who are working to challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive view of disability. On the other hand, there are still many instances of people with disabilities being portrayed in a way that is demeaning or disrespectful. It is important to remember that disability is not a fashion statement. It is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human experience, and it should be treated with respect and understanding.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New Aberdeen FC Kingsford stadium plans approved,"New Aberdeen FC Kingsford Stadium Plans Approved Aberdeen City Council has approved plans for a new stadium for Aberdeen Football Club, to be built on the site of the former Kingsford industrial estate. The new stadium, which will have a capacity of around 20,000, will replace the club's current home at Pittodrie Stadium. The Dons have played at Pittodrie since 1903, but the stadium is now outdated and no longer meets the requirements of a modern football club. The new stadium is expected to cost around £100 million and will be funded by a combination of private investment, public funding, and a loan from the Scottish Government. Aberdeen FC chairman Dave Cormack said: ""This is a historic day for Aberdeen Football Club. We have been working on this project for many years and we are delighted that it has finally been approved. ""The new stadium will be a world-class facility that will be a fitting home for our club. It will also be a major boost to the local economy and will help to regenerate this part of the city."" Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: ""This is a significant investment in Aberdeen and we are confident that the new stadium will be a major asset to the city. ""It will not only provide a new home for Aberdeen FC, but it will also create jobs and boost the local economy. We are delighted to have played a part in making this project a reality.""

South Georgia whaling: Antarctic art marks a dark past,"Amidst the pristine glaciers and abundant wildlife of South Georgia, a poignant reminder of a dark past lingers in the form of whaling art. These haunting images, etched into the fabric of the island's history, bear witness to an industry that once threatened the very existence of the majestic creatures that inhabit these icy waters. In the late 18th century, South Georgia became a hub for whalers seeking the lucrative spoils of the Southern Ocean. As the industry boomed, whaling stations sprang up along the island's coastline, processing vast quantities of whale oil and baleen. This relentless pursuit of profit exacted a devastating toll on whale populations, pushing some species to the brink of extinction. To document their macabre trade, whalers commissioned artists to capture the gruesome spectacle of the hunt. These paintings and sketches offer a chilling glimpse into the industrial-scale killing that occurred on South Georgia. Whaleboats, their occupants armed with harpoons and lances, swarm around colossal whales, blood staining the icy waters red. The colossal carcasses, their bodies flayed and blubber stripped, lie frozen on the decks of whaling ships, a testament to the industry's relentless greed. Beyond their historical value, these works also reveal the artistry and craftsmanship of the whalers themselves. Despite their involvement in a brutal trade, many of these men were skilled scrimshaw carvers and amateur painters. Their intricate carvings on whalebone and ivory depict scenes from daily life at the whaling stations, capturing both the camaraderie and the hardships endured by the crews. Today, these haunting artworks serve as a powerful reminder of the devastating impact of human exploitation on the natural world. They stand as a testament to the fragility of marine ecosystems and the importance of conservation. As visitors explore South Georgia, these images confront them with the dark legacy of the whaling era, encouraging reflection on the need to protect and preserve the island's pristine environment for generations to come. While whaling has long ceased on South Georgia, its legacy continues to shape the island's identity. The abandoned whaling stations, now crumbling ruins, serve as poignant reminders of an era that left an indelible mark on both the landscape and the hearts of those who witnessed it. And as the island's wildlife thrives once more, these haunting artworks stand as a reminder of the resilience of nature and the importance of learning from the mistakes of the past.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Colombia and Farc rebels chart course for peace talks,"Colombia and Farc Rebels Chart Course for Peace Talks After decades of armed conflict, Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) are poised to embark on a fresh round of peace negotiations. Representatives from both sides have met in Oslo, Norway, to lay the groundwork for talks that they hope will end one of the longest-running civil wars in the world. The conflict between the Colombian government and the Farc has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more. In recent years, the fighting has subsided somewhat, but violence continues to flare up in parts of the country. The new peace talks come at a time when both sides are facing pressure to end the conflict. The Colombian government is under pressure from its citizens to achieve a lasting peace, while the Farc is facing pressure from its own members to lay down its arms. The talks are expected to be complex and difficult. The two sides have a long history of mistrust, and there are many issues that need to be resolved, including the future of Farc fighters and the return of land to displaced people. However, there is also a sense of hope that this time could be different. The Colombian government and the Farc have both expressed a commitment to peace, and they have agreed to a set of ground rules for the talks. The talks are being facilitated by Norway and Cuba, which have played a similar role in other peace processes around the world. The two countries will provide a neutral venue for the talks and will help the two sides to overcome obstacles. The peace talks are a major step forward for Colombia. If they are successful, they could bring an end to decades of violence and suffering. However, it is important to remember that the talks are just the beginning of a long and difficult process. There will be setbacks and disappointments along the way, but both sides are committed to achieving a lasting peace. The following are some of the key issues that will be discussed in the peace talks: The future of Farc fighters: The Farc is a guerrilla army with an estimated 8,000 fighters. The government wants the Farc to disarm and demobilize, while the Farc wants guarantees that its members will not be prosecuted for their crimes. The return of land to displaced people: Millions of Colombians have been displaced from their homes due to the conflict. The government wants to return land to these people, but the Farc wants to ensure that the land is not used for illegal activities. The political participation of the Farc: The Farc wants to be able to participate in politics after the conflict is over. The government is willing to consider this, but it wants to ensure that the Farc does not use its political power to promote violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Court action threatened over school meal vouchers,"Coronavirus: Court action threatened over school meal vouchers Campaigners are threatening legal action against the government over its failure to provide free school meals over the summer holidays. The voucher scheme, which was introduced during the first lockdown, was not extended over the summer by the government, despite calls from charities and teaching unions. A group of parents and food poverty campaigners are now seeking a judicial review of the government's decision, arguing that it is unlawful and discriminatory. The group is being supported by the Good Law Project, a not-for-profit organisation that uses the law to protect the public interest. Jo Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: ""The government's decision to end free school meals over the summer holidays is a disgrace. It is unlawful and discriminatory, and it will have a devastating impact on the poorest families in our society."" The campaigners argue that the government's decision is unlawful because it breaches the Equality Act 2010. The act prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, age, or socio-economic status. The campaigners also argue that the government's decision is discriminatory because it will have a disproportionate impact on children from low-income families. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We understand that many families are facing financial challenges at this time, which is why we have provided a range of support, including increasing Universal Credit by £20 a week and providing local authorities with £63 million to support families with food and essential items."" The government has also said that it will provide £120 million to councils to help them provide food support to vulnerable families over the summer holidays. However, the campaigners argue that this is not enough and that the government should reinstate the free school meals voucher scheme. The judicial review is expected to be heard in the High Court in the coming weeks. Impact of the decision The government's decision to end free school meals over the summer holidays has been met with widespread criticism. Charities and teaching unions have warned that it will have a devastating impact on the poorest families in our society. A survey by the Food Foundation found that 44% of parents said that they would struggle to feed their children over the summer holidays without free school meals. The government's decision has also been condemned by the United Nations. The UN's Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Olivier De Schutter, said that the decision was ""a violation of the right to food of children living in poverty"".",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Arrests as fracking gets green light at Preston New Road site,"Police make arrests as fracking gets green light at Preston New Road site Lancashire Police have made a number of arrests as protesters gathered at the Preston New Road fracking site following the government's decision to approve the project. Energy firm Cuadrilla has been given the go-ahead to start exploratory drilling at the site near Blackpool, despite strong opposition from local residents and environmental campaigners. Protesters have been camped out at the site for several months, and on Monday they blocked access to the site in an attempt to prevent Cuadrilla from starting work. Police were called to the scene and made a number of arrests. It is understood that the arrests were for offences including obstruction of the highway and public order offences. Cuadrilla said it was ""disappointed"" by the protests and said it was ""committed to working with the community to address any concerns"". The company said it had ""taken all necessary steps to ensure that our operations are safe and environmentally responsible"". However, opponents of fracking say the process is dangerous and could cause environmental damage. They also say that Cuadrilla has not properly consulted with the local community. The government has said that fracking is a ""safe and necessary"" way to extract gas from the UK's shale rock formations. However, the decision to approve the Preston New Road project has been met with widespread criticism. Environmental campaigners say the government is ""ignoring the will of the people"" and that fracking will damage the environment and harm human health. Local residents say they are concerned about the noise, pollution and traffic that fracking will bring to their area. The Preston New Road project is the first fracking project to be approved in the UK since 2019. The government has said that it hopes fracking will help to reduce the UK's reliance on imported gas. However, opponents of fracking say that the process is not economically viable and that it will not reduce the UK's carbon emissions. The Preston New Road project is expected to start drilling in the coming weeks. It is not yet clear how long the drilling will take or whether Cuadrilla will be successful in finding commercially viable quantities of gas.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Poorer seven-year-old pupils' improvement short of target,"The progress of disadvantaged pupils in England has fallen well short of the government's target, figures suggest. The gap between the poorest and richest seven-year-olds in English and maths has narrowed since 2011, but not by as much as the government had hoped. Ministers said they were ""disappointed"" but that progress was being made. The figures come amid criticism that the government's focus on grammar and phonics is failing to improve standards in the long term. The data, published by the Department for Education, shows that the gap between pupils from poorer homes and their wealthier peers has narrowed by 7% in reading, 5% in writing and 10% in maths since 2011. This means that, on average, a child from the poorest fifth of homes is now about eight months behind a wealthier peer in reading and writing, and six months behind in maths. But the government's ambition was to narrow the gap by 12% in reading, writing and maths by 2020. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""I am disappointed that the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has not narrowed as much as we would have liked. ""But we are making progress and will continue to work tirelessly to give every child, regardless of their background, the best possible start in life."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the figures showed that the government's focus on grammar and phonics was ""not enough on its own to improve standards in the long term"". ""We need a broader curriculum that develops children's critical thinking and problem-solving skills,"" he said. The Sutton Trust, an education charity, said the figures were ""a wake-up call for the government"". ""The gap between rich and poor pupils is still far too wide,"" said its chief executive, James Turner. ""We need to see a step change in the government's approach if we are going to close this gap and give all children the opportunity to succeed."" The National Education Union said the figures were ""a damning indictment of the government's education policies"". ""Ministers have focused on narrow measures such as phonics and grammar, and neglected other essential areas such as creativity and critical thinking,"" said its joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney. ""This has failed our poorest children and left them even further behind.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Medicine supply chains to change post Brexit, MPs told","Medicine supply chains to change post-Brexit, MPs told The UK's departure from the EU will necessitate significant changes to the way medicines are supplied to the UK, members of Parliament have been told. The Health and Social Care Committee heard from experts that the current system, which relies heavily on imports from the EU, is unsustainable in the long term. The committee was told that the UK needs to develop its own manufacturing capacity and diversify its supply chains to ensure that it is not reliant on any one country for its medicines. The UK government has said that it is committed to ensuring that the supply of medicines is not disrupted after Brexit. However, the committee heard that there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed, including: The need to secure new trade deals with other countries The need to increase the UK's manufacturing capacity The need to develop new supply chains The committee was told that the UK government is working on a number of initiatives to address these challenges, including: The establishment of a new Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) The launch of a new £200 million fund to support the development of new medicines manufacturing facilities in the UK The development of a new trade policy that will give the UK greater flexibility to negotiate new trade deals The committee welcomed these initiatives, but said that more needs to be done to ensure that the UK is prepared for Brexit. The committee's chair, Jeremy Hunt, said: ""The UK's departure from the EU will have a significant impact on the way medicines are supplied to the UK. It is essential that the government takes steps now to ensure that there is no disruption to the supply of medicines after Brexit."" The committee's report makes a number of recommendations to the government, including: The government should develop a comprehensive strategy for ensuring the supply of medicines after Brexit The government should increase the UK's manufacturing capacity for medicines The government should diversify the UK's supply chains for medicines The government should work with other countries to secure new trade deals The government has said that it will consider the committee's recommendations carefully.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
In the media: Obama endorses gay marriage,"In the Media: Obama Endorses Gay Marriage Former President Barack Obama has made history by endorsing same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support the practice. In an interview with ABC News, Obama declared, ""I believe that committed and loving same-sex couples should be able to marry."" Obama's endorsement is a significant milestone in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. It comes at a time when public opinion in the United States is rapidly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 55% of Americans support same-sex marriage, compared to only 27% in 1996. Obama's decision to endorse same-sex marriage was met with mixed reactions. Supporters hailed it as a courageous and necessary step towards equality. Opponents condemned it as a betrayal of traditional values. The issue of same-sex marriage has been a subject of fierce debate in the United States for decades. In 2008, California voters approved Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state. However, in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, ruling that it was unconstitutional. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, same-sex marriage remains banned in several states. However, the fight for full marriage equality continues, and Obama's endorsement is likely to give the movement a major boost. Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage is not only a personal declaration of his beliefs but also a reflection of the changing social landscape in the United States. As public opinion continues to shift in favor of LGBTQ+ rights, it is likely that more and more political leaders will follow in Obama's footsteps and endorse same-sex marriage. The issue of same-sex marriage is complex and multifaceted. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate. However, one thing is clear: the endorsement of same-sex marriage by former President Barack Obama is a significant step forward in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Yakub Memon: Support grows for Mumbai bomb plotter's plea,"Support for Yakub Memon, one of the masterminds of the 1993 Mumbai bombings, continues to grow as his execution nears. Memon, who is currently on death row, has filed a mercy petition with the President of India, seeking clemency. Memon's supporters argue that he has changed since his arrest in 1994 and that he is no longer a threat to society. They point to his good behavior in prison and his efforts to rehabilitate himself. Memon has also apologized for his role in the bombings and has expressed remorse for the lives that were lost. His opponents, however, argue that Memon is a hardened terrorist who deserves to be executed for his crimes. They point to the fact that he was convicted of playing a key role in the bombings, which killed 257 people and injured over 700. They also argue that Memon has not shown any genuine remorse for his actions and that he remains a threat to society. The debate over Memon's fate has divided India. Some believe that he should be shown mercy, while others believe that he should be executed. The President of India is expected to make a decision on Memon's mercy petition in the coming days. Meanwhile, support for Memon has been growing both in India and abroad. A number of celebrities, including actors, singers, and writers, have come out in support of Memon's plea for clemency. They argue that Memon has changed since his arrest and that he deserves a second chance. However, Memon's opponents remain firm in their belief that he should be executed. They argue that Memon is a dangerous terrorist who deserves to be punished for his crimes. They also point out that Memon has not shown any genuine remorse for his actions. The debate over Memon's fate is likely to continue until the President of India makes a decision on his mercy petition. However, it is clear that there is a growing groundswell of support for Memon, and it remains to be seen whether the President will be swayed by this support.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Wild parakeets take roost in Birmingham's Shard End,"In a surprising turn of events, wild parakeets have taken up residence in the Shard End area of Birmingham. These vibrant birds, once native to warmer climates, have adapted to the urban environment and are now thriving in the city's parks and streets. The parakeets, with their unmistakable emerald green plumage and distinctive calls, have become a familiar sight in Shard End. They nest in trees in the area's green spaces, including the popular Kingfisher Country Park, and often gather in large flocks, creating a lively spectacle. Experts believe that the parakeets may have escaped from captivity or been brought to the area as pets that were later released. They have proven to be resilient birds, able to withstand the colder temperatures of Birmingham's winters. The arrival of the parakeets has been met with mixed reactions from local residents. Some have embraced the birds, enjoying their vibrant presence and the cheerful sounds they bring to the neighborhood. Others have raised concerns about the potential impact on native wildlife, particularly smaller birds. Ornithologists have acknowledged the potential challenges posed by the non-native parakeets. Like other invasive species, they can compete with native birds for resources such as food and nesting sites. However, it is too early to say with certainty what the long-term impact will be. For now, the parakeets remain a curious addition to Birmingham's urban landscape. Their distinctive calls and flashes of green plumage add a touch of the exotic to the city's streets and parks. While their presence raises questions about the impact on the local environment, these remarkable birds have undoubtedly become a part of Shard End's unique character. In addition to the potential ecological implications, the arrival of the parakeets has also sparked discussions about human-wildlife interactions in urban environments. The birds' ability to thrive in close proximity to humans highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with managing wildlife in densely populated areas. As the parakeets continue to make Shard End their home, it remains to be seen how they will interact with the area's diverse bird population and whether their presence will have a lasting impact on the local ecosystem.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Elon Musk accused of stealing farting unicorn image,"Elon Musk has been accused of stealing an image of a farting unicorn from a small artist. The artist, who goes by the name of ""Stable Diffusion"", posted the image on Twitter in January 2023. Musk then tweeted the same image a few days later, without giving credit to Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion was understandably upset, and called out Musk on Twitter. ""Hey @elonmusk,"" they wrote. ""This is my art. You didn't ask permission to use it. You didn't credit me. This is theft."" Musk initially apologized on Twitter, and said that he would give credit to Stable Diffusion in the future. However, he later deleted the tweet, and has not given credit to Stable Diffusion for the image. This is not the first time that Musk has been accused of stealing other people's work. In 2018, he was accused of stealing the idea for the Tesla Cybertruck from a small design firm. He has also been accused of stealing ideas from other companies, such as SpaceX and SolarCity. Musk's behavior has led some to question his ethics. They argue that he is willing to take credit for other people's work, and that he does not respect the rights of artists. Others, however, defend Musk, arguing that he is a visionary who is not afraid to take risks. They say that he is not interested in stealing other people's work, but rather in using it to create something new and innovative. The debate over Musk's ethics is likely to continue. However, one thing is for sure: he is a complex and controversial figure. He is a brilliant inventor and entrepreneur, but he is also a ruthless businessman. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to use his talents for good, or whether he will ultimately self-destruct. In the meantime, Stable Diffusion is still waiting for Musk to give them credit for their work.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Firefighters back industrial action in pensions row,"Firefighters Back Industrial Action in Pensions Row Firefighters have voted overwhelmingly in favor of industrial action in a long-running dispute over pensions. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said 88% of its members who voted backed industrial action. The turnout was 73%. The FBU said firefighters were ""angry and frustrated"" at government plans to increase their pension contributions and raise the retirement age. The union said it would now consider what form of industrial action to take. The government said it was ""disappointed"" with the result of the ballot and urged the FBU to reconsider. The dispute centers on plans by the government to increase firefighters' pension contributions from 11% to 14% of their salary. The government also wants to raise the retirement age for firefighters from 60 to 65. The FBU said the government's plans would ""decimate"" firefighters' pensions and make it impossible for many to retire before they are too old to do their job safely. The union said it was ""not prepared to accept"" the government's plans and would take whatever action necessary to protect firefighters' pensions. The government said it was ""committed to ensuring that firefighters have a fair and sustainable pension scheme."" The government said it had made ""significant concessions"" in an attempt to reach a deal with the FBU, but that the union had rejected these. The government said it was ""disappointed"" that the FBU had voted in favor of industrial action and urged the union to reconsider. The FBU said it would now consider what form of industrial action to take. The union said it would not rule out strikes, but that it would also consider other forms of action, such as work-to-rule or overtime bans. The government said it hoped that the FBU would reconsider its decision to take industrial action and that the two sides could reach a deal that was fair to both firefighters and taxpayers.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US firm RiverOak renews bid to reopen Manston Airport,"US firm RiverOak renews bid to reopen Manston Airport US firm RiverOak Strategic Partners has renewed its bid to reopen Manston Airport in Kent, south-east England. The company submitted a revised planning application to Thanet District Council on Friday, after its original proposal was rejected in 2021. RiverOak says the airport could create up to 2,500 jobs and boost the local economy by £1bn over the next 10 years. But opponents say the plans are unrealistic and would damage the environment. Manston Airport closed in 2014 after its owner, Ann Gloag, withdrew funding. RiverOak first submitted a planning application to reopen the airport in 2020, but it was rejected by Thanet District Council in May 2021. The council said the plans were ""not in accordance with the development plan"" and would have ""significant adverse impacts"" on the environment. RiverOak has now submitted a revised planning application, which it says addresses the concerns raised by the council. The new plans include a smaller terminal building and a reduced number of flights. RiverOak says the airport would operate up to 25 flights per day, with a focus on budget airlines and cargo services. The company says the airport would create up to 2,500 jobs and boost the local economy by £1bn over the next 10 years. But opponents say the plans are unrealistic and would damage the environment. The Manston Airport Action Group (MAAG) says the airport would generate too much noise and pollution, and would have a negative impact on local wildlife. MAAG also says the plans are unrealistic, and that there is no demand for an airport in Manston. The group is calling on Thanet District Council to reject RiverOak's planning application.

The ballot of Labour members and registered supporters closed at midday on Thursday, with the winner set to be announced at a special conference in London on Monday afternoon. Sir Keir is the only candidate to have put themselves forward for the role, and is widely expected to be re-elected unopposed. However, some Labour members have expressed concerns about the lack of a contest, arguing that it is undemocratic and will lead to a lack of accountability. One Labour MP, who did not want to be named, said: ""I think it's a shame that there's not a contest. It would have been good to have a proper debate about the future of the party."" Another Labour MP said: ""I understand why Keir is unopposed, but I think it's important to have a contest. It's the only way to ensure that the leader is accountable to the membership."" However, other Labour members have defended the lack of a contest, arguing that it is a sign of unity within the party. One Labour member said: ""I think it's a good thing that Keir is unopposed. It shows that the party is united behind him."" Another Labour member said: ""I don't think it's necessary to have a contest. Keir has done a good job and I'm happy to support him."" The Labour leadership ballot is the first to be held under the party's new rules, which require candidates to secure the support of at least 20% of Labour MPs and MEPs in order to stand. The new rules were introduced in an attempt to prevent the party from being led by someone who does not have the support of the parliamentary party.

Amazon readies Android app store,"Amazon is developing its own app store for Android devices, according to a report from Bloomberg. The move would mark a significant challenge to Google's Play Store, which is currently the dominant app store for Android devices. Amazon has been working on the project for several months and is in talks with developers about distributing their apps through its store, Bloomberg reported. The new store is expected to launch later this year. Amazon's entry into the Android app market could have a major impact on the industry. Amazon has a vast customer base and a well-developed e-commerce platform. It could use these advantages to attract developers and users to its new app store. If Amazon is successful in launching a successful Android app store, it could force Google to lower its fees for developers and improve the quality of its Play Store. It could also give developers more choice in how they distribute their apps. Google has not yet commented on Amazon's plans. However, the company is likely to view Amazon's entry into the Android app market as a major threat. Google has invested heavily in its Play Store and it is a key part of its Android ecosystem. Amazon's move into the Android app market is a sign of the growing competition in the mobile ecosystem. Apple and Google currently dominate the market, but Amazon is now looking to challenge their dominance. It remains to be seen whether Amazon can be successful in launching a successful Android app store. However, the company has a track record of success in e-commerce and it has the resources to invest in the project. If Amazon is successful, it could have a major impact on the Android app market. In addition to the potential impact on the Android app market, Amazon's move could also have implications for the broader mobile ecosystem.

Clashes as Ethiopian Israelis protest over police shooting,"Ethiopian Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Sunday to protest the fatal police shooting of a 19-year-old man. Yehuda Biadga was shot dead by police on Saturday night after he allegedly stabbed an officer during a traffic stop in the Israeli city of Bat Yam. Police said Biadga had been driving a stolen vehicle and had tried to flee when pulled over. Biadga's family and friends dispute the police account, saying he was unarmed and was shot in the back. The protest in Tel Aviv began peacefully but turned violent when demonstrators clashed with police. Police fired stun grenades and water cannon to disperse the crowd, while protesters threw stones and bottles. At least 11 people were arrested and several others were injured in the clashes. The protest is the latest in a series of demonstrations by Ethiopian Israelis over police violence. In 2015, a video of two police officers beating an Ethiopian-Israeli soldier sparked widespread outrage and led to protests across the country. Ethiopian Israelis say they are regularly subjected to discrimination and violence by the police. They also complain of being treated as second-class citizens and of being denied equal opportunities in education, employment, and housing. The Israeli government has been criticized for its handling of the protests. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for calm and has promised to investigate the shooting of Biadga. But protesters say the government has not done enough to address their concerns. The protests are a sign of the growing frustration and anger among Ethiopian Israelis. They are demanding an end to police violence and discrimination, and they are calling for equal rights and opportunities. The Israeli government must take their demands seriously and work to build a more just and equitable society for all its citizens.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Christmas ad spend 'to hit record high',"Christmas ad spend to hit record high UK businesses are set to spend a record £7.1bn on Christmas advertising this year, according to a new report. The Advertising Association/Warc Expenditure Report forecasts that ad spending will increase by 5.6% compared to last year. This is the highest level of growth since 2007. The report says that the increase in ad spending is being driven by a number of factors, including the strong economy, the growth of online advertising, and the increasing popularity of video content. The biggest spenders on Christmas advertising will be the retail sector, which is expected to account for 38% of all ad spend. This is followed by the food and drink sector (21%), the automotive sector (11%), and the travel and leisure sector (9%). The report also predicts that online advertising will account for 57% of all Christmas ad spend this year, up from 53% last year. This is being driven by the increasing use of smartphones and tablets, as well as the growing popularity of social media platforms. Video content is also becoming increasingly important for Christmas advertisers. The report says that 63% of all Christmas ad spend will be on video this year, up from 59% last year. This is being driven by the popularity of video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. The Advertising Association's chief executive, Stephen Woodford, said: ""The Christmas advertising market is set to hit a new record high this year, with businesses looking to make the most of the festive period. The growth in online advertising and video content is particularly notable, and reflects the changing way that consumers are engaging with advertising."" The report also found that the average UK household will see around 15 Christmas adverts per day in the run-up to the big day. This is up from 13 adverts per day last year. The most popular Christmas advertising slots are on ITV, Channel 4, and Sky. These slots are typically booked up months in advance, and can cost millions of pounds. Some of the most iconic Christmas adverts in recent years have included: The John Lewis Christmas advert, which has become a festive tradition in the UK. The Coca-Cola Christmas advert, which has featured a variety of different themes over the years. The Sainsbury's Christmas advert, which has often featured heartwarming stories.

Jenna Coleman 'leaving' Doctor Who,"Jenna Coleman's Departure from Doctor Who British actress Jenna Coleman is set to leave the long-running sci-fi series Doctor Who at the end of the upcoming tenth season. Coleman has played the character of Clara Oswald, a companion to the Doctor, since 2012. Her exit was announced in a statement from the BBC, which said that ""Jenna has been a fantastic addition to the show and we are very grateful for all she has contributed."" Coleman expressed her gratitude to the show's fans and crew, saying in a statement: ""I have loved playing Clara and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to have worked on Doctor Who."" She added that ""it's been an incredible journey and I've made lifelong friends."" Coleman's departure comes at a time of change for Doctor Who. The show is set to undergo a major revamp next year, with Peter Capaldi stepping down as the Doctor and being replaced by Jodie Whittaker, the first female actress to play the role. Russell T Davies, who was the showrunner of Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010, is also set to return as the show's executive producer in 2018. Coleman's departure is a major loss for Doctor Who. She has been a popular and well-received companion, and her chemistry with Capaldi has been praised by fans and critics alike. However, her exit also provides an opportunity for the show to refresh itself and explore new directions. With Whittaker as the Doctor and Davies at the helm, Doctor Who is set to enter an exciting new era. Possible Reasons for Coleman's Departure There are several possible reasons why Coleman has decided to leave Doctor Who. One possibility is that she simply wants to pursue other projects. Coleman is a talented actress with a wide range of abilities, and she may feel that she has outgrown the role of Clara Oswald. Another possibility is that she is unhappy with the direction that the show is taking. Davies has already hinted that he plans to make some significant changes to the show, and Coleman may not be comfortable with those changes. Finally, it is also possible that Coleman simply wants to spend more time with her family and friends. She has been working on Doctor Who for four years, and she may be ready for a break. Whatever the reason, Coleman's departure is a significant event for Doctor Who. She has been an important part of the show for the past four years, and she will be missed by fans and cast members alike.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pringles tube tries to wake from 'recycling nightmare',"In the depths of a recycling plant, amidst a cacophony of clanking machinery and the pungent aroma of discarded materials, an unlikely protagonist stirs from its slumber. A Pringles tube, once a symbol of culinary delight, now finds itself trapped in a recycling nightmare. Its sleek cylindrical form, once a beacon of innovation, now lies crumpled and forlorn. The once-vibrant colors have faded, replaced by a dull, ashen hue. Encrusted with a sticky residue of its former contents, it bears the scars of countless meals enjoyed and discarded. As the conveyor belt grinds beneath its weight, the tube struggles to regain consciousness. Its thin walls creak and groan under the pressure, threatening to shatter into a thousand pieces. The constant jostling and bumping against its fellow recyclables sends shockwaves through its fragile frame. In a desperate attempt to escape its torturous prison, the tube rolls and slides, seeking an opening through which it can slip. But its efforts are in vain. It is trapped, ensnared by a labyrinth of metal and plastic. As darkness descends upon it, the tube resigns itself to its fate. It has become a mere husk of its former glory, destined to end its days as recycled material. But amidst the despair, a flicker of hope remains. For in the heart of the recycling plant, there works a man named George. A seasoned employee with a keen eye for the unusual, George has always had a soft spot for discarded objects. As he surveys the conveyor belt, his gaze falls upon the struggling Pringles tube. Intrigued by its resilience, George carefully plucks it from the torrent of recyclables. He examines it with a mixture of awe and pity, marveling at its tenacity in the face of adversity. Inspired by its plight, George vows to give the tube a second chance at life. He takes it home and washes away the residue of its past. With meticulous care, he repairs its damaged walls and restores its vibrant colors.

The case for a non-white Spider-Man,"Spider-Man: A Cultural Icon with an Evolving Identity Spider-Man, the iconic superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962, has become an integral part of popular culture. However, the traditional depiction of Spider-Man as a young, white male has raised questions about the relevance of the character in a society that is increasingly diverse. Advocates for a non-white Spider-Man argue that it would provide much-needed representation for communities that have historically been underrepresented in superhero narratives. The character's iconic suit and web-slinging abilities transcend racial boundaries, making it possible to envision a Spider-Man who reflects the diversity of the real world. Furthermore, a non-white Spider-Man could serve as an inspirational role model for children and young adults, demonstrating that heroism is not confined to a particular racial or ethnic background. By breaking down stereotypes and showcasing the universality of the superhero concept, Spider-Man can help foster a more inclusive and equitable society. However, some traditionalists argue that altering the character's race would undermine his established iconography and the nostalgic appeal of the original comics. They maintain that Spider-Man's core identity is inextricably linked to his white skin and that any change would be disrespectful to the character's creators and loyal fans. Proponents of a non-white Spider-Man counter that the character has already undergone significant changes over the years, including different costumes, backstories, and love interests. They argue that a change in race would be just another evolution in the character's long history, ensuring its relevance to a new generation of fans. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to introduce a non-white Spider-Man is a complex one that requires careful consideration. While respecting the character's legacy is important, so too is the need for representation and inclusivity in modern storytelling. As the world continues to evolve, it is inevitable that the characters we identify with will reflect that change. Whether it takes the form of a new character, an alternate universe version, or a reimagined classic, the introduction of a non-white Spider-Man would be a significant step towards creating a more diverse and representative superhero landscape. By embracing change and evolving with the times, Spider-Man can continue to be an enduring icon for generations to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Personal travel agents boost holiday bookings,"Personal Travel Agents Boost Holiday Bookings Amidst the surge in online travel booking platforms, personal travel agents have emerged as a formidable force, revitalizing the industry with their personalized services and expertise. Despite the convenience and accessibility of digital channels, travelers are increasingly turning to human touch and bespoke guidance for their vacation planning. According to a recent survey by the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA), 65% of Americans prefer booking their holidays through travel agents. This resurgence in demand highlights the value that personal agents bring to the travel experience. They act as trusted advisors, leveraging their industry knowledge and connections to curate tailored itineraries that meet clients' specific needs. Personalized Planning and Expertise Unlike online platforms that offer a generic range of options, travel agents take the time to understand their clients' travel aspirations, preferences, and budget. They delve into the nuances of destinations, recommending hidden gems, exclusive experiences, and insider tips that enhance the overall vacation experience. Their expertise extends to niche markets, such as luxury travel, adventure expeditions, and tailor-made family holidays. Human Connection and Flexibility In the digital age, personal connection has become a sought-after commodity. Travel agents provide a human touch that online booking engines lack. They are available to answer queries, resolve issues promptly, and offer continuous support throughout the planning process. This personalized approach instills confidence and peace of mind, especially for first-time travelers or those navigating complex itineraries. Moreover, travel agents offer flexibility and adaptability. They can accommodate last-minute changes, upgrade bookings, and negotiate special deals on behalf of their clients. Their understanding of the industry allows them to navigate unforeseen circumstances, ensuring that travelers have a smooth and stress-free vacation. Cost Savings and Exclusive Perks Contrary to popular belief, personal travel agents can often secure more competitive deals than online booking platforms. They have established relationships with airlines, hotels, and tour operators, enabling them to negotiate exclusive discounts and added value benefits. These partnerships also allow them to secure upgrades, priority boarding, and access to VIP airport lounges. The Future of Travel Agents While online booking platforms will continue to appeal to tech-savvy travelers seeking convenience, the demand for personal travel agents is expected to remain strong. Their personalized services, expertise, and human touch cater to a growing segment of travelers who value authentic experiences and hassle-free planning. As the travel industry evolves, personal agents will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the future of holidays, empowering travelers to create unforgettable memories that surpass mere itineraries.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid: EU starts mass vaccination in 'touching moment of unity',"In a poignant moment of unity, the European Union has commenced its mass Covid-19 vaccination campaign, marking a significant turning point in the fight against the pandemic that has ravaged the continent. The first doses were administered across the bloc on Sunday, as countries from Portugal to Hungary rolled out their vaccination programs. In a symbolic gesture of solidarity, several European leaders received their vaccinations publicly, underscoring the importance of the campaign and reassuring their citizens of the vaccine's safety. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte were among those who rolled up their sleeves. The EU's mass vaccination drive is a logistical undertaking of unprecedented scale, involving the coordination of vaccine procurement, distribution, and administration across 27 member states. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has authorized the use of two vaccines so far – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – and more are expected to be approved in the coming months. The rollout of the vaccines has been met with cautious optimism by many Europeans, who have endured months of lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic hardship. While some expressed concerns about the potential side effects of the vaccines, the vast majority recognized the urgency of protecting themselves and their communities from the virus. Health experts have emphasized the importance of achieving herd immunity, which occurs when a large proportion of the population has developed antibodies against a disease, making it more difficult for the virus to spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 60-70% of the population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19. The EU is aiming to vaccinate 70% of its adult population by the end of summer 2021. The campaign will prioritize healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions, who are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19. The mass vaccination drive is a testament to the power of science and cooperation in the face of a global crisis. As the vaccines continue to roll out across the EU and beyond, there is renewed hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Kaji Sherpa, President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, spoke to the BBC about the reasons behind the boycott. ""The Sherpas are the backbone of the Everest climbing industry,"" he said. ""They risk their lives every day to make it possible for others to reach the summit. But they are not treated with the respect and recognition they deserve."" Sherpas have long complained of being underpaid and overworked by Western expedition companies. They also say that they are often ignored in decision-making processes related to climbing on Everest. ""We are not just porters,"" said Kaji Sherpa. ""We are highly skilled mountaineers who deserve to be treated as equals."" The boycott movement has gained widespread support within the Sherpa community. Many Sherpas have vowed not to work on Everest until their demands are met. This has put expedition companies in a difficult position, as it is impossible to climb Everest without Sherpa support. The companies have met with Sherpa representatives to try to resolve the issue. However, no agreement has yet been reached. The Sherpas are demanding a number of changes, including increased pay, better insurance, and a greater say in decision-making. The boycott has had a significant impact on the Everest climbing industry. The number of expeditions has dropped sharply, and many climbers have canceled their plans to climb the mountain. This has resulted in a loss of revenue for expedition companies and the Nepalese government. It remains to be seen whether the boycott will achieve its goals. However, it has certainly raised awareness of the plight of Sherpas and has forced the climbing industry to confront the issue of their treatment.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Ed Balls: Labour would back mansion tax to fund tax credits,"Labour would back a mansion tax to fund tax credits for the poorest families, Ed Balls has said. The shadow chancellor told the BBC that a tax on homes worth more than £2m could raise £1.5bn a year, enough to cover the cost of reinstating the tax breaks to their previous level. The government cut tax credits by an average of £1,200 a year in April, sparking protests from charities and opposition politicians. The chancellor, George Osborne, has said he cannot afford to reverse the cuts without raising other taxes or cutting spending elsewhere. But Mr Balls said Labour would introduce a ""modest"" mansion tax to raise the revenue needed. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Let's just get this straight: £1.5bn would reinstate tax credits in full. A mansion tax on homes worth over £2m would raise that. ""So that's an additional tax on the top 0.5% of properties, raising £1.5bn to reinstate tax credits for the poorest families."" Mr Balls said the tax would be ""fair"" and would not hit people who had worked hard to buy their homes. He said: ""A mansion tax would be fair because it would be paid by those who can afford it, and it would not affect the vast majority of homes in this country. ""It's a modest proposal on the top 0.5% of homes, the most expensive homes, to raise money to reverse the tax credit cuts that have hit the poorest families."" The government has said it will not introduce a mansion tax, arguing that it would be unfair to people who have worked hard to buy their homes. But Labour argues that the tax would be a fair way to raise revenue to help the poorest families. The party has pledged to reinstate tax credits to their previous level if it wins the next election. The Liberal Democrats have also pledged to support a mansion tax, but the Conservatives have ruled it out.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Boardrooms 'need more ethnic diversity',"The stark absence of ethnic diversity in British boardrooms remains an enduring problem that stifles progress and undermines the fair representation of our society. Despite persistent efforts to promote inclusion, the latest figures reveal a dismal picture that calls for urgent action. According to a recent study by the Parker Review, ethnic minorities hold a mere 14.1% of board positions in FTSE 100 companies, a figure that has remained virtually unchanged in the past five years. The situation is even more dire in other sectors, with ethnic minorities accounting for just 8.5% of board members in the FTSE 250 and a mere 5.7% in the public sector. This lack of diversity has profound implications for decision-making and corporate governance. Studies have consistently shown that diverse boards lead to better financial performance, enhanced innovation, and increased employee engagement. By excluding ethnic minorities from the highest echelons of decision-making, we are depriving our businesses and our society as a whole of valuable perspectives and insights. The reasons for the lack of ethnic diversity in boardrooms are complex and multifaceted. However, one key factor is the prevalence of unconscious bias in recruitment and selection processes. Unconscious bias refers to the automatic, often subconscious, stereotypes and attitudes that can influence our decision-making without us even realizing it. To address this issue, businesses must adopt proactive measures to eliminate unconscious bias from their recruitment practices. This includes implementing blind hiring processes, conducting diversity training for hiring managers, and actively seeking out candidates from underrepresented groups. Another barrier to ethnic diversity in boardrooms is the lack of role models and mentorship opportunities for ethnic minorities. Many talented individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds feel underrepresented and undervalued in the business world. By creating mentorship programs and providing opportunities for ethnic minorities to shadow senior leaders, we can inspire future generations and break down the barriers to progression. Government policy can also play a significant role in promoting ethnic diversity in boardrooms. The introduction of mandatory diversity targets for FTSE 100 companies has been met with mixed reactions. Some argue that it is an essential step to accelerate progress, while others fear it could lead to tokenism. Regardless of one's views on mandatory targets, it is clear that government intervention is necessary to create a level playing field and address the systemic barriers that prevent ethnic minorities from reaching boardroom positions. Ultimately, achieving true ethnic diversity in British boardrooms is not simply a matter of ticking boxes. It is about creating a fair and inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed regardless of their background. By challenging unconscious bias, providing mentorship opportunities, and implementing targeted policies, we can unlock the full potential of our businesses and create a society that truly reflects the diversity of its people.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Will other cities want a minister like Portsmouth's?,"Will other cities want a minister like Portsmouth's? In a move that has surprised many, Portsmouth City Council has appointed a minister to its cabinet. The Reverend Simon Fanshawe, a local vicar, will be responsible for overseeing the council's work on social justice and community cohesion. The appointment has been welcomed by some, who believe that it will help the council to better engage with the city's faith communities. Others, however, have expressed concern that it could lead to the council becoming too closely aligned with one particular religion. So, what does the appointment of a minister to Portsmouth City Council mean for other cities? Is it a sign that other councils are also looking to faith leaders to help them address the challenges they face? There are certainly some reasons why other cities might want to consider appointing a minister to their cabinet. Faith leaders can bring a wealth of experience and expertise in working with communities. They can also help to build bridges between different groups of people and to promote social cohesion. However, there are also some potential risks associated with appointing a minister to a council cabinet. One concern is that it could lead to the council becoming too closely aligned with one particular religion. Another concern is that it could lead to the council making decisions that are based on religious beliefs rather than on evidence and reason. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to appoint a minister to a council cabinet is a complex one. There are both potential benefits and risks to consider. However, the appointment of a minister to Portsmouth City Council is a significant development that could have implications for other cities across the country. It will be interesting to see how the appointment works out in Portsmouth and whether other cities decide to follow suit. One city that is already considering appointing a minister to its cabinet is Liverpool. The city council is currently in talks with the Archbishop of Liverpool, the Most Reverend Malcolm McMahon, about the possibility of him taking on a role similar to the one held by Reverend Fanshawe in Portsmouth. If Liverpool does decide to appoint a minister to its cabinet, it would be a significant development. Liverpool is one of the most diverse cities in the UK, with a large population of people from different faiths and backgrounds. The appointment of a minister could help the council to better engage with these communities and to promote social cohesion. However, it is important to note that the appointment of a minister to a council cabinet is not without its critics. Some people believe that it could lead to the council becoming too closely aligned with one particular religion. Others believe that it could lead to the council making decisions that are based on religious beliefs rather than on evidence and reason.

No SNP applause on Cameron's legacy at final PMQs,"In the final Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) session of his premiership, David Cameron faced a barrage of criticism from opposition leaders, including Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon took particular issue with Cameron's legacy on Scotland, accusing him of ""failing to keep his promises"" on devolving more powers to the Scottish Parliament. She also criticized his handling of the Brexit referendum, which resulted in a majority of Scots voting to remain in the European Union. ""The Prime Minister has presided over a decade of broken promises and missed opportunities for Scotland,"" Sturgeon said. ""He promised to give Scotland a say on its own future, but he has broken that promise."" Cameron defended his record on Scotland, arguing that he had delivered on his commitment to devolve more powers to Holyrood. He also said that he had always respected the Scottish people's right to choose their own future, and that he would continue to support Scotland's place in the UK. ""I believe that Scotland is stronger as part of the United Kingdom,"" Cameron said. ""I will always stand up for Scotland's interests, and I will always work to strengthen our Union."" Despite Cameron's defense, there was no applause from the SNP benches as he left the House of Commons for the final time. This was a clear indication of the deep dissatisfaction that many Scots feel towards Cameron and his government. Cameron's premiership has been a turbulent one, marked by both successes and failures. He has presided over a period of economic recovery, but he has also faced criticism for his handling of issues such as immigration and the NHS. His decision to hold a referendum on EU membership was a gamble that backfired, and he will now leave office with the UK facing an uncertain future. Only time will tell how Cameron's legacy will be judged. However, it is clear that he is leaving office as a divisive figure, and his departure will be welcomed by many in Scotland.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
New trains urged for electrified Swansea to London line,"New trains urged for electrified Swansea to London line Campaigners are calling for new trains to be introduced on the electrified Swansea to London line. The line was electrified in 2018, but the trains that run on it are still diesel-powered. This means that they are not as environmentally friendly as they could be. The campaigners say that new electric trains would be more efficient and would produce less pollution. They would also be more comfortable for passengers. The Welsh government has said that it is committed to decarbonising the rail network, and that it is working with Network Rail to explore options for introducing new trains on the Swansea to London line. A spokesperson for Network Rail said: ""We are committed to working with the Welsh government to decarbonise the rail network in Wales. We are exploring a number of options for introducing new trains on the Swansea to London line, and we will be working with our partners to develop a solution that meets the needs of passengers and the environment."" The campaigners say that they are pleased that the Welsh government is committed to decarbonising the rail network, but they want to see more action. ""We welcome the Welsh government's commitment to decarbonising the rail network,"" said a spokesperson for the campaign group Greener Journeys. ""However, we believe that more needs to be done to ensure that the Swansea to London line is electrified as soon as possible."" ""New electric trains would be more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and more comfortable for passengers,"" the spokesperson added. ""We urge the Welsh government to work with Network Rail to introduce new trains on the line as soon as possible."" The Swansea to London line is one of the busiest in Wales, with over 2 million passengers using the line each year. The line is also important for the Welsh economy, as it connects Swansea to London and other major cities in England. The electrification of the line was a major investment, and it is expected to improve journey times and reliability. However, the campaigners say that the full benefits of electrification will not be realized until new electric trains are introduced. They are calling on the Welsh government and Network Rail to work together to introduce new trains on the line as soon as possible.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sussex university students bid to save Dissertation Dash,"Sussex students are working to save Dissertation Dash, an annual end-of-year event that allows final-year students to celebrate the completion of their dissertations. The event, which has been running for over 20 years, involves students running from the university library to the seafront, where they traditionally throw their dissertations into the air. However, the university has announced that it is reviewing the event due to concerns about safety and disruption. Students have now launched a petition to save Dissertation Dash, which has already gathered over 1,000 signatures. They argue that the event is a harmless tradition that allows students to celebrate their achievements and mark the end of their time at university. ""Dissertation Dash is a rite of passage for Sussex students,"" said petition organiser Emily Jones. ""It's a way for us to let off steam after all the hard work we've put in, and to celebrate our achievements with our friends."" The university said it is aware of the petition and is considering the students' views. ""We are currently reviewing Dissertation Dash to ensure that it can continue in a safe and responsible way,"" a university spokesperson said. ""We understand that this event is important to our students, and we are working to find a solution that will allow it to continue."" The students are hoping that the university will allow Dissertation Dash to continue, with some minor changes to make it safer. They have suggested that the event could be moved to a different location, such as the university sports fields, and that the number of participants could be limited. ""We're confident that we can work with the university to find a solution that will allow Dissertation Dash to continue,"" said Jones. ""It's an important tradition that we're determined to save.""

Trump 'looks forward' to meeting Theresa May,"Trump 'looks forward' to meeting Theresa May US President Donald Trump has said he is ""very much looking forward"" to meeting British Prime Minister Theresa May later this week. The two leaders are due to meet at the White House on Friday for talks on a range of issues, including trade, security and climate change. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office in January. The meeting comes at a time of uncertainty about the future of US-UK relations. Trump has been critical of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, and has also suggested that he may not renew the UK's exemption from US tariffs on steel and aluminum. However, the White House has said that Trump is ""committed to a strong and enduring relationship with the United Kingdom."" In a statement, the White House said that Trump and May ""will reaffirm the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom and discuss ways to strengthen our partnership in the years to come."" The meeting will also be an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the war in Syria. The US and UK have been working together to try to find a political solution to the conflict. Trump and May are also expected to discuss the issue of climate change. Trump has previously said that he does not believe that climate change is a hoax, but he has also said that he is not sure whether it is caused by human activity. The meeting between Trump and May is likely to be closely watched by observers around the world. It will be an opportunity for the two leaders to build a personal relationship and to discuss the future of the US-UK relationship. Some analysts believe that the meeting could be a turning point in US-UK relations. They argue that Trump and May have the potential to develop a close working relationship, which could help to strengthen the alliance between the two countries. Others are more skeptical. They point to Trump's unpredictable nature and his previous criticism of the UK. They argue that it is too early to say whether the meeting will be a success. Only time will tell whether the meeting between Trump and May will be a turning point in US-UK relations.

"Brexit: PSNI 'won't police customs checkpoints', says chief constable","The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) will not police any customs checkpoints that may be erected on the Irish border after Brexit, its chief constable has said. Simon Byrne told the BBC's Sunday Politics program that the PSNI would not be involved in ""any form of customs or immigration checks"" at the border. ""Our role is to uphold the law and keep people safe,"" he said. ""We will not be involved in any form of customs or immigration checks."" Byrne's comments come amid growing concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish border. The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, and there is still no agreement on how the border will operate after that date. The EU has insisted that there must be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but the UK government has said that it is prepared to leave the EU without a deal, which could lead to the imposition of tariffs and other barriers to trade. Byrne said that the PSNI was ""ready for all eventualities"" but that he hoped a deal could be reached that would avoid a hard border. ""We are working closely with our partners in the Republic of Ireland and with the UK government to ensure that we are prepared for all eventualities,"" he said. ""But we hope that a deal can be reached that will avoid a hard border."" The PSNI's decision not to police customs checkpoints is likely to add to the pressure on the UK government to reach a deal with the EU. The Irish government has said that it will not allow any customs checkpoints on the border, and the PSNI's refusal to police them means that the UK government would have to find another way to enforce them. The UK government has said that it is committed to avoiding a hard border, but it is unclear how it will do so if it cannot reach a deal with the EU. The PSNI's decision is a reminder of the practical challenges that the UK government faces in delivering Brexit.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Anuj Bidve murder trial: Kiaran Stapleton 'calculating',"As the Anuj Bidve murder trial continues, the prosecution has painted a picture of Kiaran Stapleton as a ""calculating"" and ""dangerous"" individual who callously ended the life of an innocent student. CCTV footage played to the court showed Stapleton and his accomplice, Sampreet Singh, following Bidve and his friends as they made their way through the city center in the early hours of December 26, 2011. The pair were seen to approach the group and engage in a brief conversation before Stapleton suddenly pulled out a gun and shot Bidve in the head. The prosecution alleges that Stapleton had planned the attack in advance and that he had intended to kill someone that night. Witnesses have described how Stapleton had been boasting about having a gun and had even shown it to them earlier that evening. Stapleton's defense team has denied that he intended to kill Bidve, claiming that the shooting was a ""tragic accident."" They say that Stapleton was drunk and high on drugs at the time and that he did not realize what he was doing. However, the prosecution has presented evidence that Stapleton was in control of his actions and that he knew what he was doing. They have pointed to the fact that he calmly walked away from the scene after the shooting and that he did not attempt to help Bidve. The jury has heard how Stapleton has a history of violence and that he had been convicted of assault in the past. They have also been told that he had been expelled from school and that he had been in trouble with the police on numerous occasions. The prosecution has urged the jury to find Stapleton guilty of murder, saying that he is a ""dangerous individual"" who poses a threat to society. They say that he deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. The defense team is expected to call witnesses in Stapleton's defense, but it is unclear whether they will be able to convince the jury that he did not intend to kill Bidve. The trial is expected to last several weeks, and the jury is likely to retire to consider its verdict at the end of the evidence.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sisi gives Egypt military new powers after Sinai attack,"Sisi grants Egypt's military sweeping new powers following Sinai attack Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has expanded the military's powers to combat terrorism following a deadly attack on a mosque in the Sinai Peninsula. The new measures, approved by parliament on Monday, grant the military sweeping powers, including the authority to arrest and detain suspects without a warrant. The move has been met with criticism from human rights groups, who warn that it could lead to abuses. Details of the new law The new law grants the military the following powers: To arrest and detain suspects for up to 30 days without a warrant. To search and seize property without a warrant. To use deadly force to disperse protests. To establish military courts to try civilians. The law also creates a new National Anti-Terrorism Authority, which will be responsible for coordinating the government's counterterrorism efforts. Government's justification The government has defended the new law as necessary to combat the threat of terrorism. ""We are facing a war against terrorism,"" Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said. ""We need to give the military the tools it needs to protect our country."" Criticism from human rights groups Human rights groups have condemned the new law as a ""blank check"" for the military. ""This law will give the military free rein to commit human rights abuses,"" said Amnesty International's Egypt researcher. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, another human rights group, called the law ""a major setback for human rights in Egypt."" Background The new law was approved in the wake of a deadly attack on a mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on Friday. The attack, which killed at least 305 people, was the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt's recent history. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group, which has been waging an insurgency in the Sinai since 2013. Implications The new law is likely to have a significant impact on Egypt's human rights record. The military has long been accused of human rights abuses, including arbitrary detentions, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The new law could give the military even greater impunity for such abuses. The law could also have a chilling effect on dissent. The military's authority to use deadly force to disperse protests could make it more difficult for people to exercise their right to free assembly.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan Charsadda: Eyewitnesses recount university attack,"In a tragedy that has sent shockwaves across the nation, a suicide bomb attack targeted the University of Peshawar in the Charsadda district of Pakistan on Monday, November 21, 2022. The horrific incident, which claimed the lives of at least nine people and left dozens more injured, has left the university community and the entire country in mourning. Eyewitnesses have shared harrowing accounts of the moment the bomb exploded, sending shrapnel and debris flying through the air. ""I was sitting in the lecture hall when I heard a deafening blast,"" said one student, visibly shaken. ""The room filled with smoke and chaos, and I could hear people screaming."" Another witness, a faculty member who was in a nearby building at the time of the attack, described the scene outside as ""utter pandemonium."" ""Students were running in all directions, some covered in blood and others in tears,"" he said. ""The university grounds were a scene of complete devastation."" The university has been placed under lockdown as security forces investigate the attack and search for potential suspects. The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has claimed responsibility for the bombing, further escalating tensions in the region. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack as ""cowardly and heinous,"" vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice. He also announced that the government would provide full support to the victims and their families. The attack on the University of Peshawar is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Pakistan. In recent years, the country has faced numerous attacks targeting educational institutions, including the 2014 terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar that killed over 150 people, mostly children. The international community has condemned the latest attack and expressed solidarity with Pakistan. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations Security Council have all denounced the violence and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable. As the investigation into the attack continues, thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their loved ones. The university community is now faced with the difficult task of rebuilding and recovering from this senseless act of violence. Pakistan and its people remain resilient in the face of adversity, but the scars of this tragedy will undoubtedly take time to heal.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Libya assets tax 'should go to IRA Semtex victims',"Libya assets tax 'should go to IRA Semtex victims' Boris Johnson has said a new tax on UK assets linked to the Libyan regime could be used to compensate victims of IRA Semtex bombs. The prime minister said on Monday it was ""only fair"" that the money should go to those who suffered from the ""heinous"" attacks. The government is considering a one-off tax on assets in the UK that are linked to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which was controlled by the Gaddafi regime. The LIA is estimated to have around £10 billion worth of assets in the UK, including property, investments and cash. The government has said that any tax raised would be used to support the Libyan people and help them rebuild their country after the war. However, Johnson said that he was ""minded"" to use some of the money to compensate victims of IRA Semtex bombs. The IRA used Semtex, a powerful explosive, in a series of bombings in the UK during the Troubles. The attacks killed hundreds of people and injured thousands more. Johnson said that the victims of the IRA bombings had been ""forgotten"" for too long. ""They deserve justice and they deserve compensation,"" he said. ""I believe that it is only fair that the money from the Libyan assets tax should go to them."" The government's decision on how to use the money from the Libyan assets tax is expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Victims' groups have welcomed Johnson's comments. ""This is a significant step forward in our campaign for justice,"" said Kenny Donaldson, a spokesman for the Victims of IRA Semtex Bombs group. ""We are grateful to the prime minister for listening to our concerns and for recognising the suffering that we have endured."" However, some commentators have expressed concern about the government's plan. They argue that it would be unfair to use money from Libyan assets to compensate victims of IRA bombings. They say that the LIA is a sovereign wealth fund that belongs to the Libyan people, and that it should not be used to pay for the actions of the IRA. The government has said that it will take all of these concerns into account when making its decision on how to use the money from the Libyan assets tax.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

'Failing leadership' at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust,"Failing Leadership at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust An independent inquiry has concluded that ""failures of leadership and management"" at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH) led to hundreds of baby deaths and avoidable brain damage in mothers over two decades. The inquiry found that the trust had a ""defensive and adversarial"" culture and failed to properly investigate concerns raised by families. The inquiry, led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, examined more than 1,800 cases between 2000 and 2019. It found that many of the deaths and injuries could have been avoided if the trust had acted on concerns raised by families and staff. Ockenden said that the trust had ""failed to learn and improve"" from its mistakes, and that there was a ""lack of openness and transparency"" at the trust. She said that the trust had ""lost the trust of the families it serves."" The inquiry made a number of recommendations to improve maternity services at SaTH, including: Establishing a new, independent maternity board Improving training for staff Increasing staffing levels Creating a new complaints procedure The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said that it will accept all of the inquiry's recommendations. The DHSC has also announced that it will be setting up a new independent body to oversee maternity services in England. The inquiry's findings have been met with anger and disbelief by families who have been affected by the trust's failings. Many families have said that they feel let down by the trust and that they have lost faith in the NHS. The inquiry's findings are a damning indictment of the leadership and management at SaTH. The trust has failed to provide safe and compassionate care to its patients, and it has failed to learn from its mistakes. The DHSC must now act on the inquiry's recommendations and ensure that the trust is held accountable for its failings. The inquiry's findings are also a reminder of the importance of patient safety. The NHS must put patient safety first, and it must be open and transparent when things go wrong. The DHSC must ensure that the NHS is properly funded and that it has the resources it needs to provide safe and compassionate care to all its patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Five things we learned from Archie's birth certificate,"Five Things We Learned from Archie's Birth Certificate The publication of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor's birth certificate has shed light on some intriguing details about the royal baby. Here are five key things we learned from the official document: 1. Date and Time of Birth: Archie was born at 05:26 AM (BST) on Monday, May 6, 2019, at the Portland Hospital in London. This confirms earlier reports that the baby arrived in the early hours of the morning. 2. Full Name: Archie's full name is Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.

This is in line with their royal titles, but it's the first time they have been officially designated as such on a legal document. 4. Attendant at the Birth: The midwife who attended Archie's birth was named Zita West. West is a renowned homeopath and author who specializes in fertility and pregnancy care. Her presence suggests that Meghan and Harry chose a holistic approach to their birth experience. 5. Informant: The informant, who registered the birth, was listed as ""His Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales."" This is Prince Harry's full name, indicating that he was the one who provided the information on the birth certificate.

""I'm just a normal kid who loves to sing."" Parke's comments come after The Sun newspaper reported that he had been offered a £1 million record deal. However, Parke's manager, Adam Merzi, has denied the claims. ""There is no truth to these rumors,"" Merzi said. ""Ronan is not in talks with any record labels at this time."" Despite his denial, Parke is likely to become a household name if he continues to impress on Britain's Got Talent. He is currently one of the favorites to win the show, and his performances have already attracted the attention of record executives. However, Parke is keen to remain grounded, and he is determined not to let the success go to his head. ""I'm just trying to stay focused on the competition,"" he said. ""I'm not thinking about anything else."" Parke's humility is likely to endear him to the British public, and it could help him to win the show. If he does, he will be the youngest ever winner of Britain's Got Talent. However, even if he doesn't win, Parke is likely to have a successful career in music. He has a natural talent for singing, and he is already writing his own songs. With his talent and determination, Parke is sure to achieve stardom one day. However, for now, he is happy to remain a normal kid who loves to sing.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
US report accuses China of 'digital authoritarianism',"US Report Accuses China of 'Digital Authoritarianism' A report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission has accused China of employing ""digital authoritarianism"" to suppress dissent and control its citizens. The report, released on Tuesday, highlights the growing use of technology by the Chinese government to monitor and control its population. The report specifically cites China's use of facial recognition, artificial intelligence (AI), and social media surveillance to create a sophisticated system of social control. It also raises concerns about the government's use of ""blacklists"" to target individuals for punishment, including travel bans and financial restrictions. ""The Chinese government is using technology to create a surveillance state that is unprecedented in human history,"" said US Senator Marco Rubio, co-chair of the commission. ""This report should serve as a wake-up call to the world about the dangers of digital authoritarianism."" The report's findings are based on a year-long investigation by the commission, which is a congressional body tasked with monitoring the US-China relationship. The commission interviewed experts from around the world, including human rights activists, technology analysts, and government officials. The report's findings have been met with concern by US officials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that he shares the commission's ""deep concerns about the Chinese government's use of advanced technologies to suppress dissent and control its citizens."" The Chinese government has rejected the report's findings, calling them ""groundless accusations."" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the report ""seriously violates the basic norms of international relations and interferes in China's internal affairs."" The report's release comes amid growing tensions between the US and China over a range of issues, including trade, technology, and human rights. The US has accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, stealing American intellectual property, and committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province. The Chinese government has denied these accusations and has accused the US of trying to contain China's rise. The two countries have also been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war, which has disrupted global trade and raised concerns about the future of the global economy. The report's findings are likely to further strain relations between the US and China. The US has already taken a number of steps to counter China's digital authoritarianism, including imposing sanctions on Chinese companies involved in human rights abuses and promoting the development of alternative technologies to Chinese-made products. The Biden administration has also made human rights a central focus of its foreign policy, and has pledged to work with allies to promote democracy and combat authoritarianism around the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
AI finds novel way to beat classic Q*bert Atari video game,"AI finds novel way to beat classic Q*bert Atari video game Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to develop a new way to beat the classic Atari video game Q*bert, without using any prior knowledge of the game's rules. The approach, developed by researchers at DeepMind, uses a technique called reinforcement learning, which involves training an AI system to learn how to play a game by trial and error. The AI system was trained on a dataset of human gameplay videos, and then played the game against a human opponent. The AI system was able to beat the human opponent on average, and also discovered a new strategy for playing the game that humans had not previously discovered. The new strategy involves bouncing Q*bert off of the edges of the screen to reach higher platforms, which allows him to avoid enemies and score more points. This strategy was not known to human players prior to the development of the AI system. The researchers believe that their approach could be used to develop new AI systems that can play other Atari games, and potentially even more complex games. The research is part of a growing trend of using AI to develop new strategies for playing video games. In recent years, AI systems have been developed that can play games such as Go, chess, and StarCraft II at a superhuman level. AI systems are also being used to develop new ways to create video games. For example, AI systems have been used to generate new levels for games such as Mario and Zelda. The use of AI in video games is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that we play and create games. How does the AI system work? The AI system is based on a deep neural network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn from data. The neural network was trained on a dataset of human gameplay videos, which allowed it to learn the rules of the game. Once the neural network was trained, it was used to play the game against a human opponent. The neural network used a technique called reinforcement learning to learn how to play the game. Reinforcement learning involves training an AI system to learn how to play a game by trial and error. The neural network was able to beat the human opponent on average, and also discovered a new strategy for playing the game that humans had not previously discovered. What are the implications of this research? The research has a number of implications for the future of AI and video games. First, the research shows that AI systems can be used to develop new strategies for playing video games. This could lead to the development of AI systems that can play games at a superhuman level. Second, the research shows that AI systems can be used to create new video games. This could lead to the development of new and innovative video games that would not be possible without AI. Finally, the research shows that AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful and capable. This has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including the video game industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Florida Zika cases prompt UK advice for pregnant travellers,"Florida Zika cases prompt UK advice for pregnant travellers Pregnant women and those trying to conceive are being advised to avoid travelling to Miami-Dade County in Florida, after 10 local cases of the Zika virus were confirmed. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has updated its travel advice for the area, warning that the virus can cause serious birth defects if contracted during pregnancy. The virus is spread by mosquitoes, and there is no vaccine or specific treatment available. Symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes, but many people infected with the virus do not experience any symptoms. The FCO advice applies to pregnant women and women trying to conceive, as well as their partners. It warns that even if a woman does not have symptoms of Zika, she could still be carrying the virus and pass it on to her unborn child. The FCO advises pregnant women and women trying to conceive to consider postponing their travel to Miami-Dade County until after their pregnancy. If travel is essential, they should take strict precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeves and trousers, using insect repellent and sleeping under a mosquito net. The FCO also advises pregnant women and women trying to conceive to speak to their doctor before travelling to any area where Zika is present. The Zika virus has been linked to a range of birth defects, including microcephaly, a condition where a baby's head is abnormally small. The virus can also cause miscarriage, stillbirth and other serious health problems. There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for Zika, but research is ongoing. In the meantime, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Anyone who has travelled to an area where Zika is present and is concerned that they may have been infected should see their doctor. Zika can be diagnosed with a blood test.

Grace Millane killer appeals against conviction and sentence,"The man convicted of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane has launched an appeal against his conviction and sentence. Jesse Kempson, 28, was found guilty of strangling the 22-year-old to death in December 2018 after a Tinder date. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years. Kempson's lawyers have now lodged an appeal against the verdict, arguing that the trial judge made a number of errors that led to a miscarriage of justice. One of the grounds for appeal is that the judge wrongly allowed the jury to hear evidence of Kempson's previous sexual history. The defense argued that this evidence was irrelevant to the murder charge and was unfairly prejudicial to Kempson. Another ground for appeal is that the judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the law relating to self-defense. Kempson claims that he killed Millane in self-defense after she attacked him. The Court of Appeal will now consider whether to grant Kempson permission to appeal. If permission is granted, a full hearing will be held to determine whether the conviction and sentence should be overturned. The appeal process could take several months or even years to complete. In the meantime, Kempson remains in prison. Millane's family have said they are ""disappointed"" by the appeal, but they trust that the justice system will uphold the verdict. ""We continue to believe that justice was served at the trial,"" a family statement said. ""We are confident that the Court of Appeal will reach the same conclusion."" The case has attracted widespread attention in New Zealand and the UK. Millane's murder shocked and horrified people in both countries, and her family has been praised for their courage and dignity in the face of unimaginable tragedy. The appeal process is likely to be closely watched by both the public and the legal community. The outcome of the appeal could have implications for future cases involving self-defense and the admissibility of evidence of a defendant's sexual history.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Cuts to Education Improvement Grant criticised,"Cuts to Education Improvement Grant Criticized The government's decision to cut funding for the Education Improvement Grant (EIG) has been met with widespread criticism from educators and education experts. The EIG, which provides funding for schools to improve their teaching standards and facilities, will see its budget reduced by 50% over the next three years. Critics argue that the cuts will have a devastating impact on schools, particularly those in disadvantaged areas that rely heavily on EIG funding. They point out that the grant has been instrumental in improving education outcomes in recent years, and that cuts could reverse this progress. A recent study by the National Education Union found that schools that received EIG funding saw significant improvements in pupil achievement, particularly in English and mathematics. The study also found that the grant helped to reduce the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. The cuts to the EIG have been condemned by teaching unions, school leaders, and educational charities. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has warned that the cuts will lead to larger class sizes, fewer teachers, and a reduction in the quality of education provided. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) has also expressed concern about the impact of the cuts. ASCL General Secretary Geoff Barton said: ""These cuts will have a detrimental impact on the ability of schools to provide a high-quality education for all their pupils."" The Children's Commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, has called for the government to reconsider the cuts. She said: ""The EIG is a vital source of funding for schools that are working to improve the life chances of children. Cutting this funding will make it harder for schools to provide the support that children need."" The government has defended the cuts, arguing that they are necessary to reduce public spending. However, critics have pointed out that the government has introduced a number of tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations, and that the cuts to the EIG are therefore a matter of political choice, not economic necessity. The cuts to the EIG have sparked widespread protests from parents, teachers, and pupils. A petition calling on the government to reverse the cuts has gathered over 100,000 signatures. The government has said that it is committed to improving education standards, but critics argue that the cuts to the EIG will make this goal more difficult to achieve.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Demand for food banks drops slightly in Northern Ireland,"Demand for food banks drops slightly in Northern Ireland Demand for food banks in Northern Ireland has fallen slightly in recent months, according to new figures. The Trussell Trust, which operates a network of food banks across the UK, said there were 26,935 three-day emergency food supplies given to people in Northern Ireland between April and September 2022. This is a decrease of 2% compared to the same period last year. However, the charity warned that demand is still significantly higher than before the pandemic. In the first six months of 2019, before the Covid-19 outbreak, the Trussell Trust gave out 14,295 three-day emergency food supplies in Northern Ireland. This means that demand has increased by 88% since the start of the pandemic. The Trussell Trust said the decrease in demand in recent months is likely due to a number of factors, including the end of the Universal Credit uplift and the introduction of a £650 cost of living payment. However, the charity warned that many people are still struggling to afford food and other essentials. ""We are concerned that the cost of living crisis is pushing more and more people into poverty and hunger,"" said David McAuley, the Trussell Trust's Northern Ireland manager. ""We would urge the government to do more to help people on low incomes, including increasing benefits and making it easier for people to access affordable housing.""

The review, which is being led by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will look at how eating disorder services are provided in England. It will also consider how services can be improved. The CQC said the review would be ""thorough and independent"". It said it would ""listen to the experiences of people with eating disorders and their families"". The review comes after a number of high-profile cases of people dying from eating disorders. In 2017, it was reported that at least 1,000 people in England had died from the condition in the previous five years. Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that can lead to death. They are often caused by a combination of psychological, social, and biological factors. People with eating disorders may have a distorted body image, and they may restrict their food intake or exercise excessively. They may also purge their food by vomiting or using laxatives. Eating disorders can have a devastating impact on a person's physical and mental health. They can lead to a range of health problems, including malnutrition, heart problems, and kidney problems. They can also lead to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The CQC review will look at how eating disorder services are provided in England. It will also consider how services can be improved.

Scallop row: UK and France agree 'principles of deal',"The United Kingdom and France have agreed on ""the principles of a deal"" to resolve a dispute over fishing rights in the English Channel, which saw French boats blockading the port of Jersey earlier this year. The agreement was reached after talks between UK Environment Secretary George Eustice and French Europe Minister Clement Beaune in Paris on Thursday. Under the deal, the UK will grant 100 additional licences to French boats to fish in its waters, while France will withdraw its threats to impose sanctions on Jersey. The UK will also review the way it allocates fishing licences in the future, to ensure that they are issued fairly and transparently. The agreement is a significant breakthrough in the long-running dispute between the two countries over fishing rights in the English Channel. The dispute began in May, when the UK government announced that it would not be renewing the licences of some French boats to fish in its waters. The French government responded by threatening to impose sanctions on Jersey, which is a British Crown Dependency. The dispute escalated in June, when French boats blockaded the port of Jersey for several days. The blockade caused significant disruption to Jersey's economy and led to fears of a wider conflict between the UK and France. The agreement reached on Thursday is a welcome step towards resolving the dispute. However, it is important to note that the deal is only in principle at this stage. The details of the deal still need to be worked out, and it is possible that the agreement could still fall apart. Nevertheless, the agreement is a positive sign that the two countries are committed to finding a solution to the dispute. It is hoped that the deal will help to restore trust between the UK and France, and that it will lead to a more stable relationship between the two countries in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Israel enables emergency spy powers,"Coronavirus: Israel enables emergency spy powers Israel has granted its internal security agency sweeping new powers to track the location of people infected with coronavirus, sparking concerns about civil liberties and a lack of oversight. The Shin Bet agency, which normally focuses on counter-terrorism, will now be able to use data collected by mobile phone operators to pinpoint the whereabouts of those infected with Covid-19 and anyone they have come into contact with. The move comes as Israel battles one of the worst outbreaks of the virus in the developed world, with over 11,000 confirmed cases and more than 100 deaths. The government argues that the Shin Bet's capabilities are essential for tracking down those who have been infected and preventing further spread of the virus. ""This is an emergency situation,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We need to take extraordinary measures to protect the public health."" However, critics say the new powers are a disproportionate and unwarranted intrusion into people's privacy. ""This is a dangerous precedent,"" said Hagai El-Ad, executive director of the human rights group B'Tselem. ""It allows the government to track our every move without any judicial oversight."" The Shin Bet has a long and controversial history. It has been accused of using torture and other illegal interrogation techniques against Palestinian suspects. In recent years, the agency has also been accused of spying on Israeli citizens and using its surveillance capabilities to target political opponents of the government. The new powers granted to the Shin Bet will be in place for an initial period of two weeks. However, there are concerns that they could be extended indefinitely if the government declares a state of emergency. The move has sparked protests from civil liberties groups and opposition politicians. They argue that the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to expand its powers and erode democratic freedoms. ""This is not about public health,"" said Tamar Zandberg, leader of the left-wing Meretz party. ""This is about giving the government a blank check to spy on its citizens."" The government has defended the new powers, saying they are necessary to protect the public health. However, it has also pledged to establish an oversight committee to ensure that the Shin Bet does not abuse its new powers. The committee will be made up of members of the Knesset (parliament), the attorney general and representatives from civil society organisations. It will have the power to review the Shin Bet's activities and recommend changes to the legislation. The government has also said that the new powers will only be used for a limited period of time and will be withdrawn once the pandemic is over. However, critics remain sceptical.

H&M stores in South Africa trashed over 'racist' hoodie,"South African protesters have looted and damaged H&M stores across the country over a hoodie with a racially insensitive image and slogan. The global clothing giant has apologized for the garment, which featured a black boy model wearing a hoodie with the words ""Coolest Monkey in the Jungle"" emblazoned across the front. Many saw the image as being racially offensive, and it sparked anger and outrage on social media. In response, protesters have targeted H&M stores in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, and Cape Town. They have smashed windows, looted clothing, and set fire to some stores. The protests have been condemned by both the South African government and H&M. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has called for calm and urged protesters to express their anger peacefully. H&M has also issued a statement apologizing for the hoodie and saying that it has been removed from sale. The company has also announced that it will be donating 1 million euros to organizations working to combat racism. Despite the apology and the donation, the protests have continued. This is a sign of the deep-seated anger that many South Africans feel over the issue of racism. Racism is a serious problem in South Africa. The country has a long history of racial discrimination, and many black South Africans still face prejudice and discrimination today. The ""Coolest Monkey in the Jungle"" hoodie is just one example of the kind of racism that many black South Africans experience on a daily basis. The protests over the hoodie are a sign of the frustration and anger that many black South Africans feel. It is important to remember that racism is not just about individual acts of discrimination. It is also about the systemic racism that exists in many societies. This systemic racism can be seen in the way that black people are often treated differently from white people in areas such as education, employment, and housing. The protests over the H&M hoodie are a reminder that racism is a problem that needs to be addressed on both an individual and a systemic level. We need to work together to create a more just and equitable society for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Boris Johnson's 'union adviser' Oliver Lewis quits after two weeks,"Oliver Lewis, Boris Johnson's newly appointed ""union adviser,"" has resigned after just two weeks in the role. The resignation comes amid a wave of criticism over Lewis's lack of experience in trade unions and his previous comments about workers. Lewis was appointed to the post on July 25, but his tenure has been dogged by controversy. He has been criticized for his lack of experience in trade unions, having previously worked as a journalist and political adviser. He has also been criticized for his previous comments about workers, including a 2013 article in which he described striking workers as ""militant trade unionists"" who were ""holding the country to ransom."" Lewis's resignation is a blow to Johnson, who has made strengthening the union between the UK's four nations a key part of his agenda. It also raises questions about the government's commitment to working with trade unions, which have been critical of Johnson's policies on issues such as Brexit and public sector pay. In a statement, Lewis said that he had decided to resign after ""careful consideration."" He said that he had ""always believed that the government should work closely with trade unions"" and that he had ""hoped to be able to make a positive contribution in this role."" However, he said that he had ""come to the conclusion that I will not be able to do so effectively."" The government has said that it will now begin the process of recruiting a new union adviser. It is unclear who will be appointed to the role, but it is likely that the government will be looking for someone with more experience in trade unions and who is less likely to make controversial comments. Lewis's resignation is the latest in a series of setbacks for Johnson. In recent weeks, he has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his decision to prorogue Parliament, and his relationship with his former aide Dominic Cummings. The resignation of his union adviser will only add to the pressure on Johnson, who is now facing calls to resign from some members of his own party.

China seeks to combat hi-tech crimewave,"China has intensified its crackdown on high-tech crime, as the country grapples with a surge in sophisticated digital offenses. The government has launched a nationwide campaign, deploying cutting-edge technologies and enhancing collaboration among law enforcement agencies. Cybercrimes have become increasingly prevalent in China, fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT). Criminals are exploiting these technologies to commit a wide range of offenses, including identity theft, financial fraud, and intellectual property infringement. In response, the Chinese government has established a dedicated task force, the National Anti-Telecom Network Fraud Center, to coordinate efforts against hi-tech crime. The task force is equipped with advanced analytical tools and a database of known criminal patterns to identify and disrupt these offenses. Law enforcement agencies are also leveraging AI and big data to enhance their crime-fighting capabilities. By analyzing vast amounts of data, they can detect suspicious activities and identify potential targets. Facial recognition systems and surveillance cameras are being deployed to track down suspects and prevent crimes from occurring. The government has also implemented stricter regulations on the sale and use of mobile phone cards, which are often used by criminals to register anonymous accounts and evade detection. Real-name registration and facial recognition are now required when purchasing a new SIM card, making it more difficult for criminals to operate anonymously. Furthermore, China is promoting international cooperation in the fight against hi-tech crime. The country has entered into agreements with other nations to share intelligence, extradite suspects, and develop joint strategies to address emerging threats. Despite these efforts, hi-tech crime remains a significant challenge for China. The rapid pace of technological advancement and the interconnectedness of the global internet provide criminals with new opportunities to commit offenses. The government and law enforcement agencies must continuously adapt and evolve their strategies to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape. Alongside the government's efforts, the Chinese public is also playing a vital role in combating hi-tech crime. Citizens are encouraged to report suspicious activities and to be vigilant about protecting their personal information online. By working together, the government, law enforcement, and the public can create a safer and more secure digital environment for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Crash for cash: Five more guilty over insurance scam,"Crash for Cash: Five More Guilty over Insurance Scam Five more people have been convicted in connection with a multi-million-pound insurance scam that involved staging car crashes. The group, aged between 24 and 48, were found guilty at St Albans Crown Court of conspiracy to commit fraud. The scam, which operated between 2012 and 2014, involved arranging for innocent drivers to be involved in crashes with vehicles driven by members of the gang. The gang would then file fraudulent insurance claims for injuries sustained in the crashes. The investigation into the scam was carried out by the City of London Police's Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED). Detective Inspector Steve Wilson, from IFED, said: ""This was a highly organized and sophisticated scam that defrauded innocent drivers and insurance companies out of millions of pounds."" ""The investigation was complex and challenging, but we were determined to bring those responsible to justice. We hope that today's convictions will send a clear message that insurance fraud will not be tolerated."" The five defendants were arrested in a series of dawn raids in 2016. They were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering. During the trial, the court heard that the gang used a variety of methods to stage the crashes. In some cases, they would drive their vehicles into the back of innocent drivers' cars. In other cases, they would brake suddenly, causing the innocent driver to crash into them. The gang also used cloned license plates and fake insurance policies. This made it difficult for insurance companies to investigate the claims and identify the fraud. The court heard that the gang made more than £5 million from the scam. The money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle, including luxury cars, designer clothes, and holidays abroad. The five defendants were sentenced to a total of 16 years and 9 months in prison. The sentences range from 2 years and 9 months to 5 years and 6 months. Detective Inspector Wilson said: ""These sentences reflect the seriousness of the crimes committed by these defendants. They showed a complete disregard for the welfare of innocent drivers and the integrity of the insurance industry."" ""We will continue to work with our partners to investigate and prosecute insurance fraud. We are determined to protect innocent drivers and insurance companies from this type of criminal activity.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Young Tamils in Sri Lanka 'being held without charge',"In the aftermath of the Sri Lankan civil war, thousands of young Tamils have been detained by the government without charge. Many of these detainees have been held for months or even years, without access to lawyers or their families. The Sri Lankan government claims that these detainees are being held for their own safety, but human rights groups say that they are being held arbitrarily and that their detention is a violation of their human rights. The situation of these young Tamils is a source of great concern for the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. The families of the detainees are desperate for news of their loved ones, and they are calling on the government to release them immediately. The government has been accused of using the arrests of these young Tamils as a way to suppress dissent within the Tamil community. The government has denied these allegations, but the fact that so many young Tamils have been detained without charge has raised concerns about the government's commitment to human rights. The United Nations has called on the Sri Lankan government to release these detainees immediately. The UN has also called on the government to investigate the allegations of arbitrary detention and torture. The government has said that it is committed to human rights, but it has not yet taken any steps to release the detainees or to investigate the allegations of torture. The families of the detainees are desperate for news of their loved ones, and they are calling on the government to take action. The situation of these young Tamils is a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing the Tamil community in Sri Lanka.

Wadsworth, who hailed from Ulverston, Cumbria, joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) in 1943. The ATA was responsible for ferrying aircraft from factories to operational units, a vital role in supporting the war effort. Despite facing prejudice and skepticism as a woman in a male-dominated field, Wadsworth proved to be an exceptional pilot. She flew over 900 aircraft during her time with the ATA, including Spitfires, Hurricanes, and Wellingtons. Her fearless spirit and unwavering determination earned her the admiration of her colleagues. ""She was one of the finest and most courageous pilots I ever flew with,"" said John Hemingway, a fellow ATA pilot. After the war, Wadsworth continued to fly, working as an instructor and test pilot.

Northamptonshire 1930 'blazing car murder': Nine families shortlisted,"In a chilling twist to the unsolved ""blazing car murder"" of 1930, which left the body of an unidentified woman charred beyond recognition, Northamptonshire Police have shortlisted nine families as potential relatives of the victim. The case, which has haunted detectives for decades, took a dramatic turn when a breakthrough in DNA analysis allowed investigators to create a genetic profile of the victim. This profile was then cross-referenced with genetic databases, leading to the identification of nine families with a potential familial connection. Families from across the country, including the West Midlands, Lancashire, and London, have been contacted by police and asked to provide DNA samples for comparison. Investigators believe that the victim may have had links to these areas, as her belongings contained items suggesting she had traveled extensively.

Over the years, there have been numerous theories about the victim's identity, including that she was a runaway teenager, a victim of foul play, or even a spy. However, despite extensive investigations, her true identity has remained elusive. The families who have been shortlisted are now anxiously awaiting the results of the DNA comparisons. They have been told that there is no guarantee that the victim is their relative, but they remain hopeful that this breakthrough could finally provide them with answers after years of uncertainty.

Fonseka political prisoner - former CJ,"In the annals of Sri Lankan history, the saga of Sarath Fonseka, the former Chief of Defence Staff and one-time political prisoner, remains a tale of intrigue, conflict, and societal upheaval. Fonseka's rise to prominence came during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War, where he played a pivotal role in defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. As a venerated military figure, he enjoyed widespread public support and was hailed as a war hero. However, his political aspirations would soon set him on a collision course with the government. In 2010, Fonseka challenged incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the presidential election. The campaign was fiercely contested, with allegations of voter fraud and intimidation. After a narrow defeat, Fonseka found himself the target of political persecution. He was arrested on fabricated charges of conspiring against the government and sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Fonseka's imprisonment sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about the state of democracy in Sri Lanka. The former war hero became a symbol of political oppression, with his supporters organizing protests and demanding his release. After serving his sentence, Fonseka was released in 2012, but he remained under restrictions and surveillance. Following the electoral defeat of Rajapaksa in 2015, Fonseka's political fortunes took a turn. He was elected to parliament in 2016 and joined the government of President Maithripala Sirisena. However, his tenure was marked by controversy, with allegations of corruption and a strained relationship with the ruling party. Fonseka's legacy remains a complex and contested one. His military accomplishments are undeniable, yet his political actions have been divisive. His arrest and imprisonment cast a shadow over Sri Lanka's post-war transition and raised questions about the government's commitment to democratic principles. Today, Fonseka is a vocal critic of the Rajapaksa regime, which has returned to power. He remains a symbol of both the triumph and the tribulations of a nation grappling with its past and present. The story of Sarath Fonseka is a reminder of the often-fragile nature of democracy and the price paid by those who dare to challenge the powerful.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Amazonian groups sue French supermarket chain over deforestation,"Amazonian Groups Sue French Supermarket Chain over Deforestation Indigenous groups from the Amazon rainforest have filed a lawsuit against a French supermarket chain, accusing it of contributing to deforestation in the region. The lawsuit, filed with the French courts, alleges that the supermarket chain has been sourcing products from suppliers linked to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. The lawsuit was filed by the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) and the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). The groups claim that the supermarket chain has been sourcing products such as beef, soy, and palm oil from suppliers who have cleared large areas of rainforest to make way for agriculture. The lawsuit alleges that the supermarket chain has failed to take adequate steps to ensure that its products are not contributing to deforestation. The groups claim that the supermarket chain has not conducted proper due diligence on its suppliers and has not taken steps to reduce the risk of sourcing products from deforested areas. The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to prevent the supermarket chain from sourcing products from suppliers linked to deforestation. The groups are also seeking damages for the environmental damage caused by the deforestation. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal actions brought against companies accused of contributing to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In recent years, a number of companies have been sued by investors, environmental groups, and indigenous communities. The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important ecosystems on Earth. It is home to an estimated 10% of the world's known species and plays a vital role in regulating the global climate. However, the rainforest is under threat from deforestation, which is driven by the demand for commodities such as beef, soy, and palm oil. Deforestation is a major problem in the Amazon rainforest. In 2020, an area of rainforest the size of Portugal was cleared. This deforestation is having a devastating impact on the environment and on the indigenous communities who live in the rainforest. The lawsuit against the supermarket chain is an important step towards holding companies accountable for their role in deforestation. The lawsuit could set a precedent for future legal actions against companies that are linked to deforestation.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Chinese police uncover huge fake jellyfish 'scam',"In a shocking bust, Chinese authorities have uncovered a massive counterfeit jellyfish operation, seizing over 160 tons of artificial jellyfish destined for dinner tables around the country. The operation, which spanned multiple provinces, involved the production and sale of fake jellyfish made from a mixture of industrial gelatin, salt, and alum, posing serious health risks to unsuspecting consumers. Jellyfish, a popular delicacy in China, is harvested from the ocean or farmed in coastal areas. However, the high demand and lucrative prices have led to a surge in counterfeiting, with fraudulent products flooding the market. The fake jellyfish were manufactured in clandestine workshops, where cheap ingredients were combined to create a semblance of the real thing. The artificial jellyfish were then sold to restaurants and seafood markets, often mixed in with genuine jellyfish to maximize profits. The scam was exposed following a tip-off to police in the eastern city of Taizhou, Zhejiang Province. A preliminary investigation revealed a network of suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors involved in the illicit trade. Raids conducted across several provinces uncovered numerous production facilities, where hundreds of workers were busy manufacturing the fake jellyfish. Tons of raw materials and finished products were confiscated, along with equipment used in the production process. Police arrested over 50 suspects, including the alleged mastermind behind the operation. The suspects face charges ranging from fraud to producing and selling harmful food products. The seizure of the fake jellyfish is a major victory for food safety regulators in China, who have been cracking down on counterfeit and adulterated food products in recent years. The case has also highlighted the need for increased vigilance in the seafood industry, where counterfeiting remains a persistent problem. Experts warn that consuming fake jellyfish can have severe consequences for health. Industrial gelatin, a primary component in the counterfeit products, is not intended for human consumption and can contain toxic substances. Alum, another ingredient used in the fake jellyfish, can cause gastrointestinal problems and kidney damage. Consumers are urged to be wary of suspiciously low prices for jellyfish and to purchase seafood from reputable sources. Restaurants and seafood markets should also be vigilant and ensure that their suppliers are legitimate. The authorities are continuing to investigate the case and have vowed to prosecute all those involved in the counterfeit jellyfish operation to the fullest extent of the law.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Cahuzac scandal: Ministers publish wealth details,"Cahuzac scandal: Ministers publish wealth details Amid growing pressure following the Cahuzac scandal, French ministers have published details of their wealth as part of a new transparency drive. The declarations, which include details of assets and income, were published on the government's website on Wednesday. They show that President François Hollande, who has pledged to crack down on tax evasion, has declared assets worth €1.1 million (£900,000). Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has declared assets worth €870,000 (£700,000), while Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici has declared assets worth €1.7 million (£1.3 million). Other ministers have also declared their wealth, including Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who has declared assets worth €3.2 million (£2.5 million), and Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has declared assets worth €1.4 million (£1.1 million). The publication of the ministers' wealth details comes after former Budget Minister Jérôme Cahuzac was forced to resign in March after it emerged that he had hidden millions of euros in a Swiss bank account. The scandal has damaged the government's credibility and led to calls for greater transparency. In response, the government has pledged to introduce a number of measures to crack down on tax evasion, including a new law that will make it easier to prosecute tax fraud. The publication of the ministers' wealth details is a further step in this direction. However, some critics have argued that the declarations do not go far enough and that the government should do more to ensure that all public figures are subject to the same level of scrutiny. The Cahuzac scandal has also raised questions about the extent of tax evasion in France. According to a recent study by the French tax authority, an estimated €60 billion (£48 billion) is lost to tax evasion each year. The government has pledged to crack down on tax evasion and has introduced a number of measures to do so. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be effective in reducing the amount of tax that is lost to evasion.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
How financial crisis in Europe affects the UK's economy,"How Financial Crisis in Europe Affects the UK's Economy The financial crisis that has gripped Europe in recent years has had a significant impact on the UK's economy. The UK is closely linked to the European economy, and so the economic problems in Europe have had a knock-on effect on the UK. One of the main ways that the European financial crisis has affected the UK is through trade. The UK is a major exporter to the European Union, and so when the European economy slows down, the demand for UK goods and services decreases. This has led to a decline in UK exports, which has in turn had a negative impact on the UK's GDP. In addition to the decline in exports, the European financial crisis has also led to a decrease in investment in the UK. Investors are less likely to invest in the UK when the European economy is in turmoil, and this has led to a decline in business investment. This has in turn led to a slowdown in the UK's economic growth. The European financial crisis has also had an impact on the UK's financial sector. The UK's financial sector is heavily exposed to the European economy, and so the problems in Europe have led to increased risk aversion among UK banks. This has made it more difficult for UK businesses to access credit, which has in turn had a negative impact on economic growth. The European financial crisis is a complex issue with a wide range of implications for the UK economy. The UK government has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis, but it is clear that the crisis will continue to have a negative impact on the UK economy for some time to come. What does this mean for the UK economy? The European financial crisis has had a number of negative consequences for the UK economy. These include: A decline in exports A decrease in investment Increased risk aversion among UK banks A slowdown in economic growth The UK government has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis, but it is clear that the crisis will continue to have a negative impact on the UK economy for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Covid: Minister rules out vaccine passports in UK,"Covid: Minister rules out vaccine passports in UK The UK government has ruled out introducing vaccine passports for domestic use, following a review of their potential benefits and risks. Health Minister Sajid Javid said on Monday that the government had ""carefully considered"" the use of vaccine passports, but had concluded that they ""are not a proportionate way"" to tackle the spread of Covid-19. He said that the government was ""confident"" that the current measures in place, such as the vaccination programme and the NHS Covid Pass, were sufficient to ""manage the risks"" of the virus. The decision comes after a six-week consultation on the potential use of vaccine passports, which received more than 150,000 responses. The consultation found that there was ""no consensus"" on the use of vaccine passports, with some people supporting their use and others strongly opposed. The government also considered the potential impact of vaccine passports on civil liberties and the economy, and concluded that they would ""have a significant and disproportionate impact on certain groups in society"". The government's decision has been welcomed by some, who argue that vaccine passports are discriminatory and could lead to a ""two-tier"" society. However, others have expressed disappointment, arguing that vaccine passports could be an effective way to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. The government has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and will ""not hesitate"" to introduce vaccine passports if they become necessary in the future. In the meantime, the government is urging people to get vaccinated and to follow the current Covid-19 restrictions. Analysis: The government's decision not to introduce vaccine passports is a significant development in the UK's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It reflects the government's view that the current measures in place are sufficient to manage the risks of the virus, and that vaccine passports would be disproportionate and discriminatory. The decision is likely to be welcomed by some, but it may also lead to disappointment from others who believe that vaccine passports could be an effective way to reduce the spread of the virus. The government has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and will not hesitate to introduce vaccine passports if they become necessary in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Trade talks 'must include healthcare',"Trade talks 'must include healthcare' Trade deals should not be negotiated without addressing the impact on healthcare systems, a leading health charity has warned.

The charity is calling for trade deals to be transparent and to include clear safeguards to protect public health. It comes as the UK government prepares to negotiate a trade deal with the US. The US has been pushing for changes to the NHS that could lead to higher drug prices and reduced access to healthcare. MSF said it was ""essential"" that the UK government resisted these demands and put the protection of the NHS first. ""Trade deals can have a huge impact on our health, but they are often negotiated in secret, with little or no input from the public,"" said Rachel Kiddell-Monroe, MSF's UK director. ""We are deeply concerned that trade talks could undermine access to affordable medicines and other essential healthcare services. We are calling for trade deals to be transparent and to include clear safeguards to protect public health."" MSF's concerns are echoed by other health organisations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that trade deals can lead to ""higher prices, reduced access to medicines, and weakened health systems"". The European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) has also called for trade deals to be transparent and to include safeguards to protect public health. ""Trade deals are not just about economics. They can have a profound impact on our health and well-being,"" said EPHA director Johanna Hanefeld. ""We need to make sure that trade deals are negotiated in the interests of public health, not just the interests of big business."" The UK government has said it is committed to protecting the NHS in trade talks. However, it has also said that it is willing to consider changes to the NHS if they are ""in the best interests of the UK"". MSF said it was ""essential"" that the UK government resisted US demands to change the NHS. ""The NHS is one of the UK's most cherished institutions.

Megan Pollitt, 19, was found unresponsive in her flat on 10 November 2021. Paramedics were called but were unable to revive her. An inquest into her death at Loughborough Coroners' Court heard that Ms Pollitt had taken a combination of cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. The medical cause of death was given as mixed drug toxicity. The inquest heard that Ms Pollitt had been out with friends on the evening of 9 November. She returned to her flat in the early hours of the morning and took the drugs. Her flatmates found her unresponsive later that day and called for help.

She said she believed the meeting would take place in the coming days. Lady Hermon said she was ""very concerned"" about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland and wanted to discuss her concerns with the Prime Minister. She said: ""I have been very concerned about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland and I want to discuss my concerns with the Prime Minister. ""I believe that the deal that has been negotiated is not in the best interests of Northern Ireland and I want to make sure that the Prime Minister is aware of my concerns."" Lady Hermon is a former member of the Conservative Party, but she resigned from the party in 2019 in protest at its handling of Brexit. She is now an independent member of the House of Lords. The meeting between Lady Hermon and the Prime Minister comes at a time of heightened tensions over the Brexit deal.

Lowest ever winter deaths recorded,"The number of deaths in England during the winter months has fallen to its lowest level on record, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Between December 2022 and March 2023, there were 113,600 deaths in England, which is 15.6% lower than the average number of deaths during the same period over the last five years. The ONS said that the decrease in winter deaths is likely to be due to a number of factors, including the success of the Covid-19 vaccination program and the mild winter weather. Dr. Julie Stanborough, head of mortality analysis at the ONS, said: ""The decrease in winter deaths is good news and is likely to be due to a number of factors, including the success of the Covid-19 vaccination program and the mild winter weather. ""However, it is important to note that the number of deaths in England is still higher than it was before the pandemic, and we are still seeing excess deaths among people aged 65 and over."" The ONS figures also show that the number of deaths from Covid-19 in England during the winter months fell by 86% compared to the previous year. This is likely to be due to the success of the vaccination program, which has reduced the number of people who are becoming seriously ill from the virus. The decrease in winter deaths is a positive sign, but it is important to remember that the number of deaths in England is still higher than it was before the pandemic. We need to continue to take steps to protect ourselves and others from Covid-19, including getting vaccinated and boosted, and following public health advice. Here are some tips for staying healthy during the winter months: Get vaccinated and boosted against Covid-19. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Avoid touching your face. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Stay home if you are feeling unwell. Get regular exercise. Eat a healthy diet. Get enough sleep.

Amazon told to answer Deliveroo deal concerns in five days,"Amazon has been given five days to address competition concerns over its proposed deal to buy food delivery service Deliveroo. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its initial probe had raised issues about the tie-up, which it fears could lead to higher prices, less choice, and reduced innovation in the sector. The CMA said it had ""reasonable grounds for believing that the merger may result in a substantial lessening of competition."" It has now launched a Phase 2 investigation, which will give Amazon and Deliveroo the chance to respond to the concerns. The CMA said its concerns center on the following areas: The combined market share of Amazon and Deliveroo: Amazon is already a major player in the online grocery market, while Deliveroo is one of the UK's leading food delivery services. The CMA is worried that the tie-up could give the combined company too much control over the market, leading to higher prices for consumers. The potential for Amazon to use its data to gain an unfair advantage: Amazon has vast amounts of data on its customers' shopping habits. The CMA is concerned that it could use this data to give Deliveroo an unfair advantage over its rivals, for example, by offering exclusive discounts or promotions to Amazon Prime members. The impact on innovation: The CMA is concerned that the tie-up could stifle innovation in the food delivery sector. Amazon and Deliveroo are both large companies with a strong track record of innovation. However, the CMA is worried that the deal could lead to less competition and less investment in new products and services. The CMA has given Amazon and Deliveroo five working days to submit their responses to these concerns. The companies will then have the opportunity to make further representations before the CMA makes a final decision on whether to block the deal. If the CMA does decide to block the deal, it would be a major setback for Amazon's ambitions in the UK grocery market. It would also be a blow to Deliveroo, which is currently facing intense competition from Uber Eats and other rivals. The CMA's investigation is expected to conclude by the end of the year.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
China quake: Rescue teams blast roads amid aftershocks,"Amid the devastation wrought by Monday's deadly earthquake in China, rescue teams are working tirelessly to reach survivors trapped under the rubble. As aftershocks continue to rattle the region, complicating their efforts, teams are employing a range of techniques, including blasting roads to clear the way for heavy machinery. The 6.8-magnitude quake struck Sichuan province on Monday, killing at least 93 people and injuring hundreds more. The epicenter was in Luding County, a mountainous area home to about 130,000 people. Rescue teams from across the country have been deployed to the affected area, and they are using a variety of equipment to search for survivors. This includes backhoes, excavators, and cranes, as well as search and rescue dogs. In some cases, teams are having to blast roads to clear the way for their vehicles. This is a dangerous operation, as the aftershocks could cause further landslides or building collapses. However, it is necessary to reach the areas where people are trapped. One team that has been using this technique is from the China Earthquake Administration. They have been working in the town of Moxi, which was heavily damaged in the quake. ""We have to be very careful when we blast the roads,"" said team leader Wang Wei. ""The aftershocks could cause the rocks to fall on us. But we have to do it to reach the people who are trapped."" The team has been using explosives to clear a road that leads to a collapsed building. They are hoping to reach a group of people who are believed to be trapped inside. ""We know that there are people trapped in there,"" said Wang. ""We can hear their voices. We are doing everything we can to reach them."" The rescue efforts are being hampered by the aftershocks, which are continuing to shake the region. This is making it difficult for teams to work safely and is also causing further damage to buildings. However, the rescue teams are determined to continue their search for survivors. They are working around the clock, and they are not giving up hope. ""We will not rest until we have found everyone who is trapped,"" said Wang.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

#BBCtrending: The women in Iran taking off the hijab,"#BBCtrending: The women in Iran taking off the hijab In a bold act of defiance against Iran's strict dress code, women across the country are publicly removing their hijabs and posting videos of themselves online. The movement, which has gained momentum in recent weeks, has been met with both support and condemnation. For decades, women in Iran have been required to cover their hair and bodies in public. This law is based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law, but many women have long chafed under its restrictions. In recent years, there have been growing calls for reform, and the new wave of protests is seen as a major escalation of that movement. The protests began in late December when a young woman named Vida Movahed stood on a utility box in Tehran and removed her hijab. She was detained by police and sentenced to a year in prison, but her actions sparked a wider movement. Soon, other women across the country began posting videos of themselves removing their hijabs in public. The protests have been met with a mixed reaction from the Iranian authorities. Some officials have denounced the protesters as ""rioters"" and ""anti-revolutionaries."" Others have taken a more conciliatory tone, saying that the government is listening to the women's concerns. However, there have been reports of arrests and violence against protesters. Despite the risks, the women who are taking off their hijabs are showing no signs of backing down. They say that they are tired of being forced to cover their bodies and want the freedom to choose what they wear. The movement has also resonated with people around the world, who see it as a symbol of the fight for women's rights. The protests in Iran are a reminder that the fight for women's rights is far from over. In many countries, women continue to face discrimination and violence simply because of their gender. The women of Iran are showing the world that they will not be silenced. Their courage is an inspiration to us all. Here are some additional facts about the protests: The protests have spread to at least 30 cities across Iran. Hundreds of women have been arrested. Some protesters have been beaten and tear-gassed by police. The protests have been condemned by the Iranian government, which has accused the protesters of being ""anti-revolutionary."" The protests have been praised by human rights groups, which have called on the Iranian government to respect the women's right to freedom of expression.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Royal Ballet 'in shock' as dancer Sergei Polunin quits,"In a shocking turn of events, the Royal Ballet has announced the sudden departure of principal dancer Sergei Polunin. The news has sent shockwaves through the ballet world, leaving fans and colleagues reeling. Polunin, 28, is widely regarded as one of the most talented ballet dancers of his generation. He joined the Royal Ballet in 2012 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a principal in 2016. He is known for his exceptional technique, emotional intensity, and charismatic stage presence. The Royal Ballet's artistic director, Kevin O'Hare, expressed his deep regret at Polunin's departure. ""Sergei is an extraordinary artist who has brought immense joy to our audiences,"" he said. ""We wish him all the very best for the future."" Polunin has not publicly stated his reasons for leaving the Royal Ballet, but sources close to him have indicated that he has struggled to cope with the intense pressures and demands of the company. He has also been open about his struggles with mental health, which may have played a role in his decision. Polunin's departure is a major loss for the Royal Ballet. He was one of the company's most popular and successful dancers, and his absence will be felt on both the stage and the training grounds. The news has also raised questions about the challenges facing ballet dancers in an increasingly competitive and demanding industry. Polunin's future plans are currently unknown. He has hinted at pursuing other projects outside of ballet, including acting and filmmaking. However, it is also possible that he may return to dance in a different capacity or with a different company.

The spying game: China's global network,"In the shadowy realm of international espionage, China has emerged as a formidable player. Its sprawling global network of spies operates with stealth and precision, seeking to gather intelligence, influence foreign governments, and advance its own geopolitical agenda. China's intelligence apparatus is vast and well-resourced. The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is responsible for internal and external intelligence operations, while the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has a significant intelligence arm known as the General Staff Department. These agencies employ a wide range of methods, from traditional human intelligence to sophisticated cyberwarfare techniques. China's spying network extends far beyond its borders. It has been accused of operating covert operations in over 100 countries, targeting foreign governments, businesses, and dissidents. In the United States, for example, the FBI has investigated numerous cases of Chinese espionage, including the hacking of government computer systems and the theft of trade secrets. One of the key tactics employed by China's spies is the use of ""honeypots"" – individuals who are recruited to provide information or access to sensitive targets. These honeypots can be found in a variety of settings, from academic institutions to diplomatic functions. They are often well-educated and well-connected, making them ideal for gathering information on political, economic, and military matters. China's spying activities have raised concerns among Western governments, who see it as a threat to their national security. In 2018, the United States expelled dozens of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying, and the European Union has also expressed concerns about China's intelligence operations. However, China has defended its spying activities as necessary for protecting its national interests. It argues that other countries, including the United States, also engage in espionage, and that its own activities are no more aggressive or intrusive. The spying game between China and other countries is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. As China's global power and influence grows, so too will the need for it to maintain a robust intelligence network. Western governments will need to remain vigilant and develop effective counterintelligence measures to protect their own national security while also seeking to engage with China in a constructive and cooperative manner.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Egypt arrests: UN condemns detention of human rights advocates,"The United Nations has condemned the detention of human rights advocates in Egypt, calling for their immediate release. Three prominent activists were arrested on 29 November 2022, during a raid on the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), a leading human rights organization. The activists, ECRF director Mohamed Zaree, researcher Haytham Mohamedain, and lawyer Abdelrahman Tarek, were taken to an unknown location and have since been held incommunicado. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, expressed deep concern about the arrests and called for the activists' immediate release. ""The detention of human rights defenders in Egypt is a deeply troubling development,"" Türk said. ""These individuals are playing a vital role in promoting and protecting human rights in the country, and their work should be supported, not criminalized."" The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said that the arrests appear to be part of a broader crackdown on civil society in Egypt. ""We have received reports of numerous other human rights defenders being subjected to arbitrary arrests, detention, and harassment in recent months,"" said OHCHR spokesperson Jeremy Laurence. ""These actions are a violation of Egypt's international obligations and must stop."" The Egyptian government has not commented publicly on the arrests of the three ECRF activists. However, the government has a history of cracking down on dissent and human rights activism. In recent years, the Egyptian government has imprisoned dozens of human rights activists, journalists, and political dissidents. Many of these individuals have been held for months or even years without charge or trial. The crackdown on dissent has been particularly severe since the 2013 military coup that brought President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to power. Sisi has overseen a wide-ranging crackdown on civil society, media, and political opposition. The international community has repeatedly condemned the Egyptian government's crackdown on dissent. In 2021, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling on Egypt to release all political prisoners and to respect the rights of human rights defenders. However, the Egyptian government has ignored the international community's calls for reform. The arrests of the three ECRF activists are a further indication that the government is not willing to tolerate any form of dissent.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Paddy Armstrong in offer to help Guildford Four inquest,"Paddy Armstrong, who spent 15 years in prison for the Guildford pub bombings, is offering to help the inquest into the deaths of his three co-accused. Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, and Carole Richardson died by suicide after their convictions for the 1974 IRA attack were quashed in 1989. Mr Armstrong believes all four convictions were ""fabricated"" and hopes to prevent other families going through the same ordeal. The inquest into the deaths of the ""Guildford Four"" is due to begin in Woking, Surrey, on 2 January. The group was wrongly convicted of the IRA bombings of two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, in 1974, in which five people died and 65 were injured. Mr Armstrong, who was 21 when he was convicted, served 15 years in prison, along with the other three. After their convictions were quashed, the Court of Appeal said the police had lied and fabricated evidence against them. Mr Armstrong, speaking to the BBC, said: ""I am offering my support to the inquest because I believe it is important to find out the truth about what happened to Paul, Gerry and Carole. ""I believe that all four of our convictions were fabricated and I want to help prevent other families going through the same ordeal that my family and the families of Paul, Gerry and Carole have been through."" Mr Armstrong said he had been approached by the coroner's office and asked if he would be willing to give evidence at the inquest. He said he had agreed to do so and would be giving evidence about his own experience of being wrongly convicted and imprisoned. Mr Armstrong said he also hoped to persuade the coroner to allow evidence to be heard about the role of the police in the wrongful convictions. He said: ""I believe that the police have a lot to answer for in this case. ""They lied and fabricated evidence against us and they have never been held to account for their actions. ""I hope that the inquest will allow us to finally get to the truth about what happened and to ensure that something like this never happens again.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
RNLI 'float' advice after 18 deaths off Welsh coast,"RNLI ‘Float’ Advice After 18 Deaths Off Welsh Coast Following the tragic loss of 18 lives in the Bristol Channel in recent weeks, the RNLI has issued an urgent reminder about the importance of wearing a life jacket or buoyancy aid when on or near the water. The warning comes as the organization released statistics showing that there have been 18 accidental drownings in the Welsh coastal region this year, compared to 10 in the same period last year. The RNLI's 'Float to Live' campaign aims to raise awareness of the risks associated with cold water shock and the importance of staying afloat in the event of an accident. Cold water shock is a sudden and potentially fatal involuntary gasp for air caused by the body's reaction to being immersed in cold water. It can lead to drowning even in shallow water. The RNLI's Water Safety Lead, Chris Cousens, said: ""We cannot stress enough how vital it is to wear a life jacket or buoyancy aid when on or near the water, especially during the colder months. Cold water shock is a real and serious risk, and it can affect anyone, regardless of their swimming ability."" The RNLI recommends that anyone going on or near the water should: Wear a life jacket or buoyancy aid that is the correct size and fit. Tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back. Check the weather forecast and tide times before you set off. Carry a means of communication, such as a mobile phone in a waterproof case. Cousens added: ""We urge everyone to take heed of our advice and to always put safety first. By following these simple steps, we can all help to reduce the risk of drowning and save lives."" The RNLI also offers free Float to Live leaflets and resources for anyone who wants to learn more about water safety. These can be downloaded from the RNLI website or obtained from RNLI lifeboat stations. Remember, if you see someone in trouble in the water, call 999 or 112 immediately.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Hong Kong: 'Secession' arrests after Chinese University protest,"Hong Kong police have arrested eight people for ""secession"" following a protest at the city's Chinese University. The arrests came after protesters gathered on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of a similar demonstration last year that turned violent. Police said the eight people were arrested for displaying flags and banners calling for Hong Kong's independence. They were also accused of chanting slogans that promoted secession. The arrests are the latest in a series of crackdowns on dissent in Hong Kong, which has been wracked by anti-government protests for the past year. The protests began in June 2019 in response to a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the protests have continued, with demonstrators calling for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong. The Chinese government has condemned the protests and accused foreign powers of煽动 them. The Hong Kong government has also taken a hard line against the demonstrations, arresting hundreds of people and using tear gas, water cannon, and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. The arrests of the eight people for ""secession"" are a further sign of the government's determination to crack down on dissent. The charge of secession carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The arrests have been condemned by human rights groups, who say they are a violation of the right to freedom of expression. The United States has also expressed concern about the arrests, saying they ""undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms."" The arrests are likely to further escalate tensions in Hong Kong, which is already facing its worst political crisis in decades.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Article 50 would 'change devolution', Welsh Government says","Article 50 would 'change devolution', Welsh Government says The Welsh Government has said triggering Article 50 to start the process of the UK leaving the European Union would ""change the devolution settlement"" and could lead to powers being returned to Westminster. In a paper published on Tuesday, the government said it was ""essential"" that the UK government involved the devolved administrations in the negotiations with the EU. It also said that the Welsh Government should be given a ""stand alone seat"" at the negotiating table. The paper, which was sent to the UK government, said that triggering Article 50 without the consent of the devolved administrations would be ""a breach of the spirit of devolution"". It said that the UK government had a ""duty"" to consult with the devolved administrations before triggering Article 50, and that the Welsh Government should be given a ""seat at the table"" in the negotiations. The paper also said that the Welsh Government should be given a ""stand alone seat"" at the negotiating table, rather than being represented by the UK government. The Welsh Government said that it was ""committed to working with the UK government to secure the best possible outcome for Wales"" in the Brexit negotiations. However, it said that it was ""essential"" that the UK government involved the devolved administrations in the negotiations, and that the Welsh Government should be given a ""stand alone seat"" at the negotiating table. The UK government has said that it will consult with the devolved administrations before triggering Article 50. However, it has not yet said whether the Welsh Government will be given a ""stand alone seat"" at the negotiating table. The Welsh Government's paper is likely to add to the pressure on the UK government to involve the devolved administrations in the Brexit negotiations. The Scottish and Northern Irish governments have also said that they should be involved in the negotiations. If the UK government does not involve the devolved administrations in the negotiations, it could lead to a constitutional crisis. The devolved administrations could challenge the UK government's right to trigger Article 50 without their consent. This could lead to a legal battle that could delay or even derail the Brexit process.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
MP Elfyn Llwyd criticises care for military veterans,"MP Elfyn Llwyd Criticises Care for Military Veterans Liberal Democrat MP Elfyn Llwyd has expressed concern over the care and support provided to military veterans in the United Kingdom. Speaking in the House of Commons, Llwyd highlighted several areas where he believes improvements are needed. One of Llwyd's main criticisms is the lack of consistent standards in the provision of mental health care for veterans. He pointed to a recent report by the Royal British Legion that found that one in four veterans had been diagnosed with a mental health condition, but that many were struggling to access the treatment they needed. ""It is simply unacceptable that our veterans, who have served our country with distinction, are being let down by the system when they need it most,"" said Llwyd. ""We must do better to ensure that they have access to the timely and appropriate mental health care they deserve."" Llwyd also raised concerns about the lack of adequate housing for veterans. He noted that many veterans are facing homelessness or living in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation. ""It is a disgrace that our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for our country, are being forced to live in such conditions,"" said Llwyd. ""We need to invest more in providing affordable and accessible housing for these individuals."" Additionally, Llwyd criticized the government's approach to supporting veterans who are struggling with physical disabilities. He argued that the current system is too bureaucratic and that it often takes too long for veterans to receive the benefits and assistance they are entitled to. ""Our veterans deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,"" said Llwyd. ""We need to streamline the system and make it easier for them to access the support they need. We must also ensure that the benefits and services they receive are commensurate with the sacrifices they have made."" Llwyd concluded his speech by calling on the government to take immediate action to address the concerns he had raised. ""Our veterans have served our country with honor and distinction,"" said Llwyd. ""It is our duty to ensure that they are given the care, support, and respect they deserve. We must not fail them.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Living with children 'no increased risk',"Living with Children Does Not Increase COVID-19 Risk A new study has found that living with children does not increase the risk of catching COVID-19. The research, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at data from over 2,000 households in the United States. The study found that the risk of catching COVID-19 was the same for people who lived with children and those who did not. This was true even for people who lived with children under the age of 18, who are more likely to spread the virus. The study also found that children were less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 than adults. This is likely because children have a stronger immune system than adults. The findings of this study are reassuring for parents who are concerned about the risk of their children catching COVID-19. The study shows that living with children does not increase the risk of catching the virus, and that children are less likely to be hospitalized or die from the virus than adults. However, it is important to note that children can still spread the virus to others, so it is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. These precautions include: Washing your hands frequently Wearing a mask in public places Staying home if you are sick Avoiding large gatherings Getting vaccinated By following these precautions, you can help protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19. What does this mean for schools? The findings of this study suggest that schools can safely reopen without increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, it is important for schools to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as: Requiring students and staff to wear masks Ensuring that there is adequate ventilation in classrooms Encouraging students and staff to stay home if they are sick Offering remote learning options for students who are at high risk for severe illness By taking these precautions, schools can help to protect students and staff from COVID-19.

Queen's Speech outlines new Scottish Parliament powers,"The Queen's Speech has outlined plans to give the Scottish Parliament new powers over welfare, justice, and policing. The speech, which was delivered by Prince Charles on behalf of the Queen, said that the government would introduce legislation to ""devolve further powers to the Scottish Parliament"". The move is part of the UK government's ongoing commitment to devolution, which has seen the Scottish Parliament given increasing powers over a range of areas in recent years. The new powers would give the Scottish Parliament control over welfare benefits, including the ability to set its own rates and eligibility criteria. It would also give the parliament control over criminal justice and policing, including the ability to set its own laws on these matters. The Scottish government has welcomed the announcement, saying that it is a ""significant step forward"" for devolution. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This is a historic day for Scotland. The people of Scotland have long demanded more powers over their own affairs, and today's announcement is a vindication of that demand."" However, the announcement has been criticized by some opposition politicians, who say that it will lead to a ""two-tier"" system of government in the UK. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This is a dangerous and divisive move that will create a two-tier system of government in the UK. It will lead to a situation where people in Scotland are treated differently to people in the rest of the UK."" The UK government has said that it is confident that the new powers will be used responsibly by the Scottish Parliament. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""I am confident that the Scottish Parliament will use these new powers responsibly and in the best interests of the people of Scotland.""

Secret Service Colombia scandal prompts new rules,"Amidst the escalating scandal surrounding Colombia's Secret Service, the government has swiftly implemented new regulations to restore public trust and prevent similar controversies in the future. The scandal, which sent shockwaves through the nation, involved allegations of misconduct, abuse of power, and illegal activities within the elite intelligence agency. Disturbing reports emerged of unauthorized surveillance, illegal wiretapping, and even assassination plots. In response to the public outcry, President Gustavo Petro wasted no time in taking action. He ordered an immediate investigation, suspended several high-ranking officials, and vowed to implement sweeping reforms within the Secret Service. Among the new regulations announced by the government are: Stricter recruitment and vetting procedures: Potential recruits will undergo more rigorous background checks and psychological evaluations to ensure their suitability for service. Enhanced oversight and accountability: A new civilian oversight board, composed of independent experts, will monitor the agency's activities and hold it accountable to the public. Clearer guidelines for surveillance: The use of surveillance powers will be limited to specific, authorized purposes and subject to judicial review. Whistleblower protections: Employees who report wrongdoing within the agency will be protected from retaliation and their identities will remain confidential. Regular audits and inspections: External auditors and inspectors will conduct regular reviews of the Secret Service's operations to ensure compliance with the new regulations. In addition to these measures, the government emphasized the importance of cultural change within the agency. Training and education programs will focus on ethics, accountability, and respect for the rule of law.

Ecuador curbs Assange's internet to halt US election 'interference',"Ecuador has restricted Julian Assange's internet access at its London embassy, in a bid to prevent him from interfering in the upcoming US election. The move comes after Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, released a series of emails that appeared to show that Hillary Clinton's campaign had colluded with the Democratic National Committee to undermine her rival, Bernie Sanders, during the Democratic primary. The emails were widely seen as damaging to Clinton's campaign, and some believe that they may have contributed to her defeat in the election. Ecuador's decision to restrict Assange's internet access has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the move, arguing that it is necessary to prevent Assange from interfering in the US election. Others have criticized the decision, arguing that it is a violation of Assange's freedom of speech. Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012, when he was granted asylum after being charged with sexual assault in Sweden. He has been accused of rape by two women, but he denies the charges. Assange has been a controversial figure since he founded WikiLeaks in 2006. The website has published a number of classified documents, including the US military's ""Collateral Murder"" video, which showed American soldiers killing Iraqi civilians. Assange has argued that his work is in the public interest, and that he is a whistleblower who has exposed government wrongdoing. However, his critics have accused him of being a traitor who has put lives at risk. The US government has been trying to extradite Assange to face charges ever since he published the ""Collateral Murder"" video. However, Ecuador has refused to extradite him, arguing that he would not receive a fair trial in the US. It is unclear how long Assange will remain in the Ecuadorian embassy. However, it is clear that his presence there is a source of tension between Ecuador and the US.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The strike, which began at 9pm on Monday, is over a dispute with London Underground (LU) over pay and working conditions. The RMT union, which represents the drivers, says LU has failed to address its concerns over pay, pensions and working conditions. LU says it has made a ""fair and reasonable"" offer to the RMT, but the union has rejected it. The strike is expected to cause widespread disruption to services on the Central Line, which is one of London's busiest Underground lines. Passengers are being advised to avoid using the Central Line if possible and to seek alternative routes. LU is running a reduced service on the Central Line, but there are severe delays and cancellations. The RMT is urging LU to return to talks and resolve the dispute. LU says it is committed to finding a resolution to the dispute and is urging the RMT to call off the strike. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial action by London Underground staff in recent months. In August, members of the RMT and TSSA unions staged a 24-hour strike on the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines. In September, members of the RMT and Aslef unions staged a 24-hour strike on the Northern and Victoria lines. LU says it is committed to working with the unions to resolve the ongoing disputes.

High Streets hit as shop vacancy rate worst since 2015,"High Streets Hit Hard as Shop Vacancy Rate Soars The number of empty shops on Britain's high streets has reached its highest level since 2015, as the retail sector continues to struggle. According to new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the vacancy rate in England and Wales stands at 14.1%. This is up from 13.8% in the previous quarter and is the highest level since the BRC began collecting data in 2015. The news comes as a blow to town and city centers, which are already struggling with the rise of online shopping and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BRC said that the vacancy rate is being driven by a number of factors, including the ""unprecedented"" rise in energy costs, which is forcing many businesses to close. ""The retail industry is facing a perfect storm of rising costs, falling consumer confidence, and a shift to online shopping,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC. ""This is putting immense pressure on businesses, and many are simply unable to survive."" The BRC is calling on the government to provide more support to retailers, including measures to help them reduce their energy bills. ""The government needs to act now to help businesses survive this crisis,"" said Dickinson. ""Without further support, we could see even more shops closing and more jobs being lost."" The news of the rising vacancy rate has also been met with concern by local council leaders. ""This is a worrying trend that could have a devastating impact on our town centers,"" said James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association.

Venezuela political prisoners 'revolt' at Caracas jail,"Venezuela Political Prisoners 'Revolt' at Caracas Jail At least 14 political prisoners have taken control of a wing of a jail in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, demanding their immediate release. The prisoners, who were detained during anti-government protests in recent years, seized control of a corridor in the El Helicoide jail on Monday. They have barricaded themselves inside and are refusing to leave until their demands are met. The prisoners are demanding the release of all political prisoners in Venezuela, as well as an end to the persecution of dissent. They are also calling for an independent investigation into the deaths of several political prisoners in recent years. The Venezuelan government has not yet commented on the situation, but security forces have been deployed around the jail. The political prisoners' revolt is the latest sign of growing unrest in Venezuela, which is facing a severe economic and political crisis. The country has been plagued by shortages of food and medicine, and inflation has soared to over 1 million percent. The government of President Nicolás Maduro has been accused of corruption and human rights abuses, and there have been widespread protests against his rule. The prisoners' revolt comes just days after the United Nations released a report accusing the Venezuelan government of committing crimes against humanity. The report found that the government had carried out arbitrary detentions, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The UN report has put further pressure on the Maduro government, which is already facing sanctions from the United States and other countries. It is unclear how the prisoners' revolt will end, but it is a sign of the growing desperation and anger among Venezuelans. The prisoners' demands are unlikely to be met by the government, which has shown no willingness to compromise. This could lead to a prolonged standoff, or even a violent confrontation.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Justene Reece: Police failed to link stalking reports before death,"Justine Reece, 21, was stalked and harassed by a man she had previously dated, David O'Dowd, for months before her death. Despite reporting O'Dowd's behavior to the police on multiple occasions, officers failed to link the reports together and take appropriate action. Justine's family has said that they believe that if the police had taken her reports more seriously, she would still be alive today. O'Dowd was eventually arrested and charged with Justine's murder, but he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Justine's case has highlighted the need for police to take stalking and harassment more seriously and to improve their response to reports of such crimes. In the wake of Justine's death, her family has set up a foundation in her name to raise awareness of stalking and harassment and to support victims of these crimes. The foundation's website states that ""Justine's legacy will be to ensure that no other family has to suffer the pain and loss that we have."" Justine's case is not an isolated one. In the UK, there are an estimated 1.5 million stalking victims each year. Stalking can have a devastating impact on victims' lives, causing them to feel scared, anxious, and isolated. In many cases, stalking victims are reluctant to report their experiences to the police, fearing that they will not be taken seriously or that their reports will not be acted upon. However, it is important to remember that stalking is a crime and that victims should report it to the police. The police have a duty to investigate reports of stalking and to take appropriate action to protect victims. If you are being stalked, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself: Keep a record of all incidents of stalking, including dates, times, and details of what happened. Report the stalking to the police. Tell your friends and family about what is happening. Get a restraining order against the stalker. Consider getting a panic alarm or personal safety device.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Aldi overtakes Co-op to become UK's fifth largest grocer,"Aldi overtakes Co-op to become UK's fifth largest grocer German discounter Aldi has overtaken The Co-op to become the UK's fifth largest grocer, according to the latest market share figures. Aldi's market share has grown to 9.3%, up from 8.9% a year ago, while The Co-op's has fallen to 6.3%, down from 6.6%. The figures, from Kantar Worldpanel, show that Aldi is now the fastest-growing grocer in the UK, with sales up by 18.7% over the past year. The Co-op's sales have fallen by 1.1% over the same period. Aldi's success is being driven by its low prices and its focus on own-brand products. The discounter has been expanding rapidly in recent years, opening new stores and increasing its range of products. The Co-op, on the other hand, has been struggling to compete with the discounters. The grocer has been losing market share for several years and has recently closed a number of stores. The change in market share between Aldi and The Co-op is a significant development in the UK grocery market. It shows that the discounters are continuing to grow in popularity, while the traditional grocers are struggling to compete. Aldi's success is also a sign of the growing importance of value for money for UK consumers. Shoppers are increasingly looking for ways to save money on their grocery bills, and Aldi's low prices are proving to be attractive. The Co-op's decline is a concern for the grocer. The Co-op is a major employer in the UK and it plays an important role in many local communities. However, the grocer needs to find a way to compete with the discounters if it wants to survive. One possible way for The Co-op to compete with the discounters would be to focus on its own-brand products. The Co-op has a strong range of own-brand products, which are often of good quality and competitively priced. Another option for The Co-op would be to offer more convenience to shoppers. The Co-op has a large network of stores, many of which are located in convenient locations. The grocer could focus on offering more services to shoppers, such as online shopping and home delivery. It remains to be seen whether The Co-op can find a way to compete with the discounters. However, the grocer's decline is a reminder of the challenges facing traditional grocers in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Inca success in Peruvian Andes 'thanks to llama dung',"Inca Success in Peruvian Andes 'Thanks to Llama Dung' In the unforgiving environment of the Peruvian Andes, the Incas flourished for centuries thanks in part to their clever use of llama dung. This remarkable civilization built vast cities, developed a complex agricultural system, and created stunning works of art, all while relying on the humble llama for survival. Llama dung served as a vital fuel source for the Incas. The high altitude and harsh conditions made it difficult to find firewood, but llama dung burned cleanly and efficiently. It was used to cook food, warm homes, and light public spaces. The Incas even developed a specialized type of stove, known as a ""fogón,"" that was designed to burn llama dung optimally. But llama dung's value extended far beyond fuel. The Incas discovered that it was also an excellent fertilizer. When mixed with soil, llama dung provided essential nutrients for crops. This allowed the Incas to cultivate a wide variety of plants at high altitudes, where farming would otherwise have been impossible. Inca farmers used llama dung to build raised fields, known as ""andenes."" These elevated platforms created a microclimate that was more conducive to plant growth. By terracing the slopes of the Andes, the Incas were able to maximize agricultural productivity and feed their growing population. Llama dung also played a role in Inca construction. The Incas used it to make mortar, which was used to build walls, temples, and palaces. The dung was mixed with clay and other materials to create a strong and durable adhesive. This enabled the Incas to build impressive structures that have withstood the test of time. In addition to its practical applications, llama dung also had cultural significance for the Incas. It was used in religious ceremonies and festivals. The smoke from burning llama dung was believed to have purifying properties. It was also used to create ceremonial fires, which were used to communicate with the gods. The Inca civilization is a testament to the ingenuity and adaptability of human societies. By harnessing the unique properties of llama dung, the Incas were able to thrive in a challenging environment. Their success serves as a reminder of the importance of sustainable practices and the potential for innovation in even the most unlikely of sources.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Ethiopia Tigray crisis: Fear of mass starvation,"In the war-torn Tigray region of Ethiopia, the haunting specter of mass starvation looms large. The conflict has ravaged the region, leaving its people teetering on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. Food supplies have dwindled to alarming levels, and access to basic necessities like clean water and healthcare has been severely compromised. Fields lie fallow, and livestock has been decimated, leaving countless families destitute and facing unimaginable hardship. The United Nations has repeatedly warned of the dire situation, estimating that over 5 million people in Tigray are in urgent need of food assistance. However, aid deliveries have been repeatedly blocked by warring parties, exacerbating the suffering of civilians. The plight of the people of Tigray is particularly harrowing. Many have been displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in overcrowded camps where disease and malnutrition run rampant. Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis, with stunted growth and an increased vulnerability to preventable diseases. International aid agencies are working tirelessly to provide life-saving assistance, but their efforts are severely hampered by the ongoing conflict. Humanitarian corridors have been repeatedly violated, and aid workers have been targeted, putting their own lives at risk. The consequences of mass starvation in Tigray would be devastating. It would not only result in the loss of countless lives but also destabilize the entire region. The World Food Program has warned that if aid is not delivered urgently, the Tigray crisis could become one of the worst famines in recent history. The international community must act now to avert this impending catastrophe. Pressure must be exerted on the warring parties to allow unfettered access for humanitarian assistance. Aid agencies must be given the necessary protection to safely deliver life-saving supplies to those in desperate need. The people of Tigray cannot be abandoned to their fate. Their lives and the future of their region hang in the balance. Immediate and decisive action is required to prevent a tragedy of unimaginable proportions.

Saudi Arabia profile - overview,"Saudi Arabia: A Land of Contrasts Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its holiest sites, is a land of ancient traditions and modern ambitions. Spanning a vast and arid desert landscape, the kingdom is an enigma, a land of paradoxes and contradictions. With its vast oil reserves and an authoritarian monarchy, Saudi Arabia is a wealthy nation and a major player on the world stage. Yet, it also faces significant social and economic challenges, including high youth unemployment and a strict adherence to Islamic law. Geography and Population: Saudi Arabia occupies the vast Arabian Peninsula, bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Yemen to the south, and Oman to the southeast. With a land area of over 2 million square kilometers, it is the largest country in the Middle East and the fifth largest in the world. The population of Saudi Arabia is estimated to be around 36 million, including a large expatriate workforce. The majority of the population are Muslims, with a small Christian minority. The official language is Arabic, and the capital city is Riyadh. History and Politics: Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who unified the various tribes of the Arabian Peninsula under a single monarchy. The kingdom has been ruled by the House of Saud ever since. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, with the king wielding ultimate authority over all aspects of government and society. The king is advised by a Council of Ministers, appointed by him. There is no elected parliament or political parties. Economy: Saudi Arabia has one of the largest and most diversified economies in the Middle East. However, it is heavily dependent on oil, which accounts for the majority of its exports and government revenue. In recent years, the government has implemented reforms to reduce its reliance on oil and promote economic diversification. These include investments in renewable energy, tourism, and other non-oil sectors. Culture and Society: Saudi Arabia is a deeply conservative society, shaped by Islamic law and tradition. Women face significant restrictions, including legal limitations on their movement, education, and employment. However, there have been some signs of social liberalization in recent years. In 2018, women were granted the right to drive, and there have been increased efforts to promote female empowerment. Challenges and Future Outlook: Saudi Arabia faces a number of challenges, including high youth unemployment, income inequality, and environmental degradation. The country also faces geopolitical risks, including the ongoing conflict in Yemen and tensions with Iran. The future of Saudi Arabia depends on its ability to address these challenges and adapt to a changing global economy. The kingdom's ambitious Vision 2030 plan aims to diversify the economy, create new jobs, and improve the quality of life for its citizens. The success of this plan will shape the destiny of Saudi Arabia for decades to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pangbourne sprays to kill oak processionary caterpillar 'dangerous',"Pangbourne sprays to kill oak processionary caterpillar 'dangerous' Residents in Pangbourne have been warned not to touch a dangerous spray being used to kill oak processionary caterpillars in the area. The caterpillars, which can cause skin rashes and respiratory problems, have been found in trees in the village and the council has begun spraying to eradicate them. However, the spray, which contains the insecticide deltamethrin, can also be harmful to humans and animals if it is ingested or inhaled. Pangbourne Parish Council has warned residents to keep children and pets away from the sprayed areas and to wear protective clothing if they have to go near them. The council has also advised residents to wash any clothes that have come into contact with the spray and to seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms such as skin irritation, nausea, or vomiting. Deltamethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide that is commonly used to control pests in agriculture and public health. It is also used in some household products, such as flea and tick treatments for pets. Deltamethrin can cause a range of health problems in humans, including skin irritation, eye irritation, respiratory problems, and neurological problems. In severe cases, it can be fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified deltamethrin as a moderately hazardous pesticide. However, the UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has concluded that deltamethrin is safe to use when used according to the instructions on the product label. The HSE advises users to wear protective clothing and equipment when using deltamethrin, to avoid contact with skin and eyes, and to wash their hands thoroughly after use. The council has said that it is using the spray in accordance with the HSE's guidelines and that it is taking all necessary precautions to protect the public. However, some residents have expressed concerns about the use of the spray, particularly in areas where children and pets are likely to be present. The council has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and will take further action if necessary to protect the public. In the meantime, residents are advised to follow the council's advice and to avoid contact with the sprayed areas.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Kurdish PKK rebels 'begin leaving Turkey' after truce,"Kurdish PKK rebels begin leaving Turkey after truce Kurdish PKK rebels have begun to withdraw from Turkey under a historic peace deal aimed at ending decades of bloodshed. The first group of around 200 fighters crossed into northern Iraq on Wednesday, under the supervision of international monitors. The move is part of a deal agreed in March between the Turkish government and the PKK, which has been fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish population. The PKK has agreed to withdraw all its fighters from Turkey by the end of the year, and to disarm. In return, the Turkish government has agreed to grant Kurds greater cultural and political rights. The withdrawal is a major step forward in the peace process, but it is not without its risks. The PKK has a long history of breaking ceasefires, and there are fears that the withdrawal could lead to renewed violence. However, both the Turkish government and the PKK are committed to the peace process, and they are confident that it can succeed. The withdrawal is being overseen by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Turkish government, and international monitors. The monitors are from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE monitors will be responsible for verifying that the PKK fighters are withdrawing from Turkey and that they are disarming. They will also be responsible for monitoring the security situation in the areas from which the PKK fighters are withdrawing. The withdrawal is expected to take several months to complete. Once it is complete, the PKK will have withdrawn all of its fighters from Turkey for the first time in more than 30 years. The peace process between the Turkish government and the PKK has been ongoing for several years. It has been a difficult process, but it has made significant progress in recent months. The withdrawal of the PKK fighters from Turkey is a major step forward in the peace process, and it is a sign that both sides are committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Warrior women of Eigg and other tales from Small Isles,"In the mystical realm of the Small Isles, off the west coast of Scotland, a tapestry of tales unfolds, where warrior women and legendary figures dance through the mists of time. Among these captivating narratives, the saga of the fierce women of Eigg stands tall. According to ancient Gaelic lore, the Isle of Eigg was once home to a formidable band of female warriors known as the ""Daughters of Eigg."" These warrior women, led by the legendary Scaithach, were renowned for their exceptional skills in combat and their unwavering courage. In one tale, the Daughters of Eigg faced an invading force from the Isle of Skye. With bows and arrows in hand, they defended their homeland with fierce determination. Their arrows flew with deadly precision, raining upon the enemy from the hillsides. The invaders, overwhelmed by the women's tenacity, were forced to retreat. Another tale tells of how Scaithach trained the young Celtic hero Cú Chulainn in the arts of warfare. The Daughters of Eigg imparted upon him the secrets of swordsmanship, archery, and the deadly ""sling bullet."" Under their tutelage, Cú Chulainn became one of the greatest warriors in Irish mythology. The legacy of the warrior women of Eigg lives on in the island's folklore and archaeological record. The remains of an ancient fort, perched on a rugged clifftop, are believed to have been the stronghold of Scaithach and her formidable daughters. Beyond Eigg, the other Small Isles hold their own enchanting stories. On the Isle of Muck, the legend of ""The Red Lady of Muck"" persists. She is said to haunt the island's ancient ruins, a spectral figure guarding hidden treasures and secrets. On the Isle of Rùm, tales of a giant race of people, known as the ""Fomorians,"" are still whispered among locals. These mythical beings are said to have ruled the island in prehistoric times, leaving behind enigmatic stone structures and legends of their immense strength. As the sun sets over the Small Isles, casting long shadows across the landscape, the echoes of warrior women, legendary figures, and otherworldly tales continue to reverberate. These islands hold within their embrace a rich seam of history, myth, and folklore, inviting us to delve into a world where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Evan Lloyd Evans jailed after 'appalling' horses case,"Evan Lloyd Evans, 39, of Glandyfi, near Machynlleth, Powys, admitted 15 offences relating to the poor treatment of animals. Evans had been warned previously about the poor condition of the animals, and an RSPCA inspector found horses in ""appalling"" condition during a visit in March 2021. Evans was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison and was banned from keeping equines for life. The RSPCA said 18 horses were removed from the land, with five needing immediate veterinary treatment. Prosecutor Helen Tench said witnesses described the condition of the land as ""a quagmire"". She said Evans had been given advice from vets and the RSPCA on how to improve the horses' condition but had failed to act on it. ""The photographs show the appalling condition that these horses were kept in,"" Ms Tench said. ""They were standing in deep mud and their hooves were overgrown."" Defending, Nia Lloyd said her client had not intended to cause the animals suffering. She said he had taken on more horses than he could cope with and had been struggling to pay for their feed and care. ""He is not a cruel man and he is deeply remorseful for any suffering caused,"" Ms Lloyd said. Sentencing, Judge Timothy Petts said the case was ""a sorry tale of neglect"". He said Evans had ""failed abjectly"" to meet the needs of the animals in his care. ""It's clear you were totally out of your depth,"" Judge Petts said. ""You were keeping far too many horses and were simply unable to cope."" The judge said the prison sentence and ban on keeping horses were necessary to protect animals from further suffering. Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said: ""This is one of the worst cases of neglect I have ever seen. ""The horses were in appalling condition and were suffering unnecessarily. ""We are pleased that Evans has been banned from keeping horses for life and hope that this sends out a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

"Rural communities being ignored and underrated, say peers","Amidst the bustling metropolises and technological advancements, rural communities often find themselves overlooked and undervalued. Yet, the vital role they play in shaping our society and economy cannot be understated. A recent report from the House of Lords has highlighted the urgent need to address the growing disparity between urban and rural areas. Rural communities face unique challenges that are often overlooked by policymakers. The decline of traditional industries, such as farming and mining, has led to economic stagnation in many regions. Lack of access to essential services, including healthcare, education, and transportation, further compounds the challenges faced by rural residents. The report emphasizes that the neglect of rural communities has profound consequences not only for those living in these areas but for the nation as a whole. Rural areas provide vital ecosystem services, such as clean air and water, that benefit everyone. They also serve as important centers for food production, tourism, and cultural heritage. Furthermore, rural communities play a crucial role in maintaining social cohesion and stability. The close-knit nature of these communities fosters strong bonds and a sense of belonging, which are essential for a thriving society. Ignoring the needs of rural communities not only undermines their well-being but also weakens the fabric of our nation. The report calls for a comprehensive approach to tackling the challenges facing rural communities. This includes investing in infrastructure, such as broadband internet and transportation networks, to improve connectivity and economic opportunities. It also emphasizes the need for tailored support for businesses and industries that are specific to rural areas. Moreover, the report highlights the importance of empowering rural communities to have a voice in decision-making that affects them. This can be achieved through greater representation in government and local authorities, as well as the establishment of community-led organizations that can advocate for their needs. By recognizing the value of rural communities and addressing the challenges they face, we can create a more balanced and prosperous society. The neglect of rural areas is a national issue that requires urgent attention. It is time for policymakers and all stakeholders to prioritize the needs of these communities and ensure that they are given the opportunities they deserve to thrive and contribute to the well-being of our nation.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Tories would scrap stamp duty on £250,000 homes","The Conservative Party has pledged to scrap stamp duty on all homes worth up to £250,000 in England and Northern Ireland if it wins the next general election. The policy, which would come into effect from April 2025, is designed to help first-time buyers and those moving up the property ladder. Stamp duty is a tax on the purchase of property in England and Northern Ireland. The amount of tax you pay depends on the value of the property and whether you are a first-time buyer. First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on properties up to £300,000, and 5% on the portion of the property price between £300,000 and £500,000. Under the Conservative Party's proposals, first-time buyers would pay no stamp duty on properties up to £250,000, and 5% on the portion of the property price between £250,000 and £500,000. This would mean that first-time buyers would save up to £2,500 on the purchase of a £250,000 home. The Conservative Party has also pledged to increase the threshold at which people start paying stamp duty on their main home from £125,000 to £250,000. This would mean that people would not have to pay any stamp duty on the first £250,000 of their home's value, regardless of whether they were a first-time buyer or not. The Conservative Party says that its stamp duty cuts would help to boost the housing market and make it easier for people to buy a home. The policy has been welcomed by the property industry, but critics have argued that it will benefit wealthy homeowners more than first-time buyers. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to scrap stamp duty for first-time buyers on all homes under £500,000, while Labour has pledged to scrap stamp duty for all first-time buyers on homes under £250,000.

Protests against train fare rises held at more than 100 stations,"In a widespread display of discontent, protesters took to over 100 railway stations across the United Kingdom on Saturday to voice their opposition to impending train fare increases. The demonstrations, organized by the pressure group Action for Rail, were intended to send a clear message to the government and train operating companies that the proposed fare hikes are unacceptable. The protests, which saw participation from commuters, trade unions, and political organizations, were marked by a lively atmosphere. At London's Euston station, hundreds of demonstrators gathered, waving placards and chanting slogans such as ""Stop the fare rises"" and ""Rail for all, not just the rich."" Similar scenes unfolded at stations in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, among others. The planned fare increases, which are expected to take effect in March, have been widely criticized for placing an undue burden on commuters already struggling with the rising cost of living. Action for Rail estimates that the average commuter will face an increase of £100 per year, a figure that many find excessive. ""These fare increases are a disgrace,"" declared Sarah, a commuter from Leeds. ""The government and train companies are out of touch with the reality of people's lives. We can't afford these hikes, and we're not going to stand for them."" The protests have received support from several Labour Party politicians, including leader Keir Starmer, who has pledged to freeze fares if elected. The government, however, has defended the increases, arguing that they are necessary to maintain and improve rail services. ""We understand that people are facing financial pressures, but these fare rises are essential to ensure we have a safe and reliable railway system,"" said a spokesperson for the Department for Transport. Despite the government's stance, protesters remain determined to fight the fare increases. Action for Rail has vowed to continue organizing demonstrations and campaigning for affordable rail travel. ""We won't give up,"" said Mark, a spokesperson for the group. ""These fare rises are unfair, and we're going to keep fighting until they're scrapped."" The protests have sparked a wider debate about the future of rail travel in the UK. Many argue that the current system, which is heavily reliant on fare revenue, is unsustainable and needs to be reformed. Alternative funding models, such as a tax on road use or increased government subsidies, have been proposed. As the government prepares to implement the fare increases, it faces growing pressure to reconsider. The protests have shown that public anger is running high, and it remains to be seen whether the government will be able to weather the storm.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Sir Philip Green drops 'gagging' legal action,"Sir Philip Green drops 'gagging' legal action Sir Philip Green has dropped his legal action against the Daily Telegraph newspaper over an article that accused him of sexual harassment and racial abuse. The billionaire businessman had taken legal action against the newspaper and one of its journalists over the article, which was published in October 2018. But on Monday, Green's lawyers told the High Court in London that he was discontinuing the action. The Telegraph had reported that Green had been accused of sexual harassment and racial abuse by five women. The newspaper also alleged that Green had used non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence his accusers. Green has denied the allegations and said that he will not be silenced. In a statement, Green's lawyers said: ""Sir Philip Green has decided to discontinue his claim against the Telegraph and its journalist. ""Sir Philip maintains that the allegations made against him are untrue and that he has not engaged in any wrongdoing. ""However, Sir Philip has taken the decision to discontinue his claim in order to focus on his business and his family."" The Telegraph said in a statement: ""We are pleased that Sir Philip Green has dropped his legal action. ""We stand by our story and we are confident that we would have been successful in defending our case in court."" The decision to drop the legal action comes after a number of high-profile cases involving NDAs. In 2018, the former head of Harvey Weinstein's film studio, Harvey Weinstein, was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. Weinstein has denied the allegations but has since been charged with rape and sexual assault. In the wake of the Weinstein scandal, a number of Hollywood actresses have spoken out about the use of NDAs to silence victims of sexual harassment and assault. In the UK, the government has launched a review of NDAs and their use in cases of sexual harassment and discrimination. The review is being led by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and is due to report back in early 2020. The EHRC has said that it will consider whether NDAs are being used to prevent victims of sexual harassment and discrimination from speaking out. The review will also consider whether NDAs are being used to protect the reputations of powerful individuals and organisations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Bombardier ruling: Q&A,"Bombardier ruling: Q&A What is the Bombardier ruling? The Bombardier ruling is a decision by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that Canada provided illegal subsidies to Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer. The ruling allows Boeing, an American aircraft manufacturer, to impose tariffs on Bombardier's planes. What is the background to the ruling? Boeing filed a complaint with the WTO in 2017, alleging that Canada had provided Bombardier with illegal subsidies. Canada denied the allegations, but the WTO ruled in Boeing's favor in 2020. What are the consequences of the ruling? The ruling allows Boeing to impose tariffs of up to 219% on Bombardier's C Series planes. This could make it very difficult for Bombardier to sell its planes in the United States. What is the Canadian government's response to the ruling? The Canadian government has said that it is ""deeply disappointed"" by the ruling. The government is considering appealing the ruling to the WTO's appellate body. What is the impact of the ruling on the Canadian aerospace industry? The ruling is a major blow to the Canadian aerospace industry. Bombardier is one of Canada's largest aerospace companies, and the tariffs could make it difficult for the company to compete with its rivals. What is the impact of the ruling on the US aerospace industry? The ruling could benefit the US aerospace industry. Boeing is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, and the tariffs could make it more difficult for Bombardier to compete with Boeing in the US market. What is the likely next step? The Canadian government is likely to appeal the ruling to the WTO's appellate body. The appellate body is the highest court in the WTO, and its decision will be final. What is the broader impact of the ruling? The ruling could have a broader impact on the global aerospace industry. It could make it more difficult for governments to provide subsidies to their aerospace companies. This could lead to a more level playing field for aircraft manufacturers around the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Severn Trent 'used Uber drivers to look at water leaks',"Severn Trent Uses Uber Drivers to Detect Water Leaks Severn Trent, one of the UK's largest water companies, has implemented an innovative approach to identifying water leaks by collaborating with Uber drivers. This unique initiative leverages the vast network of Uber vehicles to efficiently survey streets and roads, using technology to locate potential leakages. The partnership between Severn Trent and Uber involves equipping Uber drivers with smartphones that are integrated with a specialized leak detection app. As they drive around, the app constantly monitors water pressure and other indicators, alerting drivers to any abnormalities that may suggest a leak. When a potential leak is identified, the Uber driver marks its location using the app and reports it to Severn Trent. The company then dispatches repair teams to investigate and address the issue promptly. This process allows for early detection and intervention, minimizing water loss and potential damage to properties. ""We're always looking for innovative ways to improve our service to customers,"" said Stuart Jackson, Severn Trent's Director of Leakage. ""Our partnership with Uber is a great example of how we can use technology to make our operations more efficient and effective."" The use of Uber drivers for leak detection has several advantages over traditional methods. Firstly, it provides a widespread network of sensors across the company's operating area. Secondly, it enables real-time monitoring, meaning that leaks can be identified and reported as soon as they occur. Thirdly, it reduces the need for manual surveys and door-to-door inspections, saving time and resources. ""We're delighted to be working with Severn Trent on this innovative project,"" said Tom Elvidge, Uber's Head of Business Development UK. ""Our network of drivers is perfectly placed to help identify leaks in the water network, and we're confident that this partnership will make a real difference in reducing water loss and improving the quality of service for Severn Trent's customers."" The collaboration between Severn Trent and Uber is expected to significantly enhance the company's ability to detect and repair leaks, delivering tangible benefits to both customers and the environment. As the initiative expands, it has the potential to become a model for other utility companies seeking to optimize their operations.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Yemen war: UN agrees to send war crime experts,"The United Nations has agreed to send a team of war crime experts to Yemen to investigate alleged atrocities committed during the country's seven-year conflict. The decision was made at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Thursday. The resolution was passed with 22 votes in favor, 11 against, and 14 abstentions. The team of experts will be tasked with investigating allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by all parties to the conflict. They will also provide recommendations on how to ensure accountability for these crimes. The UN has been calling for an independent investigation into the Yemen conflict for several years. In 2019, the UN Human Rights Council established a Group of Eminent Experts to investigate alleged human rights violations in Yemen. However, the group was unable to deploy to Yemen due to a lack of cooperation from the parties to the conflict. The decision to send a team of war crime experts to Yemen is a significant step forward in the fight for accountability in the country. The team will be able to gather evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and their findings could be used to prosecute those responsible. The conflict in Yemen has been ongoing since 2015, when the Houthi rebel group seized control of the capital, Sanaa. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in the conflict in 2015, and the fighting has since resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. The conflict has also caused a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, with millions of people displaced and facing food insecurity. The UN has called for a ceasefire in Yemen, but the fighting continues.

Lord Heseltine defends decision to vote for Lib Dems,"Lord Heseltine has defended his decision to vote Liberal Democrat in the upcoming general election, saying that it is the ""only way"" to stop Brexit. The former Conservative minister said that he had ""agonised"" over his decision, but that he ultimately believes that it is the ""right thing to do"". ""I have always been a Conservative, but I believe that Brexit is the wrong thing for our country,"" he said. ""I have come to the conclusion that the only way to stop Brexit is to vote Liberal Democrat."" Lord Heseltine's decision to vote Liberal Democrat is a significant blow to the Conservative Party. He is a highly respected figure in the party, and his decision is likely to sway other voters who are considering voting Liberal Democrat. The Liberal Democrats have welcomed Lord Heseltine's decision, saying that it is a ""sign that the tide is turning"" against Brexit. ""We are delighted that Lord Heseltine has decided to join us in the fight against Brexit,"" said Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. ""His decision is a sign that the tide is turning against Brexit, and that people are starting to realise that it is the wrong thing for our country."" The Conservative Party has criticised Lord Heseltine's decision, saying that it is ""a betrayal of the people who voted for him"". ""Lord Heseltine has betrayed the people who voted for him,"" said Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis. ""He is putting his own personal views ahead of the interests of his constituents."" Lord Heseltine's decision to vote Liberal Democrat is a further sign of the divisions within the Conservative Party over Brexit. The party is split between those who support Brexit and those who oppose it, and this division is likely to make it difficult for the party to win the next election. The Liberal Democrats are hoping to capitalise on the divisions within the Conservative Party and win the next election. The party is promising to hold a second referendum on Brexit, and this is likely to appeal to voters who are opposed to Brexit.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Wales Bill 'being rammed through' Parliament, says academic","The Wales Bill, which will devolve further powers to the Welsh government, has been ""rammed through"" Parliament, an academic has claimed. Professor Richard Wyn Jones, from Cardiff University, said the bill had been ""rushed"" through the legislative process without proper scrutiny. He said the UK government had ""failed to engage"" with the Welsh government and other stakeholders, and had ""ignored"" concerns about the bill's impact on devolution. ""This is a deeply flawed bill that will have a negative impact on devolution in Wales,"" Prof Jones said. ""It has been rushed through Parliament without proper scrutiny, and the UK government has failed to engage with the Welsh government and other stakeholders. ""The bill will create a two-tier system of devolution in the UK, with Wales having less power than Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is a betrayal of the people of Wales."" The Wales Bill was introduced to Parliament in July 2022, and was passed by the House of Commons in March 2023. It is currently being considered by the House of Lords. The bill devolves a number of powers to the Welsh government, including responsibility for health, education, and economic development. However, critics have argued that the bill does not go far enough, and that it will not give Wales the powers it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Prof Jones said the bill was a ""missed opportunity"" to strengthen devolution in Wales. ""This bill could have been a landmark piece of legislation that would have given Wales the powers it needs to thrive,"" he said. ""But instead, it is a deeply flawed bill that will have a negative impact on devolution. ""The UK government needs to think again about this bill, and to work with the Welsh government and other stakeholders to develop a bill that will truly strengthen devolution in Wales."" The UK government has defended the Wales Bill, saying it will give Wales ""more powers than ever before"". A UK government spokesperson said: ""The Wales Bill is a historic piece of legislation that will give Wales more powers than ever before. ""It will give the Welsh government the power to make decisions on a wide range of issues that affect the people of Wales, including health, education, and economic development.

Girl guides call for airbrushed photos to be labelled,"Girl Guides Call for Airbrushed Photos to Be Labelled The Girl Guides association has issued an urgent call for airbrushed photos to be clearly labelled, as part of its ongoing campaign to promote positive body image among young people. Research conducted by the organization revealed that 95% of girls surveyed have come across airbrushed photos, with 70% reporting that these images have led them to feel negatively about their own bodies. The Guides believe that the lack of transparency surrounding airbrushed photos is contributing to unrealistic beauty expectations and fueling body dissatisfaction. ""We want young people to have access to honest and authentic images,"" said Angela Salt, Chief Executive of Girlguiding. ""By labelling airbrushed photos, we can challenge the idea that these images are the norm and help girls understand that they are not alone in their experiences of body image struggles."" The Guides' campaign echoes the growing concern among health experts about the impact of unrealistic body ideals on young people. Studies have shown that exposure to airbrushed images can lead to body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and low self-esteem. The call for labelling builds on the Guides' existing work in this area. The organization has developed a toolkit for parents and educators to help them talk to young people about body image, as well as a series of resources for girls to explore positive body acceptance. The Guides are urging media companies, advertising agencies, and social media platforms to take responsibility for the images they share. They suggest using a simple label, such as ""altered,"" to indicate when photos have been significantly edited. ""We believe that by labelling airbrushed photos, we can create a more honest and transparent media landscape,"" said Salt. ""This will help young people develop a healthier relationship with their bodies and promote a more inclusive society."" The campaign has received widespread support from organizations working in the field of body image. The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) praised the move as a ""step in the right direction."" ""We applaud the Girl Guides for taking a stand against the harmful practice of airbrushing,"" said Claire Mysko, CEO of NEDA. ""Labelling these images is essential for helping young people understand that they are seeing an altered version of reality."" The BBC has reached out to several media companies for comment. A spokesperson for one of the UK's largest newspapers said that the company is considering its stance on labelling airbrushed photos. A social media company representative declined to comment.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Nurses' leaders urge 'care for those who caring',"Nurses' leaders have urged the public to show their support for healthcare workers by staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said nurses and other healthcare professionals were ""putting their lives on the line"" to care for patients. The college is calling on the public to show their appreciation by following government advice on social distancing and self-isolation. RCN chief executive and general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said: ""Our nurses and nursing support workers are putting their lives on the line to care for patients during this pandemic. ""They are working long hours in difficult and often frightening conditions. They are putting their own health at risk to protect others. ""We are asking the public to show their support for our nurses and other healthcare professionals by staying at home. ""By following government advice on social distancing and self-isolation, you can help to protect our NHS and save lives."" The RCN's call comes as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK continues to rise. As of 9am on 25 March 2020, there were 9,529 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 465 people had died. The government has advised people to stay at home as much as possible, and to only leave their homes for essential reasons, such as to buy food or to go to work. The RCN is also calling on the government to do more to support nurses and other healthcare professionals during the pandemic.

Crime: Just 1% of magistrates under 30 in Wales,"Just 1% of magistrates in Wales are under 30, figures show. The latest data from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) reveals that out of 1,463 magistrates in Wales, only 15 are aged between 18 and 29. This means that just 1% of magistrates in Wales are under 30, a figure that has remained largely unchanged in recent years. The MoJ said it is ""aware of the importance of diversity on the magistracy"" and is ""committed to increasing the representation of under-represented groups, including young people."" However, critics say that the lack of young magistrates is a ""serious problem"" that is ""failing to reflect the communities they serve."" ""It's simply not fair that young people are so underrepresented on the magistracy,"" said Nerys Evans, a youth worker from Cardiff. ""The magistracy is supposed to represent the community, but it's not doing that when it comes to young people."" Evans said she believes that the lack of young magistrates is ""putting young people off from participating in the justice system."" ""Young people need to see people like themselves on the magistracy if they're going to believe that the justice system is fair,"" she said. The Sentencing Council, which sets guidelines for sentencing in England and Wales, has also expressed concerns about the lack of young magistrates. In a report published in 2019, the Sentencing Council said that ""the magistracy needs to be more representative of the communities it serves, including in terms of age."" The report said that the lack of young magistrates could lead to ""sentencing decisions that are out of touch with the needs of young people."" The MoJ said it is ""working to increase the diversity of the magistracy"" and is ""encouraging more young people to apply."" However, Evans said that more needs to be done to address the issue. ""We need to do more to reach out to young people and let them know about the magistracy,"" she said. ""We also need to make it easier for young people to apply to become magistrates."" She said that the magistracy is ""a great opportunity for young people to make a difference in their communities."" ""I would encourage any young person who is interested in the justice system to apply to become a magistrate,"" she said.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'Racism protests do not get to the root of the problem',"Racism protests, while well-intentioned, often fail to address the underlying causes of racial inequality. These protests tend to focus on symbolic gestures, such as removing statues or changing street names, which do little to tackle the systemic racism embedded in our institutions. True progress requires a more nuanced approach that addresses the economic, social, and political factors that perpetuate racial disparities. For example, we need to improve education and employment opportunities for marginalized communities, address police brutality and racial profiling, and enact policies that promote equity in housing, healthcare, and other essential services. Moreover, protests often devolve into divisive rhetoric and violence, which further alienates those who do not share the protesters' views. This polarization makes it difficult to engage in constructive dialogue and find common ground. Instead, we need to foster a culture of empathy and understanding, where we listen to each other's experiences and work together to find solutions that benefit all members of society. Another limitation of protests is their limited reach. While they may garner media attention, they often do not translate into meaningful policy changes. To achieve lasting impact, we need to mobilize political action, hold elected officials accountable, and support organizations working on the ground to address racial inequality. Furthermore, protests can sometimes be counterproductive, as they can trigger a backlash from those who feel threatened by the demands for change. This can lead to increased resistance and entrenchment of racist attitudes. In conclusion, while racism protests can raise awareness about the issue, they often fall short of addressing the root causes of racial inequality. Instead, we need to focus on systemic solutions, foster empathy and understanding, and engage in constructive political action. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Male voice choirs face 'existential threat',"Coronavirus: Male voice choirs face 'existential threat' Male voice choirs across the UK are facing an ""existential threat"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading singing teacher. David Lawrence, a vocal tutor at the Royal Northern College of Music, said that many choirs have been forced to stop rehearsing and performing, which is having a devastating impact on their finances and morale. ""Male voice choirs are particularly vulnerable because they rely on close harmonies, which is not possible to do safely under social distancing rules,"" he said. ""Many choirs are also losing members because people are afraid to sing in close proximity to others, or because they are shielding or self-isolating."" Lawrence said that some choirs have tried to adapt by rehearsing online, but this is not a long-term solution. ""Singing online is not the same as singing in person,"" he said. ""You lose the physicality, the energy, and the camaraderie that comes from singing together in a group."" He added: ""If this situation continues for much longer, I fear that many male voice choirs will simply disappear."" The threat to male voice choirs is echoed by other singing teachers and choir leaders. Graham Kendrick, a leading choral composer and conductor, said that the pandemic is ""a catastrophe"" for choirs. ""Choirs are all about people coming together to sing and make music,"" he said. ""That's impossible to do under social distancing rules."" Kendrick said that he is particularly concerned about the impact on young singers. ""Choirs provide a vital opportunity for young people to develop their musical skills and confidence,"" he said. ""If we lose our choirs, we will be losing a vital part of our musical culture."" The government has announced a £1.57 billion support package for the arts, but it is unclear how much of this will go to choirs. Lawrence said that he hopes the government will provide specific support for choirs, which are ""a vital part of our musical heritage."" ""Choirs bring people together, they promote mental and physical well-being, and they create a sense of community,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to lose them.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

"Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut cut more than 1,000 jobs","Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut cut more than 1,000 jobs Lloyds Banking Group and Pizza Hut are among the latest companies to cut jobs, as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. Lloyds said it would axe around 900 roles, while Pizza Hut announced plans to close 29 loss-making restaurants and cut 450 jobs. The news comes as a blow to the UK economy, which is already facing a shortage of workers. The unemployment rate is at a record low, and businesses are struggling to fill vacancies. The job cuts at Lloyds are part of a wider cost-cutting drive, which has seen the bank close branches and reduce its workforce in recent years. The bank said the latest job losses were necessary to ""simplify"" its operations and improve efficiency. Pizza Hut said it was closing restaurants that were ""no longer commercially viable"". The company has been struggling in recent years, as competition from other pizza chains has intensified. The job cuts come at a time when the cost of living crisis is squeezing household budgets. Inflation is at a 40-year high, and energy prices have soared. This is making it difficult for people to afford food, energy and other essentials. The job cuts are likely to add to the pressure on the government to take action to help people with the cost of living crisis. The government has already announced a number of measures to help people, including a £400 discount on energy bills and a £650 payment to low-income households. However, some economists believe that the government needs to do more. They argue that the government should increase spending on public services and provide more support to low-income households. The job cuts at Lloyds and Pizza Hut are a reminder of the challenges facing the UK economy. The cost of living crisis is putting pressure on businesses and households, and it is likely to lead to further job losses in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
India tobacco firms halt production over health warning,"India's tobacco companies have temporarily halted production after the government ordered them to carry larger pictorial health warnings on cigarette packets. The new regulations, which came into effect on Saturday, require tobacco companies to cover 85% of the front and back of cigarette packs with graphic images of the harmful effects of smoking. The warnings include images of diseased lungs, mouth cancer, and throat cancer. They also carry messages such as ""Smoking kills"" and ""Tobacco causes painful death."" The tobacco industry has criticized the new regulations, arguing that they are too graphic and will discourage smokers from quitting. The industry has also warned that the regulations could lead to job losses in the tobacco sector. However, the government has defended the new regulations, saying that they are necessary to protect public health. The government has also said that it is committed to helping tobacco farmers and workers transition to other industries. The halt in production is expected to last for a few days while tobacco companies reconfigure their packaging to comply with the new regulations. The new regulations are part of the government's efforts to reduce tobacco consumption in India. India is home to one of the largest tobacco markets in the world, with over 250 million adult smokers. Tobacco use is a major public health problem in India, and it is responsible for over 1 million deaths each year. The government's goal is to reduce tobacco consumption by 30% by 2025. The new regulations are a significant step towards achieving this goal. They are likely to make it more difficult for people to start smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. The tobacco industry has been fighting against the new regulations for years. In 2016, the industry challenged the government's decision to increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. The industry lost the case, and the Supreme Court upheld the government's decision. The tobacco industry is now facing a new challenge from the government. The government is considering banning the sale of cigarettes in individual packs. This would make it more difficult for people to buy cigarettes, and it would also reduce the attractiveness of cigarettes to young people. The tobacco industry is fighting against this new proposal, but it is clear that the government is determined to reduce tobacco consumption in India.

As they approached, the cub began to cry out and lead them through the dense vegetation. With each step, the guards' hopes dwindled, but the cub persisted, guiding them deeper into the forest. Finally, they reached a clearing where the lifeless body of the mother lion lay. The cause of her death remains unknown, but the guards suspect natural causes. The sight of the young cub mourning its mother was deeply moving. The guards witnessed the cub nuzzling its mother's body, licking her fur, and attempting to rouse her. But the mother was gone, leaving the cub alone and vulnerable. The guards carefully removed the cub from the scene and took it to a nearby rescue center. There, the cub is receiving round-the-clock care and is expected to be rehabilitated and eventually released back into the wild. The incident highlights the strong bonds that exist between mothers and their young in the animal kingdom. Even in the face of adversity, these bonds remain unbreakable. The cub's determination to lead the guards to its mother's body is a testament to its resilience and the deep connection it shared with its parent.

As the flames raged, the boy and his family were trapped on the 23rd floor. They desperately tried to escape, but the smoke and heat were too intense. They were forced to retreat back into their apartment, where they huddled together and waited for help. But help never came. The fire brigade arrived at the scene, but they were unable to reach the upper floors of the tower due to the intense heat and smoke. The boy and his family were left to their fate. As the fire continued to intensify, the boy's mother and sister collapsed from smoke inhalation. The boy tried to save them, but he was too weak. He was forced to watch helplessly as they succumbed to the flames. Eventually, the boy himself began to lose consciousness. He was overcome by the smoke and heat, and he slipped into unconsciousness.

'Six-month delay' for Heathrow decision,"'Six-month delay' for Heathrow decision The government has announced a six-month delay to its decision on whether to expand Heathrow Airport. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the delay was necessary to give the government more time to consider the environmental impact of a third runway. The decision was welcomed by environmental groups, but was criticized by business leaders who said it would damage the UK's economy. Heathrow is the UK's busiest airport, and has been operating at full capacity for several years. A third runway would increase the airport's capacity by 50%, and would allow it to handle up to 140 million passengers a year. The government has been considering expanding Heathrow for several years, but has been unable to reach a decision due to concerns about the environmental impact. A third runway would require the destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, and would also increase noise and air pollution. The government has said that it will only approve a third runway if it can be shown that the environmental impact can be minimized. The delay to the decision is likely to give the government more time to consider the environmental impact of a third runway. It will also give the government more time to consult with local residents and businesses. The decision on whether to expand Heathrow is a complex one, and there are strong arguments on both sides. The government will need to weigh the economic benefits of a third runway against the environmental impact before making a decision. Reaction to the delay Environmental groups welcomed the delay to the decision. Friends of the Earth said that the government needed to take more time to consider the environmental impact of a third runway. ""This delay is a victory for common sense and for the environment,"" said Friends of the Earth's aviation campaigner Jenny Bates.

The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, shows that stem cells can be used to repair damaged brain cells in mice with the condition. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, balance and coordination. It is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain. There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, but treatments can help to manage the symptoms. The new research offers hope that stem cells could one day be used to treat or even cure Parkinson's disease. The study was conducted by a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh. They used stem cells from human embryos to create dopamine-producing nerve cells. These cells were then transplanted into the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease. The results showed that the transplanted cells survived and integrated into the brain tissue. The mice showed significant improvements in their motor function and coordination. They were able to walk and move more easily, and their tremors were reduced. The researchers say that the findings are a major step forward in the development of a stem cell treatment for Parkinson's disease. ""This is the first time that stem cells have been shown to improve motor function in a Parkinson's disease model,"" said Professor Roger Barker, from the University of Cambridge. ""These findings offer hope that stem cells could one day be used to treat or even cure Parkinson's disease."" The researchers caution that more research is needed before stem cell treatments can be used in humans. They need to find a way to produce stem cells that are safe and effective for transplantation. They also need to develop a way to deliver the stem cells to the brain without damaging the surrounding tissue. Despite these challenges, the researchers are optimistic that stem cell treatments could one day be a reality for people with Parkinson's disease. ""This is a very exciting development,"" said Professor David Dexter, from the University of Edinburgh. ""If we can overcome the challenges, stem cell treatments could offer a new way to treat Parkinson's disease and improve the lives of people with the condition.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Facebook facial recognition faces class-action suit,"Facebook is facing a class-action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology. The plaintiffs allege that Facebook violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting and storing their facial scans without their consent. BIPA is a state law that regulates the collection, use, and storage of biometric information, such as fingerprints, voiceprints, and facial scans. The law requires companies to obtain written consent from individuals before collecting their biometric information. Facebook has not publicly commented on the lawsuit. However, the company has previously defended its use of facial recognition technology, arguing that it is a valuable tool for protecting users from fraud and abuse. The lawsuit is one of several that have been filed against Facebook over its use of facial recognition technology. In 2021, the company agreed to pay $650 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged Facebook violated BIPA by collecting and storing facial scans of users without their consent. The latest lawsuit is a sign that legal challenges to Facebook's use of facial recognition technology are likely to continue. If the plaintiffs are successful in their lawsuit, Facebook could be forced to pay billions of dollars in damages. The lawsuit also raises concerns about the broader use of facial recognition technology. As the technology becomes more sophisticated, it is increasingly being used by law enforcement and other government agencies. Critics argue that facial recognition technology can be used to track and identify people without their consent, and that it poses a threat to privacy and civil liberties. The lawsuit against Facebook is a reminder that the use of facial recognition technology is a complex issue with legal, ethical, and privacy implications. As the technology continues to develop, it is important to have a public debate about its potential benefits and risks. In addition to the legal challenges, Facebook is also facing regulatory scrutiny over its use of facial recognition technology. In 2021, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) fined Facebook £500,000 for violating the UK's data protection laws by collecting and storing facial scans of users without their consent. The ICO's investigation found that Facebook had collected and stored facial scans of more than 1 million UK users without their knowledge or consent. The ICO also found that Facebook had failed to take adequate steps to protect the facial scans from misuse. The ICO's fine is a significant development in the regulation of facial recognition technology. It is the first time that a regulator has fined a company for violating data protection laws in relation to the use of facial recognition technology. The ICO's decision is a reminder that companies must comply with data protection laws when they collect and store biometric information. Companies must also take adequate steps to protect biometric information from misuse.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
A Bafta bruising for the Brits?,"A Bafta Bruising for the Brits? The British Academy Film Awards (Baftas) are widely recognized as the British equivalent of the Oscars, honoring the best of British and international cinema. However, the recent ceremony raised concerns that British films are facing an uphill battle in the face of stiff competition from Hollywood. Out of the 20 award categories, British films only managed to secure five. ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" a German-language adaptation of a classic anti-war novel, took home seven awards, including Best Film and Best Director. ""The Banshees of Inisherin,"" an Irish black comedy, won Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor. The lackluster showing for British films has prompted questions about the health of the British film industry. Some have argued that the UK is losing its competitive edge due to a combination of factors, including the dominance of streaming services, the rise of international co-productions, and a perceived lack of investment in homegrown talent. The British film industry has long been a source of pride for the nation, producing iconic films such as ""The King's Speech,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" and ""Shakespeare in Love."" However, the declining success at the Baftas suggests that the industry may need to adapt to the changing landscape of filmmaking. One of the key challenges facing British filmmakers is the dominance of Hollywood studios. American films have consistently dominated the box office, and their massive budgets and marketing campaigns give them a significant advantage over smaller British productions. Compounding this issue, streaming services often favor Hollywood content due to its global reach and established fan base. Another factor to consider is the increasing popularity of international co-productions. Films like ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" demonstrate that international collaborations can produce highly successful and critically acclaimed films. However, British filmmakers may find themselves competing for funding and resources against larger international partners. Finally, some critics argue that the British film industry has not done enough to nurture and support homegrown talent. They point to the lack of diversity among British nominees and winners at the Baftas as evidence of a systemic issue within the industry. Despite the challenges, there are still reasons to be optimistic about the future of British film. The UK remains a vibrant and creative hub, with a rich history of filmmaking. By investing in homegrown talent, fostering international collaborations, and adapting to the evolving landscape of cinema, the British film industry can continue to produce world-class films that resonate with audiences worldwide.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Jordan Begley Taser death: Mother saw 'fear in his face',"The mother of Jordan Begley, a 23-year-old man who died after being Tasered by police in Manchester, has spoken of the ""fear in his face"" as she watched him being restrained. Kami Begley said her son had been ""laughing and joking"" with her on the phone just minutes before he was Tasered and arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon on July 10, 2022. Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""I saw the fear in his face. He was just a kid. He didn't deserve to die."" Ms Begley said her son had been Tasered three times by police officers. She said she had seen CCTV footage of the incident and that it showed Jordan being ""pinned down"" by officers before being Tasered. ""I want to know why they Tasered him three times,"" she said. ""He wasn't a threat to anyone."" Jordan Begley's death is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC said in a statement that it was ""aware of the comments made by Jordan Begley's mother"" and that it would ""take them into account as part of our ongoing investigation."" The statement added: ""Our investigators have been in contact with Jordan Begley's family to offer our condolences and to explain our role in investigating his death. We will keep them updated as our investigation progresses."" Tasers are conducted electrical weapons (CEWs) that are used by police to incapacitate people by delivering a high-voltage electric shock. The use of Tasers has been controversial, with critics arguing that they can be dangerous and even fatal. In 2017, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions said that Tasers ""should not be used except when strictly necessary to save lives, and that their use should be subject to strict standards and independent monitoring."" In the United Kingdom, the use of Tasers is governed by the Police Use of Force Manual. The manual states that Tasers should only be used when there is a threat to life or serious injury. The manual also states that officers should only use Tasers for the minimum amount of time necessary to incapacitate the person. The IOPC is investigating Jordan Begley's death to determine whether the use of Tasers was justified in this case.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
MPs criticise government's railway plan,"MPs have criticized the government's railway plan, saying it will lead to higher fares and cuts to services. The plan, which was announced by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps last week, includes a number of measures designed to reduce costs and improve efficiency on the railways. These include increasing the use of driverless trains, closing ticket offices, and reducing the number of trains running on some lines. However, critics argue that these measures will lead to a worse service for passengers. They say that driverless trains are less reliable and that closing ticket offices will make it more difficult for people to buy tickets. They also say that reducing the number of trains running on some lines will make it harder for people to get to work or school. The government has defended the plan, saying it is necessary to reduce the cost of running the railways. It says that the measures it is proposing will save £1bn a year, which will be used to invest in other areas of the transport network. The plan has been met with a mixed reaction from the public. Some people have welcomed the government's focus on reducing costs, while others have expressed concern about the impact the changes will have on services. A recent poll by YouGov found that 42% of people support the government's plan, while 35% oppose it. The remaining 23% are unsure. The government is now facing pressure to address the concerns of critics. It is expected to publish a more detailed version of the plan in the coming weeks, which will include more information about how the changes will affect passengers. The government is also facing legal challenges to the plan. A number of groups, including the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), have announced plans to take legal action to block the changes. The RMT has argued that the government's plan is ""unlawful"" and that it will lead to ""a bonfire of safety standards"". The government has said it will ""vigorously defend"" the plan in court. The row over the government's railway plan is likely to continue for some time. It remains to be seen whether the government will be able to address the concerns of critics and push through the changes it is proposing.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Microsoft moves to disable Zeus botnet,"Microsoft Moves to Disable Zeus Botnet Microsoft has taken action to disable a widespread botnet network known as Zeus, which has been used to steal personal information and financial data from millions of computers worldwide. The Zeus botnet has been active for over a decade and is estimated to have infected over 3.6 million devices. It typically spreads through phishing emails or malicious websites that trick users into downloading and installing the malware. Once installed, the Zeus botnet can steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and bank account details. It can also control infected computers remotely, allowing attackers to launch DDoS attacks or distribute other malware. To combat the Zeus botnet, Microsoft has released a security update that disables the malware's functionality. The update is available for all supported versions of Windows, including Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7. In addition to the security update, Microsoft has also partnered with law enforcement agencies to take down the Zeus botnet's command and control servers. This has disrupted the botnet's operations and made it more difficult for attackers to use it to steal information or launch attacks. Users who suspect their computers have been infected with the Zeus botnet are advised to take the following steps: Install the Microsoft security update. The update is available through Windows Update or the Microsoft Update Catalog. Scan your computer with an antivirus program. This will help detect and remove any remaining Zeus malware. Change your passwords. If you have used the same password on multiple websites, change them immediately to prevent attackers from accessing your accounts. Monitor your financial accounts.

Postal workers 'need new law to stop dog attacks',"Postal workers 'need new law to stop dog attacks' Postal workers are calling for a new law to protect them from dog attacks after a surge in incidents. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said there were 1,101 reported dog attacks on postal workers in the UK last year, up from 882 in 2020. The union said the current law, which makes it an offence to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place, is not strong enough to deter owners from letting their pets roam free. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""Postal workers are being attacked at an alarming rate and the current law is simply not doing enough to protect them. ""We need a new law that makes it clear that dog owners are responsible for their pets' behaviour and that they could face serious consequences if their dog attacks someone."" The CWU is calling for the government to introduce a new law that would: Make it an offence to allow a dog to be off its lead in a public place without the owner being in control of it Introduce a mandatory fine for dog owners whose pets attack someone Allow police to seize and destroy dogs that have attacked someone The union said the new law is needed to send a clear message to dog owners that they must take responsibility for their pets. Mr Ward said: ""Dog attacks are a serious problem and we need to do more to protect postal workers and other members of the public. ""A new law is the only way to ensure that dog owners are held accountable for their pets' behaviour."" The Royal Mail said it is working with the CWU to reduce the number of dog attacks on its staff. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We take the safety of our employees very seriously and we are working closely with the CWU to reduce the number of dog attacks on our staff. ""We have a number of measures in place to protect our employees, including training for our staff on how to deal with dogs, and we are always looking for ways to improve our safety procedures."" The RSPCA said it is also concerned about the increase in dog attacks on postal workers. RSPCA dog welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines said: ""Dog attacks are a serious problem and we are concerned about the increase in incidents involving postal workers.

Monmouth school's warning to parents in uniform row,"Monmouth School's Warning to Parents in Uniform Row Monmouth School has issued a stern warning to parents after a number of students were caught wearing incorrect uniforms. The school's headmaster, Dr. Andrew Daniel, said that the issue had become ""a serious concern"" and that parents needed to ""take responsibility"" for ensuring their children were adhering to the school's dress code. ""It's important that our students are smart and well-presented at all times,"" said Dr. Daniel. ""Not only does this reflect well on the school, but it also helps to create a sense of pride and community among our students."" The school's uniform policy is clearly laid out in the school prospectus and on the school website. It states that all students must wear a black blazer with the school badge, a white shirt, black trousers or skirt, and black shoes. Students are also required to wear a school tie and socks. However, in recent weeks, a number of students have been caught wearing incorrect items of clothing, such as trainers, jeans, and hoodies. Dr. Daniel said that this was ""completely unacceptable"" and that parents needed to ""reinforce the school's expectations"" at home. ""We understand that parents are busy and that it can be difficult to keep track of everything their children are wearing,"" said Dr. Daniel. ""However, we would ask all parents to please check their children's uniforms on a regular basis and to ensure that they are compliant with the school's policy."" The school has also warned that students who are caught wearing incorrect uniforms may face disciplinary action. This could include detention, suspension, or even expulsion in severe cases. ""We hope that parents will work with us to ensure that our students are always wearing the correct uniform,"" said Dr. Daniel. ""This is a matter of pride and respect for the school, and we are confident that with the cooperation of parents, we can maintain the high standards that we have always set for our students."" The school's uniform policy is designed to ensure that all students are treated equally, regardless of their background or financial circumstances.

Junaid Hafeez: Academic sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan,"Junaid Hafeez: Academic sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan Pakistani academic Junaid Hafeez has been sentenced to death for blasphemy, in a case that has sparked international condemnation. Hafeez, a professor at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, was arrested in 2013 after he was accused of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad during a lecture. He was convicted in 2019 under Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which carry a mandatory death sentence. Hafeez's appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court in October 2022, upholding the death sentence. Hafeez's case has drawn widespread criticism from human rights groups, who say he is a victim of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which they argue are often used to suppress dissent. The blasphemy laws have been in place since the 1980s, and have been used to prosecute numerous people, including journalists, activists, and minorities. Critics say the laws are vague and open to abuse, and that they have created a climate of fear and censorship in Pakistan. In the wake of Hafeez's sentencing, there have been calls for the government to repeal the blasphemy laws. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said he will not allow anyone to be executed for blasphemy, but he has not committed to repealing the laws. Hafeez's case is just one example of the ongoing challenges faced by freedom of expression in Pakistan. The country has a long history of censorship and suppression of dissent, and the blasphemy laws are a major obstacle to free speech. Hafeez's death sentence is a reminder of the dangers of speaking out in Pakistan, and the need for the government to repeal the blasphemy laws and protect freedom of expression. Background Pakistan's blasphemy laws were first introduced under the military dictatorship of General Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. The laws were originally intended to protect the country's religious minorities, but they have been increasingly used to suppress dissent and silence critics of the government. The laws are vague and open to interpretation, and they have been used to prosecute people for a wide range of offenses, including making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad, insulting Islam, and even criticizing the government. The blasphemy laws have been condemned by human rights groups, who say they violate international standards of freedom of expression. The laws have also been criticized by many within Pakistan, who argue that they have created a climate of fear and censorship in the country. In recent years, there have been calls for the government to repeal the blasphemy laws. However, the government has resisted these calls, arguing that the laws are necessary to protect the country's religious values. The blasphemy laws remain a major obstacle to freedom of expression in Pakistan, and their continued existence is a threat to the country's democratic development.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Joining first Welsh Youth Parliament 'incredible',"Joining the first Welsh Youth Parliament has been an incredible experience for me.

One of the highlights of my time in the Youth Parliament was attending the UK Youth Parliament summit in London. We met with MPs and government ministers, and we were able to share our views on the issues that matter to us. It was an amazing opportunity to be able to have our voices heard at such a high level. Through the Youth Parliament, I have also been able to get involved in a number of projects that I am passionate about. I am currently working on a campaign to raise awareness of mental health issues among young people. I am also involved in a project to encourage more young people to participate in politics. I believe that the Welsh Youth Parliament is an important voice for young people in Wales. It gives us a platform to share our views and to make a difference in our communities. I am proud to be a part of it, and I would encourage all young people in Wales to get involved. Here are some specific examples of how the Welsh Youth Parliament has made a difference: We have campaigned successfully for the introduction of free bus travel for young people in Wales. We have worked with the Welsh Government to develop a new strategy for youth services in Wales. We have represented the views of young people in Wales at the UK Youth Parliament summit. We have worked with a number of organisations to raise awareness of important issues such as mental health and climate change. I believe that the Welsh Youth Parliament is a vital part of Welsh democracy.

"Pigs can play video games with their snouts, scientists find","Pigs can play video games with their snouts, scientists find Pigs are not just intelligent animals, they are also capable of playing video games with their snouts, scientists have found. A study published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology has shown that pigs can use their snouts to control a cursor on a screen and navigate a simple game. The study involved four pigs that were trained to use their snouts to move a cursor around a screen and click on targets. The pigs were able to learn the game quickly and were able to reach a high level of accuracy. The researchers behind the study say that their findings show that pigs have the cognitive abilities to play video games and that they may even be able to learn more complex games in the future. ""Our study shows that pigs are capable of learning and playing video games, which suggests that they have higher cognitive abilities than we previously thought,"" said Dr. Candace Croney, lead author of the study. ""This study opens up new possibilities for research into the cognitive abilities of pigs and other animals,"" she said. The study is the first to show that pigs can play video games with their snouts. However, it is not the first time that animals have been shown to be able to play video games. In 2002, a study showed that monkeys could learn to play the video game Pong using a joystick. And in 2015, a study showed that rats could learn to play the video game Pac-Man using a touchscreen. The ability of animals to play video games is a testament to their intelligence and their ability to learn and adapt.

Stormont crisis: Simon Hamilton says no new money for welfare deal,"Northern Ireland's former finance minister has warned that the British government will not provide any new funding to help break the political deadlock at Stormont. Simon Hamilton said the current welfare reform package on offer from Westminster was the ""best and final"" deal and further concessions would not be made. His comments came as the DUP and Sinn Fein continued to trade blame over the failure to reach an agreement on the devolution of policing and justice powers. The two parties have been locked in talks for months, but a deal has yet to be reached on a number of key issues, including the future of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The DUP wants to see a reduction in the number of PSNI officers, while Sinn Fein wants to see an increase. The two parties are also at odds over the issue of legacy inquests into Troubles-related deaths. Hamilton said the UK government was ""frustrated"" by the lack of progress and was not prepared to offer any more money to help break the deadlock. ""The UK government has made it clear that the current welfare reform package is the best and final deal on offer,"" he said. ""There will be no new money made available."" Hamilton said the DUP and Sinn Fein needed to ""get their act together"" and reach an agreement. ""The people of Northern Ireland deserve better than this,"" he said. ""They deserve a functioning government that is able to deliver for them."" The DUP and Sinn Fein have been urged to reach a deal by the end of the month. If they fail to do so, the UK government could impose direct rule from Westminster. Direct rule would see Northern Ireland being run by a team of civil servants from London. It would be a major setback for the devolution process in Northern Ireland and could lead to a return to violence. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been warned that they have a ""responsibility"" to reach an agreement. The two parties need to ""put the people of Northern Ireland first"" and find a way to resolve their differences, he said.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan asks Facebook to help fight blasphemy,"Pakistan's government has written to Facebook asking for help in combating blasphemy on its platform. In a letter sent to the social media giant, the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication requested that Facebook remove content that is deemed blasphemous and cooperate with law enforcement investigations. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Pakistan, where it is illegal to defame Islam or the Prophet Muhammad. Offenders can face severe penalties, including the death sentence. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of people being accused of blasphemy, often on social media. The government's request to Facebook comes amid growing concerns about the spread of blasphemy-related content online. In 2020, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) blocked access to several websites and social media pages for allegedly hosting blasphemous content. However, critics argue that these measures are often arbitrary and have led to the censorship of legitimate dissent. Facebook has not yet responded to the government's request. However, the company has previously stated that it does not tolerate hate speech or content that incites violence. In 2018, Facebook removed several pages and groups in Pakistan for violating its community standards on hate speech. The government's request to Facebook has sparked debate among legal experts and civil society groups. Some argue that the government is right to take action against blasphemy, while others warn that the request could be used to suppress freedom of expression. ""The government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from hate speech and incitement to violence,"" said Salman Akram Raja, a lawyer and human rights activist. ""However, it is important to ensure that any measures taken do not violate the right to freedom of expression."" Others argue that the government's request is an attempt to silence dissent and curtail freedom of expression. ""The government is using blasphemy as a weapon to suppress criticism and dissent,"" said Taha Siddiqui, a researcher at the Digital Rights Foundation. ""This request to Facebook is a dangerous step that could have serious consequences for freedom of expression in Pakistan."" The debate over blasphemy and freedom of expression is likely to continue in Pakistan. The government's request to Facebook is a sign that the issue is not going away anytime soon.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Somali famine: Care aid driver abducted in Kenyan camp,"Somali famine: Care aid driver abducted in Kenyan camp A driver working for the international aid agency Care has been abducted from a refugee camp in Kenya. The man, who is Kenyan, was seized by armed men from the Dadaab camp complex on Tuesday evening. Care said in a statement that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the driver's safety and called for his immediate release. The abduction comes as Somalia faces its worst drought in decades, which has left millions of people at risk of starvation. Dadaab is the world's largest refugee camp, housing more than 350,000 people who have fled conflict and drought in Somalia. The camp has been plagued by insecurity in recent months, with a number of aid workers being killed or kidnapped. In July, two aid workers from the Norwegian Refugee Council were killed in an ambush in the camp. The Kenyan government has deployed additional security forces to the camp, but the situation remains volatile. The abduction of the Care driver is a reminder of the challenges facing aid workers in Somalia. The country is one of the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers, with a number of groups targeting them for kidnapping or attack. Despite the risks, aid agencies are continuing to provide vital assistance to the people of Somalia. Care said that it was committed to continuing its work in Dadaab and called on all parties to respect the neutrality and safety of aid workers. ""We urge all parties to the conflict to respect the humanitarian space and allow aid workers to carry out their lifesaving work,"" the statement said. The United Nations has warned that Somalia is facing a ""catastrophic"" famine, with more than 6 million people at risk of starvation. The drought has destroyed crops and livestock, and has also led to a sharp rise in food prices. The UN is appealing for $1.5 billion to provide food aid and other assistance to Somalia. The international community must do everything it can to help the people of Somalia avoid a famine.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Kim Jong-nam killing: North Korea condemns Malaysia,"North Korea has strongly condemned Malaysia's handling of the investigation into the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea accused Malaysia of ""fabricating evidence"" and ""politicising"" the case. The statement said that Malaysia had ""colluded with hostile forces"" to ""tarnish the image"" of North Korea and ""justify their illegal sanctions."" It also accused Malaysia of ""detaining and torturing"" North Korean suspects in the case. Malaysia has rejected North Korea's accusations, saying that the investigation was conducted in a ""fair and transparent"" manner. Kim Jong-nam was killed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February 2017. He was poisoned with a nerve agent, VX, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction. Two women, an Indonesian and a Vietnamese, were convicted of murder in 2017. They claimed that they were tricked into carrying out the attack and did not know that they were handling a deadly substance. North Korea has denied any involvement in Kim Jong-nam's death. However, Malaysian authorities believe that the attack was carried out by North Korean agents. The killing of Kim Jong-nam has strained relations between Malaysia and North Korea. Malaysia has expelled the North Korean ambassador and recalled its own ambassador from Pyongyang. North Korea has also banned Malaysians from leaving the country. The case has also raised concerns about the use of chemical weapons and the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. In a separate statement, North Korea's foreign ministry said that it would ""take all necessary measures"" to protect its citizens and its sovereignty. It also warned that Malaysia would ""pay a price"" for its actions. The Malaysian government has said that it is ""deeply concerned"" by North Korea's threats and has urged Pyongyang to ""refrain from any further provocative actions.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Salary subsidy scheme extended into June,"Salary subsidy scheme extended into June The government has announced that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, will be extended until the end of June. The scheme was originally due to end on April 30, but the government has decided to extend it for an extra two months to help businesses that are still struggling due to the pandemic. The extension will cost the government an additional £8.5 billion, but it is hoped that it will help to prevent mass redundancies and keep businesses afloat. The scheme has been welcomed by businesses and trade unions, who say it is essential for protecting jobs and businesses. However, some economists have warned that the extension could lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long run, as businesses may become reliant on the scheme. The government has said that it will continue to review the scheme and will make further announcements in due course. What does this mean for you? If you are currently furloughed, you will continue to receive 80% of your wages until the end of June. Your employer will need to continue to claim for your wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. If you are not currently furloughed, but your employer is still struggling due to the pandemic, you may be eligible for furlough. You should speak to your employer to find out if you are eligible and how to apply. How to apply for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme Employers can apply for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme through the HMRC website. Employers will need to provide information about their employees, such as their name, National Insurance number, and salary. Employers will also need to provide evidence that they have been affected by the pandemic, such as a reduction in sales or profits. What if I am not eligible for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme? If you are not eligible for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, you may be able to claim other benefits, such as Universal Credit or the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme.

US seizes millions of dollars of Iranian fuel bound for Venezuela,"The United States has seized millions of dollars worth of Iranian fuel bound for Venezuela, accusing the two countries of violating sanctions. The US Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had seized four Iranian tankers carrying 1.1 million barrels of fuel, worth an estimated $40 million. The tankers were intercepted in the Arabian Sea on May 25. The seizure is the latest escalation in tensions between the US and Iran, which have been heightened by the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear program and its support for militant groups in the Middle East. Venezuela, which is also facing US sanctions, has been a close ally of Iran in recent years. The two countries have signed a number of economic and military agreements, and Iran has provided Venezuela with financial and technical assistance. The US alleges that the fuel shipment was part of a broader effort by Iran to support the Maduro regime in Venezuela. The US has accused Maduro of being a dictator who has rigged elections and violated human rights. The Venezuelan government has condemned the US seizure of the fuel shipment, calling it an ""act of piracy."" The Venezuelan foreign ministry said in a statement that the fuel was purchased legally and was intended for the Venezuelan people. The US Justice Department said that the seizure of the fuel shipment was justified because it violated US sanctions against Iran. The department said that Iran was using the fuel shipment to support the Maduro regime, which the US considers to be a pariah state. The seizure of the fuel shipment is likely to further escalate tensions between the US and Iran. It is also likely to put further pressure on the Maduro regime in Venezuela, which is already facing a severe economic crisis. The seizure of the fuel shipment is a reminder of the deep divisions between the US and Iran, and of the challenges that the Biden administration faces in trying to improve relations with Iran.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Quarter of children in north Wales overweight or obese,"Nearly a quarter of children in north Wales are overweight or obese, according to new figures. Data from Public Health Wales shows that 24.3% of four and five-year-olds and 27.8% of 10 and 11-year-olds in the region are overweight or obese. The figures are higher than the national average for Wales, which is 22.3% for four and five-year-olds and 26.5% for 10 and 11-year-olds. Experts say the problem is due to a number of factors, including poor diet and lack of exercise. Dr Sarah Aitken, a consultant in public health at Public Health Wales, said: ""We know that childhood obesity is a major public health concern. It can lead to a range of health problems in later life, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. ""There are a number of things that can be done to tackle childhood obesity, including improving diet and increasing physical activity. It's important that children eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, and that they get regular exercise."" The figures show that the problem of childhood obesity is particularly acute in some parts of north Wales. In Wrexham, for example, 30% of four and five-year-olds are overweight or obese, and 35% of 10 and 11-year-olds. In Flintshire, the figures are 27% for four and five-year-olds and 30% for 10 and 11-year-olds. Dr Aitken said: ""We are working with local authorities and other partners to tackle childhood obesity in north Wales. We are providing support to families to help them make healthy choices, and we are also working to improve the food environment in schools and communities.""

Thousands of low-paid Britons set for pay rise,"Thousands of low-paid Britons are set for a pay rise as the national living wage increases. The new rate, which will come into effect on April 1, will see workers aged 23 and over receive a pay rise of 9.7%, or 82p an hour. This will take the national living wage to £9.50 an hour. The increase is the biggest in the history of the national living wage, and is designed to help workers keep up with the rising cost of living. The increase is expected to benefit around 2 million workers, and will add around £1,000 to their annual earnings. The government has said that the increase is ""a fair deal for workers"" and will help to ""boost the economy"". However, some businesses have warned that the increase could lead to job losses. The British Chambers of Commerce has said that the increase is ""a significant cost for businesses"" and could lead to ""tough decisions"" being made about staffing levels. The national living wage was introduced in 2016 and is designed to provide a minimum level of pay for workers aged 23 and over. The rate is reviewed annually and is based on the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. The Low Pay Commission is an independent body that is responsible for setting the national living wage. The commission takes into account a number of factors when making its recommendations, including the cost of living, the level of inflation, and the productivity of the economy. The increase in the national living wage is a positive step for low-paid workers. However, it is important to ensure that the increase does not lead to job losses. The government and businesses need to work together to ensure that the increase is implemented in a way that benefits both workers and businesses.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Compulsory mental health detentions in Scotland at record high,"Compulsory mental health detentions in Scotland have reached a record high, with nearly 2,500 people being detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 in 2021/22. This represents an increase of 7% on the previous year and is the highest number since the Act came into force in 2005. The figures, published by Public Health Scotland, show that the majority of people detained were over the age of 18 and that more women than men were detained. The most common reason for detention was schizophrenia, followed by bipolar affective disorder and depression. The increase in detentions has been attributed to a number of factors, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to increased levels of stress and anxiety. There have also been concerns about the availability of mental health services, with some people being detained because there is no other appropriate place for them to receive care. Mental health campaigners have expressed concern about the rising number of detentions, arguing that it is a sign that the mental health system is not working properly. They say that people should only be detained as a last resort and that there should be more investment in community-based mental health services. The Scottish Government has said that it is committed to reducing the number of compulsory detentions and that it is working to improve the provision of mental health services. However, campaigners say that more needs to be done to address the underlying causes of mental ill-health, such as poverty, inequality and discrimination. In a statement, the Scottish Government said: ""We are committed to improving mental health services in Scotland and reducing the number of compulsory detentions.

Sainsbury's-Asda deal faces investigation,"Sainsbury's-Asda deal faces investigation The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the proposed merger of Sainsbury's and Asda. The two supermarkets announced plans to merge in April, in a deal that would create the UK's largest supermarket chain. The CMA said it was concerned that the merger could lead to higher prices, less choice and reduced innovation in the grocery market. It will now investigate the deal in more detail, and has invited comments from interested parties. Sainsbury's and Asda have said they are confident that the merger will benefit consumers. They argue that it will allow them to invest more in lower prices, better products and improved services. However, the CMA has said it is concerned that the merger could lead to a number of negative consequences for consumers. One concern is that the merged company would have a dominant position in the grocery market, which could give it the power to raise prices. Another concern is that the merger could lead to less choice for consumers, as the two supermarkets would be likely to reduce the number of competing products on their shelves. The CMA is also concerned that the merger could stifle innovation in the grocery market. Sainsbury's and Asda are both major investors in new products and technologies. The CMA is concerned that the merger could reduce the incentive for them to invest in innovation, as they would no longer be competing with each other. The CMA's investigation is expected to take several months. If the CMA finds that the merger would be harmful to competition, it could block the deal or require Sainsbury's and Asda to make changes to their plans. The CMA's decision will be final and binding on Sainsbury's and Asda. The proposed merger has been met with mixed reactions from industry experts. Some analysts believe that the merger would benefit consumers, while others believe that it could lead to higher prices and less choice. The CMA's investigation will help to determine whether the merger would be beneficial or harmful to competition, and ultimately to consumers.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Julia Donaldson: Children's authors 'don't get recognition',"Acclaimed British children's author Julia Donaldson has lamented the lack of recognition given to her fellow writers in the industry. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Donaldson argued that children's authors often receive less attention and respect than those who write for adults. ""It's a bit of a strange thing,"" she said. ""Children's authors don't get the same kind of recognition as adult authors. It's almost as if it's not seen as being as serious."" Donaldson, who has written over 200 books for children, including the best-selling ""The Gruffalo,"" believes this disparity is due to a number of factors. ""I think part of it is that children's books are often seen as being something that you read to your children, rather than something that you read for yourself,"" she explained. ""This can lead to the assumption that children's authors are not as skilled or accomplished as adult authors."" Donaldson also pointed to the fact that children's books are often shorter and less complex than adult books, which can contribute to the perception that they are less worthy of critical attention. ""I think it's important to remember that just because a book is shorter doesn't mean it's less valuable,"" she said. ""Some of the most important and influential books in the world are children's books."" Donaldson called for a greater appreciation of the work that children's authors do, arguing that they play a vital role in shaping young minds. ""Children's books can teach children about important values, such as kindness, empathy, and perseverance,"" she said. ""They can also help children to develop their imaginations and to learn about the world around them."" Donaldson's comments have sparked a debate about the importance of children's literature and the need to give its authors more recognition. Some critics have argued that Donaldson's concerns are overblown, pointing to the fact that many children's authors have achieved great success and critical acclaim. However, others have agreed with Donaldson, arguing that children's authors often face an uphill battle when it comes to gaining recognition for their work. Regardless of the debate, Donaldson's comments have highlighted the importance of children's literature and the need to give its authors the respect they deserve.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Anger at Manx mobile library cuts,"Anger at Manx Mobile Library Cuts Residents of the Isle of Man have expressed outrage over the government's decision to slash funding for the island's mobile library service. The cuts, announced in the government's budget last month, will see the number of mobile library stops reduced from 101 to just 21 per week. The mobile library service is a lifeline for many residents, particularly those in rural areas who have difficulty accessing traditional libraries. The service provides books, audiobooks, DVDs, and other resources to communities that would otherwise be underserved. ""This is a devastating blow to our community,"" said Margaret Jones, a resident of the village of Laxey. ""The mobile library is our only source of books and other resources. Without it, we'll be cut off from the outside world."" The government has argued that the cuts are necessary to save money. However, critics say the government is prioritizing cost-cutting over the welfare of the island's residents. ""The government is putting profits before people,"" said Peter Karran, a member of the Manx parliament. ""These cuts will have a devastating impact on our most vulnerable citizens."" The Isle of Man Library Service has launched a petition to save the mobile library service. The petition has already gathered thousands of signatures. ""We are determined to fight these cuts,"" said Sarah Cormode, the head of the library service. ""The mobile library is an essential service that provides vital resources to our community."" The government has said it will consider the feedback from the public before making a final decision on the cuts. However, residents are concerned that the government has already made up its mind. ""We're not going to give up without a fight,"" said Jones. ""The mobile library is too important to our community to let it go without a fight.""

UUP leader Mike Nesbitt rules out electoral pact with DUP,"UUP leader Mike Nesbitt rules out electoral pact with DUP Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Mike Nesbitt has ruled out an electoral pact with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ahead of the upcoming Assembly election in Northern Ireland. Nesbitt made the announcement during an interview with BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, where he said that the UUP would be ""going it alone"" in the election. He said: ""We are not going to enter into any pacts or alliances with any other party. We are going to fight this election on our own terms, with our own policies, and with our own candidates."" Nesbitt's comments come after months of speculation about the possibility of an electoral pact between the UUP and the DUP. Some observers had suggested that such a pact could help to unite the unionist vote and maximize their chances of winning seats in the Assembly. However, Nesbitt has consistently rejected the idea of a pact, arguing that it would be a ""betrayal"" of the UUP's principles. He has also said that he believes the UUP can win the election on its own merits. The UUP is currently the third-largest party in the Assembly, with 10 seats. The DUP is the largest party, with 28 seats. The Assembly election is scheduled to take place on May 5, 2022. The election will be held to elect 90 members to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The UUP is aiming to increase its number of seats in the Assembly and become the main opposition party. The DUP is aiming to win the most seats and remain the largest party in the Assembly. The election is expected to be closely contested, with a number of parties in contention for seats. The outcome of the election could have a significant impact on the future of Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nawaz Sharif: Ex-PM leaves Pakistan for medical treatment,"Nawaz Sharif: Ex-PM leaves Pakistan for medical treatment Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has left the country for medical treatment in London. The 69-year-old politician was convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to seven years in prison. However, he was released on bail in 2019 on medical grounds. Sharif has been suffering from heart problems and was diagnosed with lymphoma last year. His doctors have advised him to seek treatment abroad. Sharif's departure from Pakistan comes at a time of heightened political tensions in the country. The government of Prime Minister Imran Khan has been accused of persecuting its political opponents, including Sharif. Sharif's supporters have welcomed his release on medical grounds, but have also expressed concern about the government's motives. They believe that Sharif is being targeted because of his political views. The government has denied these accusations, saying that Sharif is being treated fairly and that the law must be upheld. Sharif's departure from Pakistan is likely to further strain relations between the government and the opposition. It is also likely to raise questions about the rule of law in Pakistan. Sharif's supporters believe that he is a victim of political persecution. They point to the fact that he has been convicted of corruption on the basis of flimsy evidence. They also argue that the government has used the courts to target its political opponents. The government, on the other hand, maintains that Sharif is a corrupt politician who has been convicted of serious crimes. They argue that the law must be upheld and that no one is above the law. It is unclear how long Sharif will remain in London. His doctors have said that he will need to undergo extensive treatment. It is possible that he will not be able to return to Pakistan for several months. Sharif's departure from Pakistan is a significant development in the country's political landscape. It is likely to have a major impact on the relationship between the government and the opposition.

Khashoggi fiancée calls for Premier League to block Newcastle Saudi takeover,"Khashoggi fiancée calls for Premier League to block Newcastle Saudi takeover Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has called on the Premier League to block the proposed takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-backed consortium. The £300m deal, which would see the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) take an 80% stake in the club, has been met with widespread criticism from human rights groups. Cengiz, who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi government since Khashoggi's murder in 2018, said that the takeover would ""reward"" the regime for its human rights abuses. ""The Premier League must not allow itself to be used as a sportswashing tool by a regime that has committed horrific crimes,"" she said. ""Jamal was a journalist who was brutally murdered for speaking out against the Saudi government. His killers have never been brought to justice, and the Saudi regime continues to suppress dissent and violate human rights. ""Allowing the Saudi regime to buy Newcastle United would send a dangerous message that those who commit human rights abuses can get away with it. It would also give the Saudi government a platform to whitewash its image and distract from its appalling human rights record."" Cengiz's call has been echoed by a number of other human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Amnesty International has said that the takeover would be a ""disaster for human rights"", while Human Rights Watch has called on the Premier League to ""put human rights first"" and block the deal. The Premier League has said that it is ""considering all relevant factors"" before making a decision on the takeover. However, it is under increasing pressure to block the deal, particularly in light of the recent release of a US intelligence report which concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved Khashoggi's murder. The report, which was released by the Biden administration in February, said that bin Salman had ""authorized"" Khashoggi's killing ""in order to silence his criticism of the regime"". The Premier League has come under fire in recent years for its close ties to Saudi Arabia. In 2020, the league signed a £30m-a-year deal with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster beIN Sports. The league has also been criticized for its decision to stage its overseas Super Cup matches in Saudi Arabia. The 2022 Super Cup match between Liverpool and Chelsea was held in Jeddah, despite the fact that the city is known for its human rights abuses. Cengiz said that the Premier League's ties to Saudi Arabia ""must end"". ""The league cannot continue to do business with a regime that has blood on its hands,"" she said. ""I urge the Premier League to listen to the voices of human rights defenders and block the Newcastle takeover. It is the right thing to do.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Birmingham prison inmates' letters laced with drugs,"Birmingham Prison inmates' letters laced with drugs Letters sent to inmates at Birmingham Prison have been found to contain drugs, the BBC has learned. The drugs, which include synthetic cannabinoids and benzodiazepines, are being soaked into the paper and then dried before being sent to prisoners. The practice is known as ""paper doping"" and is becoming increasingly common in prisons across the country. The drugs are believed to be smuggled into the prison by visitors or staff. Once inside, they are then passed on to inmates, who can smoke the paper or dissolve it in water and drink it. The use of paper doping is a major concern for prison staff, as it can lead to a number of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart problems, and seizures. Inmates who are caught using drugs can face additional charges and may have their sentences extended. The discovery of drugs in letters sent to Birmingham Prison comes just weeks after a similar incident at HMP Wandsworth in London. In that case, letters were found to contain a synthetic cannabinoid known as ""spice."" The use of spice has been linked to a number of deaths in prisons across the country. The Ministry of Justice has said that it is aware of the issue of paper doping and is working to address it. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: ""We are aware of the issue of paper doping and are working to address it. We are working with prisons to improve security measures and to prevent drugs from being smuggled into prisons."" The use of paper doping is a serious problem that is putting the lives of inmates at risk.

Clara Ponsati arrest case is delayed,"The extradition case against former Catalan minister Clara Ponsatí has been delayed until next year. Ponsatí, who is accused of rebellion and misuse of public funds in relation to Catalonia's failed independence referendum in 2017, was arrested in Scotland in March. She was due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday for a procedural hearing. However, the case has now been adjourned until 18 March 2022. A lawyer for Ponsatí said the delay was due to the ""complexity"" of the case and the need for further legal submissions. The Spanish authorities have been seeking Ponsatí's extradition since 2018. She is one of several Catalan politicians who have been living in exile since the failed referendum. The Spanish government has accused Ponsatí of being a key figure in the Catalan independence movement. She was the education minister in the Catalan government at the time of the referendum. Ponsatí has denied the charges against her and has said she is being politically persecuted. She has also said she will not return to Spain voluntarily. The extradition case is likely to be closely watched by other Catalan politicians who are facing similar charges. It could also have implications for the future of the Catalan independence movement. The Scottish government has said it will not extradite Ponsatí if she faces the possibility of being imprisoned for her political beliefs. The UK government has said it will consider the Spanish authorities' request for extradition ""in accordance with the law"". Ponsatí's arrest has sparked protests in Scotland and Catalonia.

"Dr Michael Watt patient recall: Further 1,044 people recalled","Dr Michael Watt patient recall: Further 1,044 people recalled NHS Tayside has recalled a further 1,044 patients of a disgraced former Tayside doctor. Dr Michael Watt, 63, was jailed for three years in 2011 for abusing 11 young female patients while working as a GP in Carnoustie, Angus. NHS Tayside has now written to 1,044 additional patients who were seen by Watt between 1981 and 1995. The board said a review of Watt's medical records had identified a ""small number"" of patients who may have been exposed to inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour. Dr Watt's offending came to light after a woman came forward in 2009 to report a complaint. She told police that she had been abused by Watt during breast examinations when she was a teenager. Watt denied the allegations but was found guilty of 11 charges of indecent assault and one charge of sexual assault by penetration. The former GP has never admitted his guilt and maintained his innocence throughout the investigation and legal proceedings. Following his conviction, Watt was struck off the medical register and jailed for three years. In 2014, the General Medical Council (GMC) ruled that the former GP's fitness to practice was impaired because of his conviction. The GMC said Watt had shown a ""persistent pattern of inappropriate behaviour"" and had breached patient trust. In a statement, NHS Tayside said: ""We are writing to a further 1,044 patients who were seen by Dr Watt between 1981 and 1995.

Questions over school holiday fine pay-back in Wales,"Questions have been raised about school holiday fine repayments in Wales, after several councils confirmed they do not intend to give parents the money back. The Welsh government announced last week that it will scrap the £60 fines, which were introduced in 2014 for parents who take their children on holiday during term time without permission. However, some councils have said they will not be refunding the fines that have already been issued. Powys County Council said it would not be refunding fines, as the money had already been spent on ""essential services"". A spokesman for the council said: ""The council has no legal obligation to refund fines that have already been paid. The money from the fines has been used to provide essential services for children and young people in Powys."" Other councils, including Denbighshire and Gwynedd, have also said they will not be refunding fines. The Welsh government has said it is ""disappointed"" by the councils' decision not to refund the fines. A spokesman for the government said: ""We believe that it is important that parents are not penalised for taking their children on holiday during term time. We will continue to work with councils to ensure that the fines are refunded."" The decision not to refund the fines has been met with anger from some parents.

'Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir,"Nazi Art Hoarder Gurlitt Makes Swiss Museum Sole Heir Cornelius Gurlitt, the infamous German collector of art looted by the Nazis, has bequeathed his entire trove of 1,500 works to the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland. The announcement, made on Tuesday, comes after years of legal battles and ethical debates over the fate of the collection. Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand, amassed a vast collection of art during the Nazi era, some of which was stolen from Jewish families or acquired under duress. After the war, Hildebrand's collection was hidden away and only rediscovered in 2012 after Cornelius's death. The bequest to the Kunstmuseum Bern has been met with mixed reactions. Some experts welcomed the decision, arguing that the museum has the expertise and resources to properly research and display the works. Others expressed concern that the museum may not be able to fully address the provenance of all the pieces and could potentially legitimize looted art. The Kunstmuseum Bern has stated that it intends to conduct thorough research into the provenance of the collection and make public any findings. The museum also plans to create an online database of the works, providing access to information about their history. The decision to bequeath the collection to Switzerland reflects Cornelius Gurlitt's long-standing ties to the country. He lived in Switzerland for several years and had a Swiss lawyer. Gurlitt's choice may also have been influenced by the Swiss legal system, which is seen as more lenient towards art collectors than some other countries. The legacy of Nazi-looted art remains a complex and sensitive issue. Many works are still missing, and families continue to search for art that was stolen from them. The resolution of the Gurlitt collection is a significant step in addressing this legacy, but it also highlights the challenges of restituting looted art and ensuring that victims of Nazi persecution are properly compensated. Experts estimate that the Gurlitt collection is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It includes works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Marc Chagall. The Kunstmuseum Bern has not yet announced its plans for displaying the collection, but it is expected to go on display in the coming years. The Gurlitt bequest is a reminder of the dark history of art during the Nazi era. It is also a testament to the ongoing struggle to recover and repatriate looted art and to seek justice for victims of Nazi persecution. The Kunstmuseum Bern's decision to accept the collection carries with it a responsibility to address these issues and to ensure that the works are displayed with sensitivity and respect for their history.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Grenfell Tower study: Cancer-causing chemicals found nearby,"Grenfell Tower Study: Cancer-Causing Chemicals Found Nearby A new study has found that cancer-causing chemicals were present in the air near Grenfell Tower in the aftermath of the devastating fire in 2017. The research, published in the journal ""Environmental Science & Technology,"" analyzed air samples taken from the area surrounding the tower in the days and weeks following the blaze. The scientists found high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known carcinogens. PAHs are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic materials, such as wood, coal, and oil. They have been linked to an increased risk of lung, skin, and bladder cancer. The study found that the levels of PAHs in the air near Grenfell Tower were significantly higher than those found in other parts of London. The highest levels were found in the immediate vicinity of the tower, but PAHs were also detected at lower levels in areas several kilometers away. The researchers say that their findings are concerning, as they suggest that residents of the area may have been exposed to harmful levels of PAHs after the fire. ""Our study provides the first evidence of significant PAH exposure in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire,"" said Dr. Thomas Gent, lead author of the study. ""These findings highlight the need for further research to assess the potential health risks to residents."" The study also found that the levels of PAHs in the air decreased over time, as the debris from the fire was removed and the area was cleaned up. However, the researchers say that it is important to continue to monitor the levels of PAHs in the air in the long term, to ensure that they do not pose a health risk to residents. The Grenfell Tower fire was one of the deadliest residential fires in UK history. The blaze claimed the lives of 72 people and destroyed the 24-story tower block. The fire was caused by a faulty refrigerator, and the subsequent inquiry found that the building's cladding was highly flammable and contributed to the spread of the fire. The findings of the new study are likely to add to the concerns of residents who live near Grenfell Tower. Many residents have reported health problems since the fire, including respiratory problems, skin irritation, and cancer. The government has said that it is committed to supporting residents affected by the fire and is working to ensure that the area is safe. However, the findings of the new study suggest that more needs to be done to protect residents from the potential health risks of exposure to PAHs.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The attacks have raised concerns about the state of press freedom in Sri Lanka. The country has a long history of violence against journalists, and the recent attacks have only served to worsen the situation. The UNP's call for an end to the war against the media is a welcome step. It is essential that the government takes action to protect freedom of the press and ensure that journalists can work without fear of reprisal. The media is a vital part of a free and democratic society. It provides information, holds those in power to account, and gives voice to the voiceless. The attacks on the media in Sri Lanka are an attack on democracy itself. The government must take immediate action to end the war against the media. It must investigate the attacks, bring the perpetrators to justice, and adopt measures to protect journalists and media outlets from further violence and intimidation. The UNP's statement is a reminder that the fight for press freedom is not over. It is a fight that must be fought every day, by all those who believe in the importance of a free and independent media.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Yahoo tests ear-based smartphone identification system,"Yahoo Tests Ear-Based Smartphone Identification System Yahoo is trialing a novel method to identify smartphone users based on their unique ear shape. The system, dubbed ""EarID,"" uses advanced algorithms to analyze the contours, shape, and size of a user's ear to create a personalized identification profile. This biometric authentication approach offers several advantages over traditional methods like passwords and PINs. Ears are a relatively permanent physical characteristic that is difficult to alter or disguise. Moreover, EarID can be used in a variety of situations, including when a user's hands are occupied or when they may have forgotten their credentials. To use EarID, users simply take a photo of their ear with their smartphone's camera. The algorithm then extracts a series of biometric features and creates a unique identification profile that is stored securely on the device. When a user attempts to access their smartphone, the EarID system compares the live ear image captured with the stored profile. If the match is successful, the user is granted access without the need to enter any additional credentials. Yahoo has conducted extensive testing of the EarID system, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability. In a recent study involving 2,000 participants, the system achieved an impressive 99% success rate in identifying users. False positives and negatives were rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases. The company believes that EarID has the potential to revolutionize smartphone security and user convenience. It could eliminate the need for passwords and PINs, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and making the user experience more seamless. However, there are also potential privacy concerns to consider. Critics argue that collecting and storing biometric data could pose a risk to user privacy, especially if the data is compromised or falls into the wrong hands. Yahoo has addressed these concerns by implementing strong encryption and privacy safeguards to protect user data. The company also emphasizes that EarID is an opt-in feature, and users have the choice to use or disable the system. As Yahoo continues to test and refine EarID, it remains to be seen whether the system will gain widespread adoption. However, if successful, it could pave the way for a new era of secure and convenient smartphone authentication.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy,"Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy The Weinstein Company, the film studio founded by disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, has filed for bankruptcy. The move comes after months of financial turmoil and legal challenges following a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Monday, March 19, 2018. The filing lists assets of less than $500 million and liabilities of more than $1 billion. The bankruptcy filing is a major setback for the once-successful studio, which has produced films such as ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and ""The King's Speech."" However, the company has been reeling from the fallout of Weinstein's misconduct, which led to his ouster and the subsequent departure of several key executives. The bankruptcy process will allow the company to reorganize its finances and continue operating, while protecting it from creditors. However, it is unclear what the future holds for The Weinstein Company, which is now facing lawsuits from numerous alleged victims of Weinstein's sexual misconduct. The bankruptcy filing also includes a plan to sell off the company's assets, including its film library and other intellectual property. The proceeds from the sale will be used to pay off creditors and alleged victims of Weinstein's misconduct. The Weinstein Company's bankruptcy is a reminder of the consequences of sexual misconduct in the workplace. The allegations against Weinstein have had a profound impact on the company, its employees, and the wider film industry. The bankruptcy filing shows that even the most successful companies can be brought down by the actions of their leaders. The bankruptcy process is likely to be a lengthy and complex one. It will take months, if not years, for the company to reorganize its finances and sell off its assets. The outcome of the bankruptcy will determine the future of The Weinstein Company and the fate of its alleged victims. In the meantime, the bankruptcy filing is a major blow to the legacy of Harvey Weinstein, who was once one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. The filing shows that his actions have had far-reaching consequences and that he will not be able to escape accountability for his alleged misconduct.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

EU and Turkey agreement on deporting migrants and visas,"EU and Turkey Reach Agreement on Deportations and Visas The European Union and Turkey have reached a landmark agreement on the deportation of migrants from Europe to Turkey and the easing of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens. Deportations Under the deal, the EU will deport to Turkey all irregular migrants who cross into Greece or Italy. In return, Turkey will readmit these migrants and provide them with assistance. The agreement also includes a relocation scheme to resettle some of the deported migrants in other EU countries. The deportation plan has been criticized by human rights groups, which argue that it violates the rights of asylum seekers and refugees. However, the EU and Turkey maintain that the agreement is necessary to deter irregular migration and break the business model of human smugglers. Visas As part of the deal, the EU has agreed to ease visa restrictions for Turkish citizens. Turkish citizens will be able to travel to the EU for up to 90 days without a visa, provided they have a valid biometric passport. The visa liberalization move has been welcomed by the Turkish government, which sees it as a sign of closer ties with the EU. However, some EU member states are concerned about the potential for increased migration from Turkey. Reaction The EU-Turkey agreement has been met with mixed reactions. Some EU member states have welcomed the deal, while others have expressed concerns about the deportation provisions. Human rights groups have condemned the agreement as inhumane and illegal. The Turkish government has hailed the agreement as a success, saying it will help to reduce irregular migration and improve relations with the EU. However, it remains to be seen how the agreement will be implemented and how effective it will be in reducing migration flows. Challenges The implementation of the EU-Turkey agreement is likely to face a number of challenges. One challenge will be the identification and deportation of irregular migrants. Another challenge will be the provision of adequate assistance to deported migrants in Turkey. Furthermore, the agreement could strain relations between the EU and Turkey if it is not perceived as fair and effective. The deportation of migrants could also lead to protests and unrest in both Greece and Turkey. Conclusion The EU-Turkey agreement on deportations and visas is a complex and controversial deal. It remains to be seen how the agreement will be implemented and how effective it will be in reducing irregular migration. The deal has the potential to improve relations between the EU and Turkey, but it could also strain relations if it is not perceived as fair and effective.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Austria bans 'hidden' neo-Nazi codes on car number plates,"In a decisive move to combat the resurgence of far-right extremism, Austria has banned the use of neo-Nazi codes on car number plates. This proactive measure aims to curb the subtle display of hateful symbols and prevent their normalization within society. Among the banned codes are those representing the numbers 88 and 14. The former is an abbreviation for ""Heil Hitler,"" as ""H"" is the eighth letter of the alphabet, while the latter stands for the ""Fourteen Words"" white supremacist slogan. Other prohibited codes include combinations of letters and numbers that reference various neo-Nazi groups and ideologies. The ban, implemented by the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, is part of a broader crackdown on extremist symbols and activities in Austria. In recent years, the country has witnessed an alarming rise in hate crimes and far-right propaganda, prompting authorities to take swift action. ""We will not tolerate the use of Nazi symbols or codes in our society,"" said Transport Minister Leonore Gewessler. ""These symbols represent a dark chapter in our history and have no place in modern Austria."" The ban has been met with widespread support from anti-extremism organizations and the general public. Many view it as a necessary step to prevent the spread of hate speech and violence. ""Symbols are powerful, and they can be used to promote dangerous ideologies,"" said Maria Rauch-Kallat, president of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service. ""By banning these codes, we are sending a clear message that we reject intolerance and discrimination in all its forms."" However, some critics argue that the ban may infringe on freedom of expression. They contend that it could lead to the suppression of legitimate historical or cultural symbols. In response, the government has emphasized that the ban is narrowly tailored to target specific neo-Nazi codes that are explicitly used to promote hatred and violence. It does not affect legitimate historical or cultural symbols, such as the use of the number 88 in a non-Nazi context. The ban on neo-Nazi codes on car number plates is a significant step in Austria's ongoing fight against extremism. It sends a powerful message that hateful symbols will not be tolerated and that the country is committed to fostering a society free from intolerance and discrimination.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Beijing tightens controls amid spike in local cases,"Amid a surge in local coronavirus cases, Beijing has implemented stricter control measures to curb the spread of the virus. Authorities have suspended all non-essential business activities, including entertainment venues, cultural institutions, and tourist attractions. Public transport has been reduced, and gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited. The Chinese capital has reported 20 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases since Friday (June 11), the highest daily increase in months. The outbreak is believed to have originated from the Xinfadi wholesale market, which supplies around 90% of Beijing's fresh produce. The market has been closed, and thousands of workers and visitors have been tested. The Beijing government has also ordered mass testing for residents in 11 districts, including those who live near the Xinfadi market. So far, over 100,000 people have been tested, and more than 2,000 people have been placed under quarantine. The new outbreak has raised concerns about a second wave of infections in China. The country has largely brought the virus under control, with only a few sporadic cases reported in recent months. However, the Beijing outbreak shows that the virus can still spread rapidly, even in areas that have previously been successful in containing it. Beijing's strict control measures are aimed at preventing the virus from spreading further. The government has urged residents to stay home as much as possible and to avoid unnecessary travel. People who have recently visited the Xinfadi market or who have come into contact with confirmed cases have been advised to self-isolate. The outbreak has also had a significant impact on Beijing's economy. Many businesses have been forced to close, and tourism has been severely affected. The government has announced a series of financial support measures for businesses and individuals affected by the outbreak. The Beijing outbreak is a reminder that the coronavirus pandemic is not over. Even in countries that have successfully contained the virus, there is still a risk of new outbreaks. It is important to remain vigilant and to follow public health advice to prevent the virus from spreading.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Northern Ireland needs a 'unionism professor',"Northern Ireland Needs a 'Unionism Professor' Northern Ireland's political landscape has long been dominated by the two main traditions of unionism and nationalism. Unionists, who wish to maintain Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom, have traditionally been the largest political bloc. However, recent years have seen a decline in support for unionism, with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) now the largest party in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. This decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including demographic changes, the impact of the Troubles, and the perceived failures of the Good Friday Agreement. However, another factor that has been suggested is the lack of a strong intellectual voice for unionism. While there are a number of academics who identify as unionists, there is no one who holds a professorship in unionism. This is in contrast to nationalism, which has a number of professors who specialize in the subject. This imbalance has led to a situation where the intellectual debate on the future of Northern Ireland is dominated by nationalist voices. The lack of a unionism professorship is a serious problem for a number of reasons. First, it means that there is no one to provide a strong intellectual defense of unionism. This is important, as unionism is often attacked by nationalists and republicans. Without a strong intellectual voice, unionism is vulnerable to being marginalized and dismissed. Second, the lack of a unionism professorship means that there is no one to train the next generation of unionist leaders. This is important, as the future of unionism depends on the ability to attract and develop new talent. Without a professorship in unionism, it will be difficult to do this. Third, the lack of a unionism professorship means that there is no one to provide a bridge between unionism and other sections of society. This is important, as unionism needs to be able to reach out to other communities in order to build support for its cause. Without a professorship in unionism, it will be difficult to do this. The establishment of a unionism professorship is a necessary step for the future of Northern Ireland. It would provide a strong intellectual voice for unionism, train the next generation of unionist leaders, and build bridges between unionism and other sections of society. A number of universities in Northern Ireland would be suitable for hosting a unionism professorship. The University of Ulster, the Queen's University Belfast, and the University of St Andrews all have strong research profiles in areas related to Northern Ireland. The establishment of a unionism professorship would be a positive step for Northern Ireland. It would help to ensure that the intellectual debate on the future of the region is balanced and informed. It would also help to train the next generation of unionist leaders and build bridges between unionism and other sections of society.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Tajikistan special forces chief Gulmurod Khalimov 'joins IS',"Tajikistan special forces chief Gulmurod Khalimov 'joins IS' Gulmurod Khalimov, the former commander of Tajikistan's special forces, has reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video message. In the video, Khalimov is seen wearing a black turban and military fatigues, and is flanked by two masked men. He speaks in Tajik, saying that he has joined IS because he believes it is the only true Islamic state. Khalimov's defection is a major blow to the Tajik government, which has been battling an Islamist insurgency for several years. He is a highly respected military commander, and his decision to join IS is likely to inspire other Tajik fighters to do the same. Khalimov's defection also raises concerns about the growing influence of IS in Central Asia. The group has already established a presence in Afghanistan, and is now seeking to expand its reach into other countries in the region. The Tajik government has condemned Khalimov's defection, and has vowed to hunt him down and bring him to justice. However, it is unclear how effective the government will be in doing so, given IS's growing strength in the region. Khalimov's defection is a reminder of the challenges facing Central Asian governments as they seek to combat the growing threat of Islamist extremism. The region is home to a large number of young, unemployed men who are vulnerable to radicalization, and IS is exploiting this vulnerability to recruit new fighters. The Tajik government is not the only one facing this challenge. Governments across Central Asia are struggling to contain the spread of Islamist extremism, and they are increasingly looking to the international community for help. The United States and other Western countries have provided military and financial assistance to Central Asian governments in their fight against Islamist extremism. However, more needs to be done. The international community needs to provide more support to Central Asian governments, and it needs to do more to address the root causes of radicalization. Unless the international community takes action, the threat of Islamist extremism in Central Asia will continue to grow. And as the threat grows, so too will the risk of instability and violence in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Do India's political parties condone corruption?,"Do India's Political Parties Condone Corruption? Corruption is a pervasive problem in India, affecting all levels of government and society. Political parties play a central role in this issue, both as victims and perpetrators of corruption. Victims of Corruption Political parties often find themselves victims of corruption, as their funds and resources can be misappropriated or used for illegal activities. This can weaken parties, reduce their ability to effectively represent their constituents, and undermine public trust in the political process. Perpetrators of Corruption However, political parties can also be perpetrators of corruption, using their power and influence to benefit themselves or their supporters. This includes bribery, extortion, and nepotism. Such practices can lead to a cycle of corruption that perpetuates and amplifies the problem. Role of Electoral Funding The funding of political parties is a major factor in their involvement in corruption. Many parties rely on illegal sources of income, such as corporate donations or illicit payments from individuals. This can create a situation where parties become beholden to special interests and prioritize their own financial gains over the needs of the public. Lack of Accountability The lack of transparency and accountability in political funding and party operations also contributes to corruption. Political parties are often exempt from regulations and oversight, allowing them to hide their activities and evade responsibility for wrongdoing. Impact on Democracy Political party corruption has a profound impact on Indian democracy. It undermines the integrity of the electoral process, weakens public trust in government, and hinders the country's ability to address other pressing issues. Efforts to Combat Corruption Recognizing the severity of the problem, the Indian government has introduced several measures to combat corruption in political parties. These include: Strengthening anti-corruption laws and increasing penalties for corruption offenses. Establishing independent agencies to investigate and prosecute political corruption. Increasing transparency in party funding and operations. Promoting civil society and media oversight of political parties. Challenges Ahead While these efforts are important steps forward, significant challenges remain in combating corruption in Indian politics. Political parties themselves must commit to ethical practices and transparency. Citizens must actively participate in the electoral process and hold their representatives accountable. And the government must strengthen and enforce anti-corruption laws and regulations. Eradicating political party corruption is a complex and multifaceted task, but it is essential for the long-term health of Indian democracy. By working together, citizens, political parties, and the government can create a more transparent, accountable, and corruption-free political system.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Welsh assembly vote to ban for unstaffed tanning salons,"Welsh Assembly Votes to Ban Unstaffed Tanning Salons The Welsh Assembly has voted to ban unstaffed tanning salons in the country in a bid to protect young people from the dangers of excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. The ban, which is expected to come into effect in 2023, will prohibit tanning salons from operating without a qualified member of staff present. This will ensure that customers are properly supervised and advised on the potential risks of UV exposure. The move has been welcomed by health experts, who have long warned about the dangers of uncontrolled tanning. UV radiation can cause skin damage, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Research has shown that young people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of UV radiation, as their skin is thinner and more easily damaged. The ban on unstaffed tanning salons aims to protect young people from these risks by ensuring that they only use tanning equipment under the supervision of a qualified professional. The Welsh Assembly's decision brings Wales in line with Scotland, which has already banned unstaffed tanning salons. The move has also been backed by the British Medical Association, which has called for a nationwide ban on unstaffed tanning salons. Dr. Philippa Whittlestone, Medical Director of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ""This is a positive step towards protecting people from the dangers of excessive UV radiation exposure. Tanning salons can be particularly harmful to young people, and we are pleased to see Wales taking action to reduce the risks."" The ban on unstaffed tanning salons is part of a wider effort by the Welsh Assembly to promote skin health and prevent skin cancer. The Assembly has also introduced a number of other measures, including: A ban on sunbeds for under-18s A requirement for tanning salons to display health warnings A campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of UV radiation exposure The Welsh Assembly's commitment to protecting people from the dangers of UV radiation exposure is a welcome step. By banning unstaffed tanning salons, the Assembly is sending a clear message that the health and well-being of its citizens is a priority.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The stock has surged in recent weeks, driven by a frenzy of buying from retail investors on platforms such as Reddit. But Belfort, who was jailed for securities fraud in the 1990s, has urged caution. ""This is a classic pump-and-dump scheme,"" he told the BBC. ""It's going to end badly for a lot of people."" GameStop shares have soared by more than 1,000% since the start of the year, as small-time investors have piled into the stock in a bid to drive up the price and squeeze short-sellers. But the rally has been fuelled by hype and speculation, rather than any fundamental changes in the company's business. Belfort, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated film The Wolf of Wall Street, said he was ""amazed"" by the level of enthusiasm for GameStop. ""People are buying this stock because they think it's going to make them rich,"" he said. ""But they're forgetting that all good things come to an end."" Belfort said he believes the GameStop bubble will burst ""sooner rather than later"". ""The stock is already massively overvalued,"" he said.

Military Wives single is 'fastest selling in six years',"Military Wives' Single Becomes Fastest-Selling in Six Years The Military Wives choir's rendition of ""Wherever You Are"" has become the fastest-selling single in the United Kingdom in six years, according to the Official Charts Company. The song, which was released on Friday, November 18, sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, outselling the combined sales of the next 19 songs in the Top 20. It is the first time a military-themed single has reached number one since ""Wherever You Will Go"" by the Calling in 2002. The Military Wives choir is made up of women whose husbands are serving in the British Armed Forces. They were formed in 2010 and have since released two albums and performed at major events around the world, including the Royal Wedding in 2011.

The union said the move would lead to job losses and reduced access to banking services for customers. Lloyds said it was ""disappointed"" by the union's comments and insisted that it had consulted fully with staff and customers. The bank said it was committed to maintaining access to banking services in local communities and that the sale of the branches to the Co-operative Bank would ensure this. However, Unite said the bank's actions had shown a ""complete disregard"" for the interests of staff and customers. The union said it was concerned that the sale of the branches would lead to job losses, with the Co-operative Bank planning to close around 50 of them. Unite also said the sale would reduce access to banking services for customers, particularly in rural areas.

The Co-operative Bank said it was ""committed to providing a wide range of banking services to customers in local communities"". The bank said it would be working with Lloyds to ensure a smooth transition for customers and staff. The sale of the branches is part of a wider plan by Lloyds to reduce its branch network by 150 by 2021.

Gypsy and traveller sites 'neglected' by councils,"Gypsy and traveller sites have been ""neglected"" by councils, with many not meeting basic standards, according to a new report. The study by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that more than a third of local authorities in England had not carried out a needs assessment for Gypsy and traveller sites in the past five years. This has led to a shortage of authorised sites, with many Gypsies and travellers living on unauthorised encampments. The report also found that many authorised sites are in poor condition, with inadequate access to water, sanitation and electricity. This has a negative impact on the health and well-being of Gypsy and traveller communities. The NAO said that councils need to do more to meet the needs of Gypsy and traveller communities. It said that councils should carry out regular needs assessments and develop strategies to meet those needs. It also said that councils should work with Gypsy and traveller communities to design and manage authorised sites. The report comes after the government announced plans to crack down on unauthorised encampments. The government said that it will give councils new powers to evict Gypsy and travellers from unauthorised sites. However, the NAO said that evicting Gypsy and travellers from unauthorised sites will not solve the problem. It said that councils need to provide more authorised sites to meet the needs of Gypsy and traveller communities. The report also highlights the importance of education and employment for Gypsy and traveller communities. It said that councils should work with Gypsy and traveller communities to improve access to education and employment.

The inquest heard that the three of them had discussed the possibility of having a threesome. L/Cpl Everett told the inquest that Cpl Ellement had suggested it, but he had said no. He said: ""She said she wanted to try something different and I said no. I told her I didn't want to and she said, 'Oh come on, it'll be fun'."" Pvt Goswell also told the inquest that Cpl Ellement had discussed having a threesome with her and L/Cpl Everett. She said: ""She said she wanted to try something different and I said I didn't want to. I didn't think it was appropriate."" The inquest heard that Cpl Ellement had been struggling with her mental health in the months leading up to her death. She had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after serving in Northern Ireland. The inquest is expected to last for two weeks.Cpl Anne-Marie Ellement was one of four young recruits to die at Deepcut barracks between 1995 and 2002. The deaths have been the subject of much speculation and controversy, with some claiming that they were the victims of foul play. However, there is no evidence to support these claims and the inquests into their deaths have all concluded that they took their own lives.*",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus lockdown: English Conservative MP's call to scrap Senedd 'wrong',"The call by an English Conservative MP to scrap the Welsh Parliament, the Senedd, has been met with widespread condemnation from Welsh politicians and commentators. David Davies, the Conservative MP for Monmouth, said the Senedd was a ""waste of money"" and that its powers should be devolved to local authorities. ""The Senedd is a talking shop that costs the Welsh taxpayer millions of pounds every year,"" he said. ""It has no real power and its decisions can be overturned by the UK Parliament at any time."" Davies' comments were made in a column for the Daily Telegraph newspaper. He argued that the Senedd was a ""duplication of services"" that was not needed. ""Wales is a small country with a population of just over 3 million people,"" he said. ""We do not need a separate parliament and government. We can be perfectly well governed by our local authorities."" Davies' comments have been met with widespread criticism from Welsh politicians and commentators. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Davies' comments were ""ignorant"" and ""offensive"". ""The Senedd is a democratically elected body that represents the people of Wales,"" he said. ""It is essential for the good governance of our country."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said Davies' comments were ""an insult to the people of Wales"". ""The Senedd is a vital part of our democracy,"" he said. ""It gives the people of Wales a voice in their own affairs."" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he did not agree with his party colleague. ""The Senedd is an important part of the devolution settlement in Wales,"" he said. ""It is essential for the good governance of our country."" The call to scrap the Senedd is not new. It has been made by some English Conservative MPs for many years. However, it has never been supported by the Welsh people. In a poll conducted by YouGov in 2020, 63% of Welsh people said they supported the Senedd. Only 27% said they wanted to scrap it. The Senedd was established in 1999 following a referendum in which 50.3% of Welsh voters voted in favor of devolution. The Senedd has a wide range of powers, including the ability to make laws on a variety of matters, such as education, health, and the environment. The Senedd is also responsible for overseeing the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government is the executive branch of the Welsh Government and is led by the First Minister. The Senedd is a vital part of the devolution settlement in Wales. It gives the people of Wales a voice in their own affairs and ensures that Wales is governed in a way that reflects the needs of its people.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
EU prepares to move two agencies from London,"The European Union is preparing to move two of its agencies from London to other European cities following the UK's departure from the bloc. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) will both be relocated to new headquarters in the coming months. The EMA, which is responsible for the regulation of medicines in the EU, will move to Amsterdam. The EBA, which oversees the banking sector in the EU, will move to Paris. The decision to move the agencies was made by the EU Council in March 2019, following the UK's decision to leave the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The move of the agencies is expected to cost the UK economy around £1 billion. The UK government has said that it will provide financial assistance to businesses that are affected by the move. The move of the agencies has been welcomed by some businesses, which believe that it will help to maintain the UK's access to the EU market. However, other businesses have expressed concerns about the impact that the move will have on their operations. The EMA is one of the most important agencies in the EU. It is responsible for the evaluation and approval of new medicines, as well as the monitoring of the safety of existing medicines. The EBA is responsible for the supervision of the banking sector in the EU. It is responsible for ensuring that banks are sound and well-managed, and for protecting consumers. The move of the EMA and the EBA is a significant step in the process of the UK's departure from the EU. It is a reminder that the UK will no longer be a part of the EU's single market and the EU's regulatory framework. The move of the agencies is also a reminder of the challenges that the UK faces as it prepares to leave the EU. The UK government will need to work closely with the EU to ensure that the move of the agencies is smooth and orderly. The move of the agencies is also a reminder of the importance of the EU. The EU is a major economic and political power, and it is a key player in the global economy. The UK's departure from the EU will have a significant impact on the UK's economy and its place in the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Angelina Jolie gene testing for all?,"Angelina Jolie's Gene Test: A Call for Wider Testing? Following Hollywood star Angelina Jolie's decision to undergo a double mastectomy and removal of her ovaries after testing positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, there has been a global discussion about the potential benefits of gene testing for individuals at risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for DNA repair. Mutations in these genes can increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer significantly. Approximately 1 in 400 women in the US carry the BRCA1 mutation, while 1 in 800 carry the BRCA2 mutation. Risks and Benefits of Gene Testing Gene testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can provide valuable information about an individual's risk of cancer. However, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. Benefits: Identifying individuals at high risk allows for early screening, increased monitoring, and preventive measures such as surgery or medication. Reducing cancer-related anxiety and providing peace of mind for those who test negative. Risks: Positive test results can cause emotional distress and lead to difficult medical decisions. Negative test results may not fully eliminate cancer risk. False positives or negatives can create uncertainty. Expanding Gene Testing Jolie's experience has raised questions about whether gene testing should be more widely available. Some experts argue that all women should be offered the test, regardless of their family history or perceived risk. Others contend that testing should be limited to those with a clear family history or genetic predisposition. Considerations for Wider Testing Expanding gene testing would require significant resources and infrastructure. It would also raise ethical concerns about confidentiality, discrimination, and access to healthcare. Additionally, the psychological impact of positive test results on the general population needs to be carefully considered. Current Recommendations Current guidelines recommend genetic testing for individuals with a personal or strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Genetic counseling is essential before and after testing to help individuals understand the risks, benefits, and implications of the results. Conclusion The decision to undergo gene testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is a complex one that should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional. While Angelina Jolie's experience has heightened awareness of the potential benefits of gene testing, it is important to approach this subject with a balanced perspective, weighing both the risks and benefits before making a decision. Expanding gene testing to the entire population requires careful consideration of ethical, logistical, and psychological factors.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Smart motorway deaths: Safety assurances 'a big job',"Smart motorways have been under scrutiny following a string of fatal accidents. Now, ministers have been warned that their safety assurances are not enough to restore public trust. The Commons Transport Committee said the government had ""failed to adequately respond"" to concerns and that more needed to be done to prevent further deaths. The committee's report comes after a spate of incidents on smart motorways, which have no hard shoulder and use technology to manage traffic flow. In June, a woman and her young son were killed when their car was hit by a lorry on the M1 in Yorkshire. The family of another victim, Jason Mercer, who died on the M40 in Oxfordshire in 2019, have since campaigned for improvements to the roads. The Department for Transport (DfT) has announced a package of measures to improve safety, including more refuge areas and a new average speed camera system. But the Transport Committee said the government's response was ""insufficient"" and that more needed to be done to address the concerns of the public. The committee's chairman, Huw Merriman, said: ""The government has failed to adequately respond to concerns about smart motorways and has not done enough to prevent further tragic deaths."" He added: ""The government must urgently implement our recommendations and do more to reassure the public that smart motorways are safe."" The DfT said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths on smart motorways and that it was committed to improving safety. A spokesperson said: ""We have announced a package of measures to make smart motorways safer, including more refuge areas and a new average speed camera system. ""We will continue to work with Highways England and other partners to improve the safety of our roads."" But the committee's report is likely to add to pressure on the government to take further action. The RAC Foundation said the report ""should serve as a wake-up call"" to the government. Steve Gooding, the RAC Foundation's director, said: ""The government needs to recognise that the public has lost trust in smart motorways and that it needs to do more to reassure people that they are safe."" He added: ""The committee's report is a damning indictment of the government's handling of smart motorways and it is now up to ministers to respond with the urgency that this situation demands.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Employment: North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery,"Employment: North and Midlands Leading Jobs Recovery The North and Midlands regions of the UK are driving the country's economic recovery, with job growth outpacing the national average. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber and the Midlands all saw an increase in employment in the three months to December 2022. The North East saw the highest growth, with employment up by 2.1% compared to the previous quarter. This was followed by the North West (1.9%) and Yorkshire and the Humber (1.7%). The Midlands also performed well, with employment rising by 1.5% in the West Midlands and 1.2% in the East Midlands. In contrast, employment in London fell by 0.5% in the three months to December 2022. This was the only region to see a decrease in employment during this period. The strong jobs growth in the North and Midlands is being driven by a number of factors, including the increased demand for workers in the logistics, manufacturing and construction sectors. The government's ""levelling up"" agenda is also thought to be playing a role, with investment in infrastructure and skills training in these regions. The improvement in employment in the North and Midlands is a welcome boost for the UK economy. These regions have historically lagged behind the South East in terms of economic growth, but the latest figures suggest that this gap is narrowing. The strong jobs growth is also helping to reduce unemployment in these regions. The unemployment rate in the North East fell to 6.0% in the three months to December 2022, the lowest level since 2008. The unemployment rate in the North West also fell to 5.0% in the three months to December 2022, the lowest level since 2005. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said the latest employment figures were ""encouraging news"" and showed that the government's ""levelling up"" agenda was ""making a real difference"". However, he warned that there was still more work to be done to reduce unemployment in the North and Midlands and to ensure that these regions shared in the UK's economic prosperity.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Chevron and Valero's deal to buy Pembroke oil refinery,"Chevron and Valero have agreed to buy the Pembroke oil refinery in Wales from Phillips 66 for $750 million. The deal will see Chevron and Valero become the joint owners of the refinery, which has a capacity of 200,000 barrels per day. The acquisition will give Chevron and Valero a significant presence in the UK refining market. The Pembroke refinery is one of the largest and most complex refineries in Europe, and it is well-positioned to supply the UK market with gasoline, diesel, and other refined products. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approval. Chevron is one of the world's largest energy companies, and it is the second-largest oil producer in the United States. Valero is one of the world's largest independent refiners, and it has a refining capacity of over 3 million barrels per day. The acquisition of the Pembroke refinery will strengthen Chevron and Valero's position in the global refining market. It will also give them a greater presence in the UK, which is one of the world's largest markets for refined products. The deal is a major coup for Chevron and Valero, and it will give them a significant advantage in the UK refining market. It is also a sign of the growing importance of the UK refining sector, which is benefiting from the country's increasing demand for refined products. The acquisition of the Pembroke refinery is a major step forward for Chevron and Valero. It will give them a significant presence in the UK refining market, and it will strengthen their position in the global refining industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Hong Kong police hold rally to support officers jailed for assault,"In a defiant show of support, Hong Kong police officers rallied in the city center on Saturday to denounce the jailing of their colleagues for using excessive force during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. Thousands of officers marched through the streets, chanting slogans and waving blue flags, the color associated with the police force. They condemned the sentences handed down to three officers earlier this week, calling them ""unjust"" and ""politically motivated."" ""We stand with our brothers in blue,"" said one protester, a police sergeant who declined to give his name. ""They were only doing their duty to protect the public and maintain order."" The three officers were convicted of assaulting a protester during an arrest in 2019. Video footage showed the officers repeatedly punching and kicking the man while he was on the ground. The incident sparked outrage among pro-democracy activists, who accused the police of excessive brutality. The officers' convictions were seen as a victory for the movement. However, the rally on Saturday showed that the police still have strong support within the community. Many residents believe the officers were unfairly targeted and that the sentences were too harsh. ""The police are our protectors,"" said one elderly woman who attended the rally. ""We need them to keep our city safe."" The rally also served as a warning to the government not to interfere with the police force. The officers have been under pressure from both the government and pro-democracy activists in recent years. The government has been criticized for not doing enough to support the police, while activists have accused the force of being too heavy-handed. The rally on Saturday showed that the police are not going to be intimidated by either side. They are determined to maintain their independence and continue to serve the community. The jailing of the three officers is likely to further divide Hong Kong society. The government will need to tread carefully to avoid further unrest.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Keith Vaz quits as Home Affairs Committee chairman,"Keith Vaz has resigned as chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee amid an ongoing investigation into his conduct. The announcement came after a recording was published in the Sunday Mirror which appeared to show Mr Vaz offering to buy cocaine for two male escorts. Mr Vaz, who has denied any wrongdoing, said in a statement that he was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""distress and embarrassment"" he had caused. He said he had ""taken the decision to stand down as Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee with immediate effect"". ""I will continue to fully cooperate with the investigation. I will make no further comment at this stage,"" he said. The recording, which was published on Sunday, was made during a meeting between Mr Vaz and two male escorts in August 2016. In the recording, Mr Vaz can be heard saying: ""I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll buy it."" The escorts then ask Mr Vaz how much cocaine he wants to buy, and he replies: ""I'll buy you a gram."" Mr Vaz has previously denied taking drugs, and said he had been ""set up"" by the escorts. The Home Affairs Select Committee is a parliamentary committee that scrutinises the work of the Home Office. Mr Vaz has been chairman of the committee since 2012. The investigation into Mr Vaz's conduct is being carried out by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). IPSA is an independent body that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by MPs. The investigation is ongoing, and it is not yet known when it will be completed.

Unauthorised Julian Assange autobiography due out,"Unauthorized Julian Assange Autobiography Set for Release A tell-all autobiography of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is poised to hit bookshelves despite reportedly being written without his involvement or authorization. Entitled ""Julian Assange: The Man Who Exposed the World's Secrets,"" the book is penned by Gordon Thomas, a former SAS operative turned author, and is set to be published on January 31. Thomas claims he relied on ""extensive research, interviews with key players, and privileged access to classified documents"" to compile the unauthorized biography. However, Assange's representatives have vehemently denounced the project, stating that Thomas never contacted or interviewed their client. The book's release comes at a sensitive time for Assange, who is currently detained in London's Belmarsh Prison and faces extradition to the United States on espionage charges. His legal battles have drawn international attention, with supporters arguing that his prosecution is politically motivated and a threat to press freedom. The unauthorized autobiography promises to delve into Assange's early life, his rise to prominence as the founder of WikiLeaks, and the organization's controversial disclosures of sensitive government and corporate documents. It also addresses the various legal and personal challenges Assange has faced in recent years. While the book's author claims to have presented an objective account, Assange's supporters have expressed concerns that it could further damage his image and prejudice his ongoing legal proceedings. They argue that an unauthorized biography based on secondhand information cannot provide an accurate or fair representation of his life and motivations. The unauthorized autobiography's release has also raised questions about the ethics of publishing a book about someone without their consent, particularly when that individual is facing such significant personal and legal challenges. Some observers have argued that it exploits Assange's current situation for commercial gain. Despite the controversy surrounding its publication, the unauthorized biography of Julian Assange is likely to generate significant interest. Many people are eager to learn more about the enigmatic figure at the center of one of the most high-profile legal cases of our time.

Taylor said: ""The world of work is changing rapidly and we need to make sure that our employment practices are keeping pace. This review will provide an opportunity to take stock of the challenges and opportunities facing workers and businesses, and to make recommendations on how to create a fairer and more prosperous future of work."" The appointment of Taylor to lead the review has been welcomed by business groups and trade unions. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that Taylor was a ""respected figure"" with a ""wealth of experience"" in the field of employment relations. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that it was ""pleased"" that the government had appointed Taylor to lead the review. The review is part of the government's plan to make the UK a ""world leader"" in employment practices.

Trolling forces newspaper to end women's Australian rules comments,"In a bold move to combat the insidious problem of online harassment, The Age newspaper has taken the unprecedented step of closing its comments section on all articles related to women's Australian rules football. The decision comes after a surge in vitriolic and misogynistic trolling targeted at female players and commentators. The closure of the comments section has been met with mixed reactions. While some commend The Age for taking a stand against online abuse, others fear that the move will stifle legitimate debate and criticism. However, the newspaper has maintained that the well-being and safety of its journalists and the players they cover are paramount. Trolling has become an all-too-common occurrence in the digital age, with women being disproportionately targeted. Online harassment can take many forms, including abusive language, threats, and even doxxing (revealing personal information without consent). In the case of women's Australian rules football, trolling has reached unprecedented levels. Female players and commentators have been subjected to a barrage of vile and degrading comments, often focusing on their physical appearance, abilities, and even their personal lives. Such harassment has created a hostile and intimidating environment, deterring women from participating in the sport and sharing their voices. The Age's decision to close its comments section is a clear recognition of the severity of the problem. By removing the platform for trolls, the newspaper hopes to create a safer space for both its journalists and the women they cover. However, it is important to note that this is not a solution to the wider issue of online harassment. Trolling is a symptom of a deeper problem in society. It reflects a culture of misogyny and sexism that needs to be addressed at its root. While closing comments sections may provide a temporary respite, it is not a substitute for long-term solutions. To truly combat online harassment, we need to change the way we view and treat women in society. We need to challenge the underlying assumptions and biases that lead to the perpetuation of misogynistic behavior. We also need to hold accountable those who engage in trolling and other forms of online abuse. The Age's decision is a step in the right direction, but it is only a small part of the solution. To create a truly inclusive and respectful online environment, we all have a responsibility to speak out against harassment and to promote a culture of respect and equality for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

HIV antibodies 'have potent impact',"HIV Antibodies: A Potent Impact HIV antibodies, also known as anti-HIV antibodies, play a crucial role in the body's immune response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These antibodies are produced by the immune system to help neutralize and clear the virus from the body. When a person becomes infected with HIV, their immune system recognizes the virus as a foreign invader and begins producing antibodies against it. These antibodies bind to the surface of HIV particles, preventing them from infecting new cells. The presence of HIV antibodies in the blood indicates that the person has been exposed to the virus. However, it does not necessarily mean that the person is currently infected with HIV. Antibodies can persist in the body for years after the virus has been cleared. Testing for HIV Antibodies HIV testing is recommended for everyone who is sexually active or has shared needles with others. There are several types of HIV tests available, including: Rapid antibody tests: These tests can provide results in as little as 15 minutes. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests: These tests are more sensitive than rapid antibody tests and can detect HIV antibodies sooner after infection. Western blot tests: These tests are used to confirm a positive ELISA test result. Importance of HIV Antibody Testing HIV antibody testing is crucial for: Early diagnosis: Early detection of HIV allows for timely initiation of treatment, which can improve outcomes and prevent the transmission of the virus to others. Monitoring treatment: HIV antibody levels can be monitored over time to assess the effectiveness of treatment and the patient's response to therapy. Preventing transmission: People who know they are HIV-positive can take steps to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their partners and others. Impact of HIV Antibodies on Treatment HIV antibodies can have a potent impact on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is a combination of medications that suppress the virus and reduce the risk of developing AIDS. HIV antibodies can help to: Improve treatment adherence: For some people, knowing they have HIV antibodies can motivate them to take their medication consistently. Reduce the risk of developing drug resistance: HIV antibodies can bind to the virus and prevent it from mutating and becoming resistant to ART medications. Improve the long-term effectiveness of ART: Over time, HIV antibodies can reduce the amount of virus in the body, making it easier for ART to control the infection. Conclusion HIV antibodies are a vital component of the body's immune response to the human immunodeficiency virus. Testing for HIV antibodies is essential for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment, and preventing the transmission of the virus. By understanding the role and impact of HIV antibodies, we can empower individuals to take control of their health and work towards ending the HIV epidemic.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Australia asylum needs military solution, says Tony Abbott","Australia's former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has called for a military solution to the country's asylum seeker crisis. Abbott, who led the country from 2013 to 2015, said that the current system is ""not working"" and that the government needs to take a more aggressive approach to deter people from attempting to reach Australia by boat. Abbott's comments come as the number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat has increased in recent months. In the first half of 2023, more than 1,000 people arrived in Australia by boat, compared to just over 500 in the same period last year. The government has responded to the increase in arrivals by stepping up its border protection efforts. In July, the government announced that it would be increasing the number of naval vessels patrolling the waters around Australia. The government has also said that it will be working with other countries in the region to prevent people from leaving their shores in the first place. Despite the government's efforts, the number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat is expected to continue to increase in the coming months. This is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing conflict in Syria and the political instability in Afghanistan. The government's policy of turning back boats carrying asylum seekers has been criticized by human rights groups. The groups say that the policy is inhumane and that it puts people's lives at risk. The government has defended the policy, saying that it is necessary to deter people from attempting to reach Australia by boat. The debate over asylum seekers is likely to continue in the lead-up to the next federal election. The opposition Labor Party has said that it will review the government's border protection policies if it wins the election.

App tells if office workers are not socially distanced,"App tells if office workers are not socially distanced A new app is being trialled to help office workers maintain social distancing. The app, called Proximity, uses Bluetooth technology to track the distance between people. If two people come within two metres of each other, the app will send them an alert. The app is being trialled by a number of companies, including Microsoft and Google. Microsoft is using the app in its offices in the US and the UK, while Google is using it in its offices in the US and Japan. The app is designed to help companies comply with social distancing guidelines. Many countries have introduced social distancing measures to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. These measures include staying two metres away from other people and avoiding large gatherings. The Proximity app can help companies to ensure that their employees are following these guidelines. The app can also help companies to identify any areas where social distancing is not being maintained. The app is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for companies that are trying to comply with social distancing guidelines. How does the app work? The Proximity app uses Bluetooth technology to track the distance between people. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that is used to connect devices such as phones, laptops, and headphones. When two devices with Bluetooth enabled are in close proximity, they will exchange data. The Proximity app uses this data to track the distance between people. If two people come within two metres of each other, the app will send them an alert. The alert will be sent to both people's phones. What are the benefits of using the app? The Proximity app can help companies to comply with social distancing guidelines. The app can also help companies to identify any areas where social distancing is not being maintained. The app can also help to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. By ensuring that people are staying two metres apart, the app can help to reduce the number of close contacts that people have. What are the challenges of using the app? One challenge of using the Proximity app is that it requires all employees to have Bluetooth enabled on their phones. If an employee does not have Bluetooth enabled, the app will not be able to track their distance from other people. Another challenge is that the app may not be able to track the distance between people in all situations. For example, the app may not be able to track the distance between people who are in different rooms or who are separated by a wall. Overall, the Proximity app is a promising tool that can help companies to comply with social distancing guidelines and reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed before the app can be widely adopted.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
China's Luckin Coffee slumps on 'fake' data news,"China's Luckin Coffee stock has plunged more than 75% in pre-market trading after reports emerged that its chief operating officer (COO) Shaolei Liu and other employees fabricated sales data. The allegations, first reported by short-seller Muddy Waters, sent shockwaves through the coffee chain's investors and raised concerns about the company's accounting practices. Luckin has denied the allegations, calling them ""false and malicious."" The company said in a statement that it had hired an independent committee to investigate the matter. It also said that it was ""committed to transparency and accuracy in its financial reporting."" If the allegations are true, they would represent a major setback for Luckin, which has been seen as a rising star in China's coffee market. The company has been aggressively expanding in recent years, opening hundreds of new stores and challenging Starbucks' dominance. Luckin's stock has been one of the best performers on the Nasdaq this year, rising more than 200% before the allegations emerged. However, the company's shares have now lost more than half of their value. The allegations against Luckin come at a time when Chinese companies are facing increased scrutiny from investors and regulators. In recent months, several Chinese companies have been accused of accounting fraud and other financial irregularities. The Luckin scandal is likely to further damage the reputation of Chinese companies and make it more difficult for them to raise capital in the future. It could also lead to increased regulation of the coffee industry in China. The allegations against Luckin have also raised questions about the company's business model. Luckin has relied heavily on subsidies and discounts to attract customers, which has raised concerns about its long-term profitability. If the allegations are true, they would suggest that Luckin's growth has been built on a foundation of deception. This could damage the company's reputation and make it more difficult to attract new customers in the future. The Luckin scandal is a major setback for the company and for the Chinese coffee industry. It is still too early to say what the long-term consequences will be, but the allegations have raised serious questions about the company's business practices and the future of the Chinese coffee market.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'Short-sighted' Borders Railway vision claims denied,"Short-sighted' Borders Railway vision claims denied Plans to expand the Borders Railway to Carlisle have been branded ""short-sighted"" by Scottish Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell. Mr Mundell said the Scottish government's vision for the line was ""limited"" and failed to take into account the potential for economic growth in the area. But Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the government was committed to investing in the Borders Railway and that plans were in place to extend the line to Hawick and Newcastleton. Mr Mundell said: ""The Scottish government's vision for the Borders Railway is short-sighted. Their plans to extend the line to Hawick and Newcastleton are welcome, but they fail to take into account the potential for economic growth in the area. ""Extending the line to Carlisle would open up the Borders to new markets and create jobs. It would also improve connectivity between Scotland and England, and make it easier for people to travel between the two countries. ""The Scottish government needs to think bigger and bolder when it comes to the Borders Railway. They need to have a vision for the line that will benefit the people of the Borders for generations to come."" Mr Yousaf said: ""The Scottish government is committed to investing in the Borders Railway. We have already invested £294 million in the line and we are currently working on plans to extend the line to Hawick and Newcastleton. ""We are also working with partners to explore the possibility of extending the line to Carlisle. However, this is a complex project that will require significant investment and we need to ensure that it is viable before we can commit to it. ""We believe that our plans for the Borders Railway will deliver significant economic benefits to the area. The line will improve connectivity between the Borders and the rest of Scotland, and it will make it easier for businesses to access new markets. ""We are committed to working with partners to deliver the full potential of the Borders Railway."" The Borders Railway was opened in 2015 and runs from Edinburgh to Tweedbank. The line has been a success, with passenger numbers exceeding expectations. The Scottish government has pledged to invest £120 million in the line over the next five years. This investment will be used to improve the line's infrastructure and to extend the line to Hawick and Newcastleton. The extension of the line to Carlisle is a longer-term goal. The Scottish government is currently working with partners to explore the possibility of this extension.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Armenia 'ready' for ceasefire talks,"Armenia has said it is ready to resume peace talks over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said his country was committed to finding a ""peaceful and lasting solution"". His statement comes after Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said he was ready to meet Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan ""without preconditions"". The two leaders last met in Brussels in December, when they agreed to work towards a peace treaty. However, talks have since stalled over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians. The conflict over the region has simmered for decades and has claimed the lives of thousands of people. In 2020, a six-week war between Armenia and Azerbaijan ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire. Since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence along the border between the two countries. The latest fighting erupted in August, when Armenia accused Azerbaijan of shelling its positions. Azerbaijan said it was responding to Armenian provocations. The fighting has raised fears of a wider conflict in the region. The United States, Russia and France have all called for an end to the violence and have urged both sides to resume peace talks. In his statement, Mirzoyan said Armenia was ""ready to continue negotiations without preconditions"". He said his country was committed to ""finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict"". Aliyev has also said he is ready to meet Pashinyan ""without preconditions"". However, he has also said that Azerbaijan will not give up its claim to Nagorno-Karabakh. It remains to be seen whether the two leaders will be able to overcome their differences and reach a peace agreement. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is a complex and long-standing issue. There is no easy solution and it will require compromise from both sides. The international community has a role to play in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The United States, Russia and France have all been involved in mediation efforts and they should continue to play a role in bringing the two sides together.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Voting referendum question 'too hard', says watchdog","The Electoral Commission has said the question on the ballot paper for the upcoming referendum on the voting system is ""too hard"" to understand. The watchdog has written to the government expressing its concerns about the wording of the question, which asks voters: ""Do you want the UK to adopt a system of proportional representation for elections to the House of Commons?"" The commission said the question was ""complex and technical"" and that many voters would struggle to understand what it meant. It also said the question was biased in favor of a ""yes"" vote, because it presented proportional representation as the only alternative to the current first-past-the-post system. The government has defended the wording of the question, saying it is clear and concise. It also said the question was not biased, because it simply presented the two options to voters without expressing any preference for either one. However, the Electoral Commission's concerns have been echoed by some politicians and campaign groups. The Labour Party has said the question is ""confusing and misleading"", while the Liberal Democrats have said it is ""unfair and biased"". The referendum is due to take place on May 7th. It is the first time that voters in the UK have been asked to vote on a change to the voting system since 1997. The current first-past-the-post system means that the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, even if they do not have the support of a majority of voters. This system has been criticized for producing unrepresentative results, as it is possible for a party to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons with less than 50% of the vote. Proportional representation is a system in which seats in the House of Commons are allocated to parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive. This system is used in many other countries around the world, including Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. The referendum is a chance for voters to decide whether they want to keep the current first-past-the-post system or adopt a system of proportional representation. The result of the referendum is not binding on the government, but it is likely to influence the government's decision-making on electoral reform.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
The battle for nesting sites among the birds and the bees,"In the vibrant tapestry of nature, the arrival of spring heralds an intense battle for nesting sites among the realm's feathered and buzzing inhabitants. Birds, with their melodious calls and intricate courtship displays, embark on a fierce competition to secure the most suitable nesting spots. For many avian species, cavities in trees provide much-needed shelter and protection from predators. Woodpeckers, with their remarkable beaks, tirelessly excavate their own nests, while other cavity-nesting birds, like bluebirds and chickadees, must search for abandoned cavities. This competition often leads to territorial disputes and aggressive encounters between rival pairs. Tree cavities are not the only prize in the nesting site battleground. Birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, seek out lofty perches to build their nests. These nests, composed of twigs and other materials, provide a clear vantage point for hunting and surveillance. To secure these coveted locations, birds of prey engage in aerial battles, soaring and diving to establish dominance over their chosen nesting sites. Meanwhile, among the buzzing ranks of insects, the search for nesting sites is equally intense. Bees, nature's industrious pollinators, are known for their elaborate honeycomb structures, built from wax secreted from their bodies. For solitary bees, finding an appropriate nesting site is crucial for the survival of their offspring. They may seek out holes in the ground or crevices in rocks, meticulously lining these cavities with pollen and nectar to provide nourishment for their developing larvae. The competition for nesting sites extends beyond birds and bees. Small mammals, such as squirrels and mice, also seek shelter in available cavities. This creates an intricate web of interactions, with different species vying for the same resources. In some cases, cooperation arises amidst the competition, as birds and small mammals may share nest cavities, forming an unlikely alliance for mutual benefit. The battle for nesting sites is a testament to the fierce reproductive drive that fuels the natural world. For birds and bees, securing a suitable nesting site is essential for the continuation of their species. It is a battle that showcases the remarkable strategies and adaptations that have evolved over millennia, ensuring the survival of these captivating creatures in the face of intense competition.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

David Cameron: UK must defend Christian values against terror,"In a passionate address to the General Synod of the Church of England, former Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the country to boldly defend its Christian values against the threat of terrorism. Cameron, who served as Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016, warned that the UK faces a ""generational struggle"" against those who seek to undermine its way of life. ""We must not be afraid to stand up for what we believe in,"" Cameron declared. ""The values that have shaped our nation for centuries – including our Christian heritage – are under attack, and we must not let them be eroded."" Cameron's speech comes at a time of heightened tensions following a series of terrorist attacks in the UK. In recent months, the country has witnessed the Manchester Arena bombing, the London Bridge attack, and the Parsons Green tube bombing. These attacks have left many Britons feeling vulnerable and uncertain. In his address, Cameron acknowledged the fears and concerns of the public. However, he urged against giving in to despair or division. Instead, he called for a renewed commitment to the values that have made the UK a ""great and tolerant nation."" ""We must not allow the terrorists to divide us,"" Cameron said. ""They want to pit us against each other, to turn us against our neighbors. But we must not let them succeed. We are a country that stands together, united in our determination to defend our way of life."" Cameron's speech was met with a standing ovation from the General Synod. Many attendees expressed their agreement with his message and pledged to do their part to uphold Christian values in the face of adversity. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said that Cameron's words had been ""a timely and important reminder of the values that we must never abandon."" ""We must not be afraid to speak out for what is right,"" Welby said. ""We must not be afraid to stand up for our beliefs, even when they are challenged. The future of our country depends on it."" Cameron's speech is likely to resonate with many Britons who are concerned about the threat of terrorism. It is a reminder that the UK is a nation with a strong and proud heritage, and that it must not be afraid to defend its values against those who seek to destroy them.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Children 'hid in attic' during Raoul Moat shootings,"Children 'hid in attic' during Raoul Moat shootings Former Northumbria Police officer Raoul Moat went on a shooting spree in July 2010, killing ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and her new partner Chris Brown, and seriously injuring PC David Rathband. During the manhunt for Moat, three children were forced to hide in an attic for three days as he roamed the area. The youngsters, aged between seven and 12, were terrified after hearing gunshots and seeing armed police in their street. The children's father told the BBC: ""We live in a quiet street and we never expected anything like this to happen. It all started when we heard gunshots and saw armed police running down the street. We didn't know what was going on and we were terrified. We told the children to go and hide in the attic and we locked the door. We then spent the next three days huddled together in the attic, listening to the police searching for Moat."" He said his children were ""traumatized"" by the experience. ""They were terrified and they didn't understand what was going on. We tried to keep them calm, but it was difficult. They kept asking when it would be safe to come out and we didn't know what to tell them."" He said the family was ""relieved"" when Moat was finally caught and killed. ""We knew he was dangerous and we were worried that he would come after us. We're just glad that it's all over now and that we can start to move on with our lives."" Moat's rampage began on July 3, 2010, when he shot dead Ms. Stobbart, 22, and Mr. Brown, 29, at their home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. He then went on the run and a massive manhunt was launched. During the manhunt, Moat shot and seriously injured PC Rathband in Newcastle city center. He then fled to Rothbury, Northumberland, where he was eventually cornered by police. Following a six-hour stand-off, Moat was shot and killed by a police marksman.

January Tube strike talks end with 'no progress',"January Tube strike talks end with 'no progress' Talks between London Underground and the RMT union have ended without agreement, meaning a strike by Tube drivers on the Central and Victoria lines is still set to go ahead on 10 January. The RMT said there had been ""no progress"" in negotiations over pay, pensions and working conditions. London Underground said it was ""disappointed"" that the talks had not led to a resolution. The strike will affect the Central and Victoria lines, which are two of the busiest on the Tube network. The RMT said it had been ""forced"" to call the strike after London Underground ""failed to address our concerns"". The union said it was seeking a pay increase of 6.5%, a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies, and a 35-hour week. London Underground said it had offered a pay increase of 4.5%, which it said was ""fair and reasonable"". The company also said it had made a number of other concessions, including a commitment to no compulsory redundancies for the next two years. However, the RMT said these concessions were not enough. The strike will cause significant disruption to travel in London. Passengers are advised to check before they travel and consider using alternative routes. London Underground is running a reduced service on the Central and Victoria lines, but there are severe delays and some stations are closed. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial disputes on the Tube network.

Charity warns officer cuts leave prison system 'in crisis',"Charity warns officer cuts leave prison system 'in crisis' Prisons are facing a ""crisis"" due to a shortage of staff, a charity has warned. The Prison Reform Trust said the number of prison officers in England and Wales has fallen by 10% since 2010, with further cuts planned. The charity said this is leading to increased violence, disorder and self-harm in prisons. The Ministry of Justice said it was working to recruit more prison officers and that the prison population had fallen by 6% since 2010. However, the Prison Reform Trust said the cuts were having a ""devastating impact"" on prisons. It said that in some prisons, officers are being asked to work 12-hour shifts with no breaks. This is leading to fatigue and stress, which is increasing the risk of assaults on staff and prisoners. The charity also said that the cuts are making it more difficult to provide rehabilitation for prisoners. This is because officers are having to spend more time on security and less time on working with prisoners. As a result, the charity said, the prison system is ""in crisis"". Peter Clarke, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""The government's cuts to prison officer numbers are having a devastating impact on our prisons. ""Prisons are becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, and prisoners are being denied the rehabilitation they need to turn their lives around. ""The government needs to act now to recruit more prison officers and to invest in rehabilitation. Otherwise, our prisons will continue to be in crisis."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are working to recruit more prison officers and the prison population has fallen by 6% since 2010. ""We are also investing in rehabilitation, with £40 million being spent on new and improved resettlement prisons.""

The tweet, which was quickly removed, has been attributed to an extreme Reddit user who gained access to CNN's account through a phishing scam. The user, known as ""u/AbusiveAccount,"" is known for their history of posting inflammatory and offensive comments on Reddit. They have been banned from the platform multiple times but have continued to create new accounts. In a statement, CNN confirmed that their account had been compromised and that the ""CNN Wrestling"" tweet was not authorized. The network said it was investigating the incident and taking steps to secure its accounts. The incident has raised concerns about the security of social media accounts and the potential for malicious actors to gain access to them. It also highlights the importance of using strong passwords and being aware of phishing scams. Phishing is a type of online fraud in which scammers send emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate organizations. These messages often contain links to fake websites that look like the real thing. If you click on the link and enter your login information, the scammers will be able to access your account. There are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from phishing scams: Never click on links in emails or text messages from people you don't know. Be wary of emails or text messages that ask you to provide personal information, such as your password or credit card number. If you're not sure whether an email or text message is legitimate, contact the organization directly. In the case of the CNN Wrestling tweet, it is unclear how the user gained access to the network's account. However, it is possible that they used a phishing scam to obtain the login information. CNN has since taken steps to secure its accounts and has advised its followers to be aware of phishing scams. The network also said it would be working with law enforcement to investigate the incident. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of online security and the need to be vigilant against phishing scams.

The Anfield memorial is a bronze statue of the Shankly Gates, which were the entrance to the stadium at the time of the disaster. The statue is inscribed with the names of the 97 victims. The Goodison Park memorial is a stone plinth with a bronze plaque inscribed with the names of the 97 victims. The plinth is located in the Gwladys Street Stand, which was where many of the victims were standing when the disaster happened. The memorials were unveiled by Liverpool and Everton players, as well as family members of the victims. The Hillsborough disaster was a tragic event that occurred on 15 April 1989, when a crowd crush at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. The disaster was caused by a combination of factors, including overcrowding and a lack of police control. The Taylor Report, which was commissioned by the government in the wake of the disaster, found that the police had been negligent in their handling of the crowd. The report also recommended a number of changes to the way that football matches were organized, including the introduction of all-seater stadiums. The Hillsborough disaster had a profound impact on the city of Liverpool. The memorials that have been unveiled today will serve as a permanent reminder of the tragedy and the lives that were lost. The memorials will also be a place for families and friends of the victims to come and remember their loved ones. The unveiling of the memorials is a significant moment in the history of Liverpool.

Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad's Nazi ties 'went deeper',"Ikea Founder Ingvar Kamprad's Nazi Ties 'Went Deeper' Swedish furniture giant Ikea's late founder Ingvar Kamprad had deeper ties to the Nazi Party than previously known, according to a new book. Kamprad, who died in 2018, joined the fascist New Swedish Movement at the age of 18 and remained a member for two years. He also wrote letters praising Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who he described as ""a great man"". The extent of Kamprad's Nazi sympathies has been the subject of scrutiny for decades. In 1994, he apologized for his past actions, saying he had been ""naive"" and ""stupid"". However, a new book by Swedish author Elisabeth Åsbrink claims that Kamprad's Nazi ties went further than previously believed. Åsbrink alleges that Kamprad was not only a member of the New Swedish Movement, but also a member of the Nazi Party itself. She also claims that Kamprad helped to smuggle Nazi propaganda into Sweden during World War II. Ikea has not commented on the allegations made in Åsbrink's book. However, the company has previously acknowledged Kamprad's Nazi past and expressed regret for his actions. The revelations about Kamprad's Nazi ties have come as a shock to many. Ikea is a global brand that is known for its affordable and stylish furniture. The company's association with Nazism has raised questions about its corporate culture and values. Some critics have called for Ikea to take steps to distance itself from its founder's past. Others have argued that the company should focus on its present and future, rather than dwelling on its history. The debate over Ikea's Nazi past is likely to continue for some time. The revelations about Kamprad's involvement have reopened old wounds and raised important questions about the company's identity. It remains to be seen how Ikea will respond to these challenges and whether it will be able to move forward from its founder's dark legacy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"Global executions fall to lowest level in a decade, Amnesty says","Global executions have fallen to the lowest level in a decade, with a significant decline in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty International. The organization's annual report on the death penalty found that at least 483 people were executed in 18 countries in 2022, down from 539 in the previous year. This represents a 10.4% decrease and the lowest number of executions recorded by Amnesty since 2013. ""This decline is a welcome step forward in the global fight to end the use of the death penalty,"" said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary General. ""It shows that even the most repressive governments are beginning to realize that the death penalty is not a solution, but a violation of human rights."" The report highlights several factors that have contributed to the decline in executions. One is the growing international consensus against the death penalty. In recent years, several countries have abolished capital punishment, including Sierra Leone, Chad, and Kazakhstan. Additionally, international bodies like the United Nations and the European Union have repeatedly called for an end to executions. Another factor is the increasing availability of DNA testing and other forensic technologies. These advances have led to a number of wrongful convictions being overturned, which has raised concerns about the reliability of the death penalty. In addition to the overall decline in executions, the report also found that some countries have made significant progress in reducing their use of the death penalty. For example, Iran, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world, executed 251 people in 2022, down from 314 in the previous year. This decline is largely due to changes in the country's drug laws, which have reduced the number of people sentenced to death for drug-related offenses. Saudi Arabia, another country with a high execution rate, also saw a decline in executions in 2022. The country executed 147 people, down from 184 in the previous year. This decline is thought to be due to the country's de facto moratorium on executions that was imposed in November 2020. Despite the progress that has been made, the report also highlights the challenges that remain in the fight to end the death penalty. In some countries, use of the death penalty is increasing, such as in Egypt, which executed 83 people in 2022, up from 43 in the previous year. Additionally, some countries continue to use the death penalty for a wide range of offenses, including political crimes and apostasy. Amnesty International called on all countries to abolish the death penalty, saying that it is ""a cruel and inhumane punishment that has no place in the 21st century."" ""The death penalty is not a deterrent to crime, it does not provide closure to victims' families, and it does not make societies safer,"" said Callamard. ""It is time for all countries to end this barbaric practice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Bank of Mum and Dad 'feels the pinch',"In the midst of the cost-of-living crisis, the ""Bank of Mum and Dad"" is facing unprecedented strain. The soaring cost of living has left many young adults struggling to make ends meet, forcing them to turn to their parents for financial support. A recent study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) found that the average amount of financial assistance provided by parents to their children has increased by 15% in the past year, to a record £2,000. This is putting a significant burden on many parents, who are also grappling with rising costs and reduced incomes. Emma Jones, CEO of Enterprise Nation, a small business support network, says: ""Parents are increasingly having to step in and provide financial support to their children. This is a worrying trend, as it can put a strain on relationships and lead to resentment on both sides."" One in four young adults aged 18-34 now rely on their parents for financial support, according to the survey. This is a significant increase from the one in five reported in 2021. The study also found that the average age at which young adults become financially independent has increased to 27, up from 25 in 2021. The rising cost of housing is a major factor driving the increase in parental support. The average house price in the UK has increased by more than 10% in the past year, making it increasingly difficult for young people to afford to buy their own homes. Rents have also been rising rapidly, making it more expensive for young people to rent privately. This is leaving many young adults with no choice but to live with their parents or other family members. The cost-of-living crisis is not just affecting young people. Many older people are also struggling to make ends meet. The CEBR study found that the number of over-65s relying on their children for financial support has increased by 10% in the past year. This is a worrying trend, as it suggests that the cost-of-living crisis is having a wider impact on society. It is essential that the government takes action to address the rising cost of living and help those who are struggling to make ends meet.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Niels Högel: German ex-nurse convicted of killing 85 patients,"Niels Högel, a former nurse in Germany, has been convicted of murdering 85 patients in his care. Högel was found guilty of administering lethal doses of medication to patients at two hospitals in Oldenburg and Delmenhorst between 1999 and 2005. The court heard that Högel deliberately targeted vulnerable patients who were close to death or who had serious illnesses. He would inject them with drugs such as ajmaline and potassium, which would cause their hearts to stop. Högel initially denied the charges but later confessed to killing the patients. He said he did it out of boredom and a desire to play the role of a ""savior"" by ending their suffering. The court rejected Högel's claims that he was motivated by mercy, saying that he had acted out of a ""base motive"" of self-gratification. The judge said that Högel had shown ""no remorse or empathy"" for his victims. Högel's conviction is one of the worst cases of serial killing in German history. The case has shocked the country and raised questions about how such a thing could have happened in a modern healthcare system. Högel's crimes were only discovered after he was caught trying to kill a patient in 2005. He was immediately arrested and charged with attempted murder. During the investigation, police found evidence that he had killed dozens of other patients. Högel's trial began in 2015 and lasted for more than two years. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Högel had killed at least 85 patients. They also presented evidence that Högel had attempted to kill several other patients. Högel was found guilty of 85 counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The case of Niels Högel is a reminder of the importance of trust in the healthcare system. Patients must be able to trust that the people who are caring for them are acting in their best interests. Högel's crimes have shattered that trust.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Australia climate change: Thousands rally in Sydney amid bushfires,"Thousands of people have rallied in Sydney to demand urgent action on climate change, as devastating bushfires continue to burn across Australia. The protesters marched through the city centre, chanting slogans and carrying placards that read ""Climate Action Now"" and ""Stop Adani"". The rally was organised by a coalition of environmental groups, including the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Greenpeace Australia Pacific and the Nature Conservation Council. Speakers at the rally included Aboriginal elder Uncle Warren Mundine, who spoke about the impact of climate change on Indigenous communities. ""We are the traditional owners of this land, and we have a responsibility to protect it,"" he said. ""Climate change is a threat to our culture, our way of life and our future."" Other speakers included climate scientist Professor Will Steffen, who warned that Australia is facing ""a climate emergency"". ""The fires we are seeing now are a wake-up call,"" he said. ""We need to take urgent action to reduce our emissions and transition to a clean energy future."" The rally comes as Australia continues to grapple with the devastating effects of bushfires. So far, the fires have killed at least 25 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. The fires have also caused widespread damage to the environment, killing millions of animals and destroying vast tracts of bushland. The government has been criticised for its response to the fires, with many people accusing it of not doing enough to address climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that the government is ""doing everything we can"" to fight the fires, but he has also been criticised for his support for the coal industry. The rally in Sydney is part of a growing movement of people around the world who are demanding action on climate change. In recent months, there have been large protests in cities across Europe, Asia and North America. The protests have been sparked by the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts. The protests are a clear sign that people are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of action on climate change. Governments around the world need to listen to the demands of their citizens and take urgent action to reduce emissions and transition to a clean energy future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Star Wars: In defence of the prequels from 1999 to 2005,"Amidst the sprawling cinematic tapestry of ""Star Wars,"" the prequel trilogy (1999-2005) often finds itself mired in controversy. Detractors denounce it for its clunky dialogue, wooden acting, and excessive use of CGI. However, a closer examination reveals that beneath the surface flaws lies a saga that is both ambitious and deeply resonant. Political Intrigue and Technological Evolution The prequels delve into the political complexities that led to the rise of the Galactic Empire. The Republic, once a beacon of democracy, becomes embroiled in a web of corruption and manipulation. The rise of the Trade Federation and the Separatist movement reflects real-world concerns about globalism, corporate power, and the erosion of democratic ideals. Moreover, the prequels explore the technological evolution of the ""Star Wars"" universe. The gleaming starfighters, vast droid armies, and towering battleships represent a leap forward from the iconic ships and weapons of the original trilogy. While some may find the CGI overwhelming, it allows for breathtaking visual spectacles that push the boundaries of filmmaking. Character Development and Redemption While the performances in the prequels may not always be stellar, the characters themselves are complex and relatable. Anakin Skywalker, the central figure, is not simply a one-dimensional villain but a tragic hero whose descent into darkness is both heartbreaking and understandable. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise and enigmatic mentor, grapples with the weight of responsibility and the challenges of teaching his wayward apprentice. Padmé Amidala, the queen-turned-senator, embodies strength, compassion, and the enduring hope in the face of adversity. Thematic Depth Beyond the action and adventure, the prequels explore profound themes that resonate with audiences of all ages. The struggle between good and evil, the dangers of unchecked power, and the importance of choice are woven throughout the narrative. Moreover, the prequels offer insights into the nature of prophecy and destiny. Anakin is often portrayed as the ""Chosen One"" destined to bring balance to the Force, but his journey teaches us that prophecy is not always straightforward and that personal choices ultimately shape one's destiny. Legacy and Impact Despite their initial mixed reception, the prequels have had a lasting impact on the ""Star Wars"" franchise. They introduced beloved characters such as Darth Maul and General Grievous, expanded the lore of the universe, and provided a backstory for the original trilogy. Furthermore, the prequels have inspired a new generation of fans and filmmakers, who have embraced the darker and more complex elements of the ""Star Wars"" mythology. From the animated series ""The Clone Wars"" to the recent ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" miniseries, the prequels have left an indelible mark on the franchise's history. In conclusion, while the ""Star Wars"" prequels may not be perfect, they offer a compelling and thought-provoking addition to the beloved saga. With their political intrigue, technological advancements, complex characters, and profound themes, the prequels deserve a second look and a more nuanced appreciation for their contributions to the ""Star Wars"" universe.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Greg Clark stands by refusal to publish Nissan letter,"Business Secretary Greg Clark has defended his refusal to publish a letter from Nissan warning of the potential impact of Brexit on its Sunderland plant. In a letter to the Commons' Brexit Committee, Clark said that the letter contained ""confidential commercial information"" and that publishing it would ""harm Nissan's commercial interests"". However, the committee has said that it is ""disappointed"" by Clark's decision and has called on him to reconsider. The letter from Nissan, which was sent to the government in January, warned that the company could be forced to cut production at its Sunderland plant if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The plant is Nissan's biggest in Europe and employs around 7,000 people. Clark said that he had ""carefully considered"" the request from the committee but that he had concluded that it would not be in the public interest to publish the letter. He said that the letter contained ""detailed and sensitive information"" about Nissan's business plans and that publishing it would ""give our competitors an unfair advantage"". Clark also said that he had met with Nissan executives on several occasions to discuss the company's concerns about Brexit. He said that the government was ""working closely with Nissan to support their business in the UK"" and that he was confident that the company would continue to invest in the country. However, the Brexit Committee said that it was ""disappointed"" by Clark's decision and has called on him to reconsider. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said that the letter was ""clearly in the public interest"" and that the public had a right to know what Nissan had said to the government. Benn said that the committee would ""continue to press the government to publish the letter"" and that it would ""consider all options available to it"" to ensure that the letter is published. The government has said that it is ""committed to transparency"" but that it also has a duty to protect confidential information. A government spokesperson said that the government was ""always happy to share information with the committee"" but that it had to ""balance that with our duty to protect sensitive information"".",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Cost overtakes green concerns in electric car debate,"Cost overtakes green concerns in electric car debate The rising cost of living is causing consumers to prioritize affordability over environmental concerns when considering electric vehicles (EVs). A recent survey found that 60% of respondents are now more likely to purchase a gasoline-powered car due to the high cost of EVs. This is a significant increase from just 40% last year. The average price of a new EV has risen by 20% in the past year, while the price of gasoline has remained relatively stable. This has made EVs less affordable for many consumers. In addition, the availability of government incentives for EVs has declined in recent months. This has also made EVs less attractive to consumers. As a result of these factors, the growth of the EV market is expected to slow in the coming years. In 2022, EVs accounted for just 5% of new car sales. This is expected to rise to only 10% by 2025. The shift away from EVs is a major setback for the fight against climate change. EVs are zero-emission vehicles, which means they do not produce any harmful pollutants. This makes them an important part of the transition to a clean energy future. However, the high cost of EVs is a major barrier to adoption. If the cost of EVs does not come down soon, the growth of the EV market will continue to be slow. There are a number of things that can be done to make EVs more affordable. Governments can provide more financial incentives for EVs. Car manufacturers can also reduce the cost of producing EVs. Until the cost of EVs comes down, consumers will continue to prioritize affordability over environmental concerns. This will make it difficult to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Covid: 'I’m one of those people who’s been left out',"In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world has been grappling with its far-reaching consequences. While many have been fortunate enough to regain a sense of normalcy, there are those who have been left behind, their lives irrevocably altered. Among them is Sarah, a 35-year-old mother of two. Before the pandemic, she worked as a physiotherapist, enjoying a fulfilling career and a happy family life. But when the virus struck, everything changed. ""My husband and I both got sick,"" she recalls. ""It was a horrible time. I had a fever, chills, and a cough that just wouldn't go away."" As the days turned into weeks, Sarah's symptoms persisted. She was unable to work, and the family's finances took a heavy toll. But it was the lingering effects of the virus that would prove to be the most devastating. ""Even after I recovered from the initial infection, I still had this terrible fatigue,"" she says. ""I couldn't get out of bed some days, and even simple tasks like walking up the stairs left me exhausted."" Sarah's symptoms fit the constellation of conditions known as ""long Covid."" Experts believe it may affect up to 10% of people who have had Covid-19, with symptoms that can include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, and muscle pain. For Sarah, the impact of long Covid has been profound. She has been unable to return to work, and her family has had to rely on her husband's income. The financial strain has been stressful, and Sarah worries about the future. ""I feel like I've been left out of the recovery,"" she says. ""Everyone else seems to be moving on, but I'm still stuck here, struggling with these symptoms."" Sarah's story is not an isolated one. Millions around the world are living with the lingering effects of Covid-19. Some have been able to manage their symptoms and return to their normal lives, but for others, the road to recovery remains long and uncertain. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is essential to remember those who have been left behind. They are not forgotten, and their struggles deserve our attention and support. Research into long Covid is ongoing, and there is hope that one day, effective treatments will be found. Until then, we must ensure that those living with this condition have access to the care and resources they need.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Paris police officers suspended over beating of black music producer,"Two Paris police officers have been suspended after a video emerged appearing to show them beating a black music producer. The footage, which was widely shared on social media, shows the officers repeatedly punching and kicking Michel Zecler in his studio in the 17th arrondissement. Zecler, who is in his 40s, said he was the victim of a ""racist attack"" and that he had been ""humiliated"" by the police. The incident has sparked outrage in France, with many people calling for the officers to be prosecuted. The Paris prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the incident and the two officers have been suspended from duty. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said the footage was ""shocking"" and that he had ordered an immediate investigation. ""The images are shocking and unacceptable,"" Darmanin said. ""I have ordered an immediate investigation to shed light on the circumstances of this incident."" The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the police and the black community in France. In recent months, there have been several high-profile cases of police violence against black people, which have sparked protests and calls for reform. The French government has said it is committed to tackling police violence and has announced a number of measures to improve relations between the police and the public. However, critics say that the government has not done enough to address the issue of racial profiling and police brutality. The incident involving Zecler is likely to further fuel tensions between the police and the black community in France. It is also likely to put pressure on the government to take more action to address the issue of police violence. Zecler's lawyer, Hafida El Ali, said her client had been ""traumatized"" by the incident. ""He is in shock,"" El Ali said. ""He has been humiliated and he feels betrayed by the police."" El Ali said she hoped the investigation would lead to the officers being prosecuted. ""We want justice for Michel,"" she said.

"Isle of Man can 'beat Covid-19 again', say residents","The Isle of Man is a small island located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. It is a self-governing British Crown Dependency, with its own parliament, laws, and currency. The island has a population of around 85,000 people. In March 2020, the Isle of Man, like many other countries around the world, went into lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown measures were successful in suppressing the virus on the island, and by June 2020, the Isle of Man was one of the few places in the world to have no active cases of COVID-19. However, in September 2020, a new outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the island. The outbreak was linked to a group of people who had traveled to the island from the United Kingdom. The outbreak quickly spread, and within a few weeks, there were over 100 active cases of COVID-19 on the island. In response to the outbreak, the Isle of Man government reimposed lockdown measures. The lockdown measures were successful in slowing the spread of the virus, and by November 2020, the number of active cases had fallen to below 10. The Isle of Man is now in the process of easing its lockdown measures. The government has announced a plan to gradually reopen the island's economy and society.

Former Stonehenge A303 road proposal 'still popular locally',"Former Stonehenge A303 road proposal 'still popular locally' Despite being rejected by the government in 2020, a controversial plan to build a tunnel under Stonehenge remains popular among local residents, a new survey has found. The proposal, which would have seen the A303 trunk road diverted away from the iconic stone circle, was met with fierce opposition from heritage groups and environmentalists. However, a survey conducted by Wiltshire Council has found that 57% of local residents support the plan. The survey, which was carried out in January and February 2023, found that support for the tunnel was highest among people who live in the villages of Amesbury and Winterbourne Stoke, which are located near Stonehenge. These villages have long been affected by traffic congestion caused by the A303, which runs directly past the stone circle. Supporters of the tunnel argue that it would improve traffic flow and reduce pollution in the area. They also say that it would enhance the setting of Stonehenge, which is currently dominated by the busy road. Opponents of the tunnel, however, argue that it would damage the archaeological landscape around Stonehenge. They also say that it would be a waste of money, as there are other, less damaging ways to improve traffic flow in the area. The government rejected the tunnel proposal in 2020, saying that it would have ""irreversible and detrimental impacts"" on the World Heritage Site. However, it said that it would continue to work with stakeholders to find a solution to the traffic congestion problem. The results of the Wiltshire Council survey suggest that there is still significant local support for the tunnel proposal. However, it is unclear whether the government will be willing to reconsider its decision. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""We are aware of the results of the Wiltshire Council survey. We will continue to work with stakeholders to find a solution to the traffic congestion problem in the Stonehenge area.""

Thailand election date set and campaign ban lifted,"Thailand's Election Commission has set March 24, 2024, as the date for the next general election. The announcement came after a meeting of the commission on Friday, November 18, 2023. The election date was widely expected, as the current government's term is due to expire in March 2025. The election will be the first since the military-backed constitution was amended in 2019. The election campaign period will officially begin on February 24, 2024, with the campaign ban lifted on that day. This means that political parties will be able to hold rallies, distribute campaign materials, and engage in other campaign activities. The election will be closely watched by both domestic and international observers. It will be the first test of the new constitution, which was drafted by a military-appointed committee. The constitution has been criticized by some for giving the military too much power over the political process. There are currently 40 political parties registered with the Election Commission. The main contenders in the election are expected to be the ruling Palang Pracharath Party, the main opposition Pheu Thai Party, and the new Thai Sang Thai Party. The Palang Pracharath Party is led by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power in a military coup in 2014. The Pheu Thai Party is the largest opposition party and is associated with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

"Expert ""suspected"" Shakespeare folio theft accused","A renowned Shakespeare expert has been charged with the theft of a rare first edition of the playwright's collected works, known as the First Folio. Dr. Edward Capell, a professor at the University of Cambridge, was arrested at his home on Wednesday and is due to appear in court on Thursday. The First Folio is one of the most valuable books in the world and is estimated to be worth millions of pounds. It was published in 1623 and contains 36 plays by Shakespeare, including some that had never been printed before. The book was stolen from the library of the University of Birmingham in 2015 and has not been seen since. Dr. Capell has been a suspect in the case since shortly after the theft, but this is the first time he has been charged. The arrest of Dr. Capell has shocked the world of academia. He is a highly respected scholar who has written extensively about Shakespeare and the First Folio. He is also a former president of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. The university has released a statement saying that it is ""deeply concerned"" about the charges against Dr. Capell. The statement says that the university is ""cooperating fully with the police investigation"" and that ""the university will take appropriate action if Dr. Capell is found guilty."" The charges against Dr. Capell have also raised concerns about the security of rare books and manuscripts. The First Folio is not the only valuable book that has been stolen in recent years. In 2014, a rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible was stolen from the University of Münster in Germany. The theft of rare books and manuscripts is a serious problem and it is important to take steps to protect these valuable artifacts. Libraries and museums need to improve their security measures and law enforcement agencies need to do more to catch and prosecute those who steal these priceless items. The case of Dr. Capell is a reminder that even the most respected scholars are not immune to temptation. It is also a reminder that the theft of rare books and manuscripts is a serious crime that must be punished to the full extent of the law.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Scottish economy 'needs better balance',"Scotland's Economy Needs Better Balance Scotland's economy has long been dominated by a few key industries, such as oil and gas, financial services, and tourism. This has led to a number of challenges, including a lack of diversification and a vulnerability to fluctuations in global markets. In recent years, there have been increasing calls for the Scottish government to take action to address this imbalance. A number of reports have highlighted the need for a more diverse and resilient economy, with a greater focus on sectors such as renewable energy, manufacturing, and creative industries. The Scottish government has taken some steps to address these concerns. It has invested in a number of new industries, such as life sciences and digital technology. It has also introduced a number of measures to support businesses, including tax breaks and grants. However, more needs to be done to ensure that Scotland's economy is fit for the future. The government needs to continue to invest in new industries and support businesses. It also needs to work with the private sector to develop a long-term plan for economic development. One of the key challenges facing the Scottish government is the need to attract and retain skilled workers. Scotland has a highly educated workforce, but it is often difficult to attract workers to the country's more remote areas. The government needs to do more to promote Scotland as an attractive place to live and work. Another challenge is the need to improve productivity. Scotland's productivity has lagged behind that of other parts of the UK for a number of years. The government needs to take action to address this issue, such as investing in education and training. The Scottish economy is at a crossroads. It has the potential to be a thriving and prosperous economy, but only if the government takes action to address the challenges it faces. Recommendations The Scottish government should take the following steps to address the challenges facing the economy: Invest in new industries, such as renewable energy, manufacturing, and creative industries. Support businesses with tax breaks, grants, and other measures. Develop a long-term plan for economic development in conjunction with the private sector. Promote Scotland as an attractive place to live and work. Invest in education and training to improve productivity. By taking these steps, the Scottish government can help to create a more diverse, resilient, and prosperous economy for the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Faces of Egyptian mummies on show in Manchester,"Unveiled today at the Manchester Museum, the faces of ancient Egyptian mummies have been digitally reconstructed, revealing the identities of individuals who lived thousands of years ago. Using advanced medical imaging techniques, scientists have meticulously recreated the faces of three mummies, providing unprecedented insights into their lives and appearances. The innovative project, a collaboration between the University of Manchester and the Egyptian Mummy Project, sheds new light on the enigmatic individuals who once inhabited the enigmatic land of the pharaohs. The centerpiece of the exhibition is the meticulously reconstructed face of a woman named Meresamun. Her mummified remains were discovered in the Valley of the Kings, a testament to her status and significance in ancient Egyptian society. Meresamun's delicate features and elaborate headdress suggest she was a member of the elite, possibly even a royal. Her reconstructed face reveals a woman of remarkable beauty, with almond-shaped eyes, a slender nose, and a gentle smile. Alongside Meresamun, the exhibition showcases the reconstructed faces of two other individuals, a man named Neswaiu and a child known only as ""Manchester Mummy."" Neswaiu, a priest from the 22nd dynasty, exudes an air of authority and wisdom. His strong jawline and piercing gaze reflect his status as a respected figure within his community. In contrast, the Manchester Mummy, a child of around six years old, evokes a sense of innocence and wonder. Her plump cheeks and wide eyes capture the vulnerability of childhood, providing a poignant reminder of the fragility of life in ancient Egypt. The exhibition not only offers a glimpse into the physical appearances of these ancient individuals but also delves into their personal stories and historical context. Through the use of interactive displays and immersive technology, visitors are transported back in time, experiencing the sights and sounds of ancient Egypt. They learn about the mummification process, the beliefs and rituals surrounding death, and the social hierarchy that shaped the lives of Meresamun, Neswaiu, and the Manchester Mummy. The Faces of Egyptian Mummies exhibition at the Manchester Museum is a groundbreaking achievement in the field of Egyptology. It humanizes the ancient Egyptians, revealing their individuality and the complexities of their lives. Through the power of science and technology, we are now able to connect with these individuals on a personal level, bridging the vast gulf of time that separates us. As we gaze upon their reconstructed faces, we are reminded of the enduring legacy of human existence and the timeless fascination with the mysteries of the past.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
'Serious concerns' remain over funeral pricing,"'Serious concerns' remain over funeral pricing The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said it has ""serious concerns"" about the way funeral directors set and advertise their prices. Following a year-long investigation, the CMA has found that the market for funerals is not working well for consumers. Most funeral directors fail to provide itemised pricing or accurate cost comparisons, making it difficult for bereaved families to compare prices and find the best deal. The CMA also found that some funeral directors used misleading or aggressive sales tactics, and that many consumers felt pressured into buying more expensive services than they wanted. The CMA has made a number of recommendations to improve the market, including: Funeral directors should be required to provide clear and accurate itemised pricing, including a breakdown of all costs. Funeral directors should be banned from using misleading or aggressive sales tactics. The government should consider introducing a price cap on funeral costs. The CMA's investigation found that the average cost of a funeral in the UK is now around £4,000. However, the cost can vary significantly depending on the type of funeral and the services chosen. The CMA's chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""Our investigation has found that the market for funerals is not working well for consumers. ""We have serious concerns about the way funeral directors set and advertise their prices, and we are concerned that some consumers are being taken advantage of at a time when they are most vulnerable."" The CMA's findings have been welcomed by consumer groups. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ""The CMA's report exposes the scandalous rip-off in the funeral market. ""For too long, funeral directors have taken advantage of grieving families by charging sky-high prices and using misleading sales tactics. ""The CMA's recommendations are a step in the right direction, but the government must now take action to ensure that these changes are implemented."" The Funeral Directors Association (FDA) said it was ""disappointed"" with the CMA's findings. The FDA said that its members were ""committed to providing a high standard of service to bereaved families"" and that they ""comply with all relevant laws and regulations"". The FDA said it would ""carefully consider"" the CMA's recommendations and ""work with the government to ensure that any changes to the market are in the best interests of consumers"".",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Charles Bronson cleared of trying to attack prison governor,"Charles Bronson has been cleared of attempting to attack a prison governor. The jury at Leeds Crown Court found Bronson not guilty of plotting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to Mark Humphreys, the governor of HMP Wakefield. Bronson, 68, who has spent much of his adult life in prison, had denied the charge. The trial heard that Bronson had sent a series of letters to Humphreys in which he made threats of violence. In one letter, Bronson wrote: ""I'm going to rip your f head off and s* down your neck."" He also said he would ""smash your f head in with a snooker ball in a sock"". However, the jury accepted Bronson's defense that he was simply trying to intimidate Humphreys and had no intention of carrying out the threats. The jury also heard that Bronson has a long history of self-harm and has often made threats of violence to prison staff. In his closing speech, Bronson's barrister, Richard Wright QC, said: ""He is a man who has spent his life in prison and has had a troubled relationship with the prison service. ""He has made threats in the past, but he has never carried them out. ""He is a fantasist and a self-harmer. He makes these threats as a way of getting attention and as a way of lashing out at the system."" The jury deliberated for two days before returning a verdict of not guilty. Bronson, who has been in prison for more than 40 years, is one of Britain's most notorious prisoners. He has been convicted of a string of violent offenses, including robbery, assault, and kidnapping. In 1999, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for taking a prison officer hostage. Bronson has been the subject of several books and documentaries. In 2008, a film about his life, Bronson, was released starring Tom Hardy.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

New Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis' big decisions,"Huw Lewis, the newly appointed Welsh Education Minister, has outlined his ambitious plans to transform the education system in Wales. Lewis, who took office in May 2021, has already made a number of significant decisions that are set to have a major impact on schools, colleges, and universities across the country. One of Lewis's most controversial decisions is to scrap the national curriculum for primary schools. He argues that the current curriculum is too prescriptive and stifles creativity. Instead, he wants schools to have more freedom to develop their own curriculums that are tailored to the needs of their pupils. Lewis has also announced plans to introduce a new system of vocational qualifications. He believes that the current system is too academic and does not provide young people with the skills they need to succeed in the modern workplace. The new system will offer a wider range of vocational qualifications, including apprenticeships and foundation degrees. In addition, Lewis has pledged to increase funding for early years education. He believes that investing in early years education is essential for improving children's life chances. He has also announced plans to introduce a new childcare subsidy for low-income families.

Smart motorways to be reviewed over driver safety fears,"Smart motorways are to be reviewed over concerns about driver safety, the government has announced. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had asked National Highways to carry out a stocktake of all smart motorways without a hard shoulder. It comes after a number of fatal accidents on smart motorways, including one in which a woman was killed when her car was hit from behind by a lorry. The review will look at the safety of smart motorways and consider whether any changes need to be made. Smart motorways use technology to manage traffic flow, such as variable speed limits and overhead gantries. They have been introduced on a number of major roads in England in recent years. However, there have been concerns about their safety, particularly in relation to the lack of a hard shoulder. In the event of a breakdown or accident, drivers are advised to pull over into an emergency refuge area. However, these areas are often spaced several miles apart. Critics argue that this can leave drivers stranded in dangerous situations, particularly at night or in bad weather. The government has previously defended smart motorways, saying that they are safer than traditional motorways. However, the recent spate of fatal accidents has led to renewed calls for a review of their safety. The RAC welcomed the announcement of the review, saying it was ""long overdue"". ""We've been calling for a full and independent review of smart motorways for some time now,"" said RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes. ""The government has finally listened to our concerns and we hope that this review will lead to some much-needed changes."" The AA also welcomed the review, but said it should be ""wide-ranging and independent"". ""We need to look at all aspects of smart motorways, including the design, the technology and the way they are operated,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""We also need to look at the impact of smart motorways on drivers, particularly those who are vulnerable."" The Transport Secretary said he wanted the review to be completed as soon as possible. ""I want to be absolutely sure that our roads are as safe as they can be,"" he said. ""That's why I've asked National Highways to carry out this stocktake of all smart motorways without a hard shoulder."" The review is expected to report back to the government in the autumn.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip,"Toymakers and retailers are placing their bets on a bumper Christmas to offset a year of falling sales. Figures from the NPD Group show that sales of toys in the UK fell by 3% in the first half of 2023, with the value of the market dropping by £50 million to £803 million. The decline follows a boom in toy sales during the pandemic, when children were stuck at home and parents were looking for ways to keep them entertained. But with the cost of living crisis putting pressure on household budgets, families are now cutting back on non-essential spending - and toys are often one of the first things to go. Despite the challenging market conditions, toymakers and retailers are hoping that Christmas will provide a much-needed boost. NPD's UK toy market analyst Frederique Tutt said: ""The Christmas period is crucial for the toy industry, accounting for around 60% of annual sales. ""We expect to see a return to more traditional festive spending patterns this year, with families looking to make the most of the occasion after two years of disrupted celebrations."" Toymakers have been working hard to develop new and innovative products that will appeal to children this Christmas. One of the biggest trends this year is the rise of STEM toys - products that combine science, technology, engineering and maths. These toys are designed to be educational as well as fun, and they can help children to develop important skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking and creativity. Another big trend this year is the resurgence of classic toys. Products such as board games, dolls and action figures are all seeing a resurgence in popularity, as parents and grandparents look for ways to connect with their children and grandchildren through shared experiences. Retailers are also getting ready for the Christmas rush. Many are offering discounts and promotions to attract shoppers, and they are also increasing their stocks of popular toys to ensure that they have plenty to meet demand. The British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) is confident that the toy industry will have a successful Christmas. BTHA chief executive Roland Earl said: ""We know that families are facing financial pressures at the moment, but we believe that toys will still be a priority for many people this Christmas. ""Toys provide children with essential play and learning experiences, and they can also help to create special memories that will last a lifetime.""",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Greggs to open shops despite first loss in 36 years,"Greggs to Open Shops Despite First Loss in 36 Years Despite suffering its first annual loss in 36 years, Greggs has announced plans to open new shops and roll out a delivery service. The bakery chain reported a pre-tax loss of £14.7 million for 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close stores and reduce operating hours. However, Greggs said it is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the future and plans to invest in its business. As part of its expansion plans, Greggs will open 100 new shops in the UK this year, creating around 500 jobs. The company will also trial a delivery service in partnership with Just Eat. Greggs CEO Roger Whiteside said: ""We have emerged from a challenging year in a strong position. Our business model has proven to be resilient, and we have a loyal customer base. We are now well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead."" The company's decision to open new shops and invest in delivery comes as other retailers have been forced to close stores due to the pandemic. However, Greggs believes that its value-for-money offerings and convenient locations will continue to attract customers. Greggs has been a fixture on British high streets for over 80 years. The company is known for its affordable pasties, sausage rolls, and other baked goods. In recent years, Greggs has also expanded its menu to include healthier options, such as salads and sandwiches. The company's first loss in 36 years is a sign of the challenges that the retail sector has faced during the pandemic. However, Greggs' plans to open new shops and invest in delivery suggest that it is confident about the future. Analysis Greggs' decision to open new shops and invest in delivery despite its first loss in 36 years is a bold move. However, the company has a strong track record of success and is well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. The company's value-for-money offerings and convenient locations are likely to continue to attract customers, even as other retailers struggle. Greggs is also well-placed to benefit from the growing trend towards online shopping. If Greggs can successfully execute its expansion plans, it is likely to emerge from the pandemic even stronger than before.

Four Irish language groups lose key funding,"Four Irish Language Groups Lose Key Funding Four Irish language groups have lost out on key funding that has supported their work for decades. The groups, which include Conradh na Gaeilge, Glór na nGael and Foras na Gaeilge, have been told that their funding from the Department of Rural and Community Development will not be renewed. The decision has been met with dismay by the groups, who say it will have a devastating impact on their work promoting and preserving the Irish language. Conradh na Gaeilge President Aodán Mac Póilin said the loss of funding would be ""a hammer blow"" to the group. ""We have been working for over a century to promote the Irish language, and this funding has been essential to our work,"" he said. ""This decision is a betrayal of the Irish language and of the people who have worked so hard to keep it alive."" Glór na nGael Director Seán Ó Coinn said the loss of funding would mean the closure of the group's Irish language radio station, Raidió na Gaeltachta. ""This is a vital service for the Irish-speaking community in Ireland and abroad,"" he said. ""It provides a platform for Irish language news, music and culture, and it is a lifeline for many people who live in isolated areas."" Foras na Gaeilge Chief Executive Seán Ó Cuirreáin said the loss of funding would have a ""crippling"" impact on the group's work to promote the Irish language in education and the media. ""We have been working with schools, universities and media outlets to increase the use of Irish,"" he said. ""This funding has been essential to our work, and its loss will set us back years."" The groups have appealed to the Department of Rural and Community Development to reconsider its decision. They have also launched a campaign to raise public awareness of the issue. The Department of Rural and Community Development said the decision to cut funding was made as part of a wider review of its budget.

The decision has been criticised by politicians from all parties. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the loss of funding was ""a disgrace"".

Yahya Rashid, 25, of no fixed address, was released on bail in October 2022 after being charged with a number of terror-related offences, including preparing for acts of terrorism and possessing a firearm without a certificate. He was due to appear at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, but failed to attend. Rashid is a British citizen who was born in Sudan. He has been subject to a Tpim since 2015, which restricts his movements and activities. Under the Tpim, Rashid is required to live at a specified address, observe a curfew, and report regularly to the police. He is also banned from contacting certain people and using the internet. The Tpim is a preventative measure that can be imposed on individuals who are suspected of being involved in terrorism, but who have not been charged with an offence. It is designed to disrupt and restrict their activities, and to protect the public from harm. The Metropolitan Police has said that Rashid is not considered to be a direct threat to the public at this time. However, officers are urging anyone who sees him to call 999 and not to approach him.

Third Menai crossing construction 'could start by 2021',"Work on a third Menai crossing could start by 2021, the Welsh Government has said. The project to build a new bridge or tunnel linking Anglesey to mainland Wales has been discussed for decades. The Welsh Government said a public consultation would begin in the autumn. It said construction could begin on the preferred option by 2021, subject to all necessary approvals. The Menai Suspension Bridge was built in 1826 and the Britannia Bridge was built in 1850. Traffic congestion on both bridges is a regular problem, particularly during the summer months. The Welsh Government said its preferred option is a new bridge next to the existing Britannia Bridge. It said this would be the most cost-effective option and would cause the least disruption to the environment and local communities. The other options are a tunnel or a new bridge next to the Menai Suspension Bridge. The public consultation will run from October 1 to November 29. The Welsh Government said it would also be carrying out technical studies and environmental assessments. It said a preferred route would be announced next summer. The project is expected to cost between £1bn and £1.5bn. The Welsh Government said it was committed to funding the project but would also seek financial support from the UK Government. The UK Government has said it is ""fully supportive"" of the project and is ""working closely"" with the Welsh Government. The Menai crossing is a key part of the Welsh Government's infrastructure plans. It says it will improve connectivity between north and south Wales and boost the economy of the region. The project has been welcomed by business leaders and politicians in north Wales. However, some environmental groups have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the Menai Strait.

Iran sanctions: US moves to isolate 'major' banks,"US moves to isolate 'major' Iranian banks The United States has taken steps to isolate two Iranian banks, accusing them of funding terrorism. The Trump administration has revoked the licenses of Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, which allow them to operate in the US. The Treasury Department said the banks were ""major"" financial institutions that had ""knowingly facilitated"" transactions for terrorist organisations. The move is the latest in a series of sanctions imposed by the US on Iran since President Trump took office. The sanctions have been aimed at pressuring Iran to change its behaviour, including its nuclear programme and its support for terrorism. The Iranian government has condemned the sanctions as ""economic terrorism"" and has accused the US of trying to destabilise the country. The US Treasury Department said that Bank Melli and Bank Saderat had ""knowingly facilitated"" transactions for terrorist organisations, including Hezbollah and Hamas. The department said that the banks had provided financial services to the organisations and had ""moved money on their behalf."" The Treasury Department also said that the banks had ""failed to conduct adequate due diligence"" on their customers and had ""turned a blind eye"" to their terrorist activities. The US has also sanctioned several other Iranian banks in recent months, including Bank Sepah and Bank Ansar. The sanctions have had a significant impact on the Iranian economy, making it difficult for businesses to trade with the country. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the Iranian economy will contract by 6% this year and that inflation will rise to 37%. The US has also imposed sanctions on Iran's oil industry, which is a major source of revenue for the government. The sanctions have made it difficult for Iran to sell its oil and have led to a sharp decline in its oil exports. The US has said that it is willing to lift the sanctions if Iran changes its behaviour. However, the Iranian government has said that it will not negotiate with the US while the sanctions are in place. The US sanctions have been controversial. Some critics have argued that the sanctions are ineffective and that they are causing unnecessary hardship to the Iranian people.

They are also more likely to have underlying health conditions that can make them more vulnerable to the virus. Despite this, there is evidence that people from BAME backgrounds are less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. A recent survey found that only 57% of Black people and 62% of Asian people in the UK said they would definitely or probably get the vaccine, compared to 79% of white people. There are a number of reasons why people from BAME backgrounds may be hesitant to accept the vaccine. Some people may have concerns about the safety of the vaccine, while others may not trust the government or healthcare system.

Edward Snowden 'smeared by UK officials',"Edward Snowden Smeared by UK Officials Secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden have revealed that senior UK officials attempted to discredit him by smearing his character and spreading false information about his motives. According to the files, British intelligence agencies worked with media outlets to portray Snowden as a ""traitor,"" ""egoist,"" and ""attention seeker."" They also claimed that he was motivated by a desire for personal revenge against the government. These allegations have been strongly denied by Snowden, who maintains that he leaked the documents in order to expose the government's mass surveillance program, which he believed was a threat to civil liberties. The documents, which were obtained by the Intercept website, also show that British officials were aware of the US government's plans to prosecute Snowden and extradite him to the US. However, they did not offer him asylum or take any steps to protect him from prosecution. This has led to accusations that the UK government was complicit in the US government's attempts to silence Snowden. The revelations have been met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and journalists. They have called on the UK government to apologize to Snowden and to drop any charges against him. Snowden, who is currently living in exile in Russia, said that the documents ""vindicate everything I have said about the global surveillance system."" He added that he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the actions of the UK government. The allegations against British officials come at a time of heightened scrutiny of government surveillance programs. In recent years, several whistleblowers have come forward to expose the extent to which governments around the world are collecting data on their citizens. The Snowden leaks have been particularly damaging to the UK government, which has been accused of being too close to the US and of failing to protect the privacy of its citizens. The revelations are likely to further damage the already strained relationship between the UK and Russia. The two countries have been at odds over a number of issues, including the annexation of Crimea and the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. The Snowden leaks have also raised questions about the future of whistleblowing. In an era of mass surveillance, it is becoming increasingly difficult for whistleblowers to expose government wrongdoing without risking prosecution or persecution.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Firefighters in Scotland reject pay deal for second time,"Firefighters in Scotland Reject Pay Deal for Second Time In a resounding rejection, firefighters in Scotland have voted against a proposed pay deal for the second time, escalating tensions between the Scottish Fire Brigades Union (SFBU) and the Scottish government. The union, which represents over 3,500 firefighters and control staff, held a second ballot on the pay offer. According to the results released on Thursday, 87% of members voted against the deal. The rejected offer included a 5% pay increase over two years, but fell short of the union's demand for a 10% rise to match inflation. The SFBU has argued that firefighters have lost significant purchasing power in recent years due to rising living costs. Martin Blunden, the SFBU's executive director, said the result of the ballot was ""a clear and unequivocal mandate"" from members. ""The government has failed to take into account the real-terms pay cut firefighters have suffered over the years,"" Blunden said. ""This offer was simply not good enough."" The Scottish government has expressed disappointment at the outcome of the ballot but has remained committed to finding a resolution. ""We believe the pay offer was fair and reasonable and above the average pay increase in the public sector,"" said Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary for social justice, housing and local government. ""We will continue to engage with the Scottish Fire Brigades Union and other stakeholders to find a way forward,"" Robison added. The rejection of the pay deal has raised concerns about the potential for industrial action. The SFBU has not ruled out the possibility of a strike if the government does not meet its demands. ""Our members are determined to secure a fair and just pay deal,"" Blunden said. ""We will consider all options available to us, including industrial action."" The Scottish government has urged the union to reconsider its position and has reiterated its commitment to ongoing negotiations. The last time firefighters in Scotland took industrial action was in 2015, when they staged a 48-hour strike over pay and conditions. The strike caused widespread disruption across the country and highlighted the importance of the fire service. The current pay dispute is expected to continue for some time, with both sides expressing a desire to reach a compromise. However, the outcome of the second ballot has put pressure on the government to improve its offer.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Lockdown party crash: South Wales PC Tasia Stephens' gross misconduct,"A police officer has been found guilty of gross misconduct after organising an illegal lockdown party. PC Tasia Stephens, 45, of South Wales Police, held a gathering of more than 30 people at her home in Llanharan on December 12, 2020. The party was reported to police and officers attended and broke it up. Stephens was subsequently charged with organising the event and pleaded guilty to the offence at Cardiff Magistrates' Court in November. A disciplinary hearing was held on Monday and Stephens was found guilty of gross misconduct. The hearing was told that Stephens had invited guests to the party via a WhatsApp group and had told them to bring their own food and drink. She had also arranged for a DJ to play music and had hired a bouncy castle for the children attending. The hearing was told that Stephens had ignored the government's lockdown rules and had put her colleagues and the public at risk. In a statement, South Wales Police said: ""We expect the highest standards of behaviour from our officers and staff and will not tolerate any breaches of the law or our own policies. ""PC Stephens' actions fell well below the standards expected of a police officer and she has rightly been found guilty of gross misconduct."" Stephens has been dismissed from South Wales Police with immediate effect. The force said: ""We hope her dismissal sends a clear message that we will not tolerate any breaches of the law or our own policies."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had investigated the matter and had found that Stephens had breached the standards of professional behaviour. The IOPC said: ""We welcome the decision of the force to dismiss PC Stephens. Her actions were a clear breach of the standards of professional behaviour and she has rightly been held to account."" The IOPC said it had also referred the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which had decided not to bring any charges against Stephens. The CPS said: ""We have carefully considered the evidence in this case and have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to bring any charges against PC Stephens."" The CPS said it had taken into account the fact that Stephens had pleaded guilty to the offence of organising an illegal gathering and had been dismissed from the police force.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Liam Fox still in running for WTO chief as race narrows,"Liam Fox still in running for WTO chief as race narrows Liam Fox is still in the running to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite a process that has been dogged by delays and allegations of a lack of transparency. The former UK trade secretary is one of just two candidates left in the race, after Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala withdrew her candidacy on Wednesday. The other remaining candidate is South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee. The WTO has been without a permanent director-general since Roberto Azevêdo stepped down in August 2020. The selection process has been beset by delays and allegations of a lack of transparency. In October, the WTO's selection committee was forced to restart the process after the United States blocked the appointment of Okonjo-Iweala. The US has since said that it will support Yoo, but it is not clear whether she has the support of the other WTO members. Fox has said that he is ""confident"" that he can win the race. He has promised to ""reform the WTO and make it fit for the 21st century"". He has also said that he will ""work to ensure that the WTO plays a central role in the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic"". However, Fox's candidacy has been met with some criticism. Some have questioned whether he has the necessary experience to lead the WTO. Others have pointed to his close ties to the UK government, which has been accused of protectionism. Despite these criticisms, Fox remains a contender for the role. The WTO is expected to announce the new director-general in March. The successful candidate will face a number of challenges, including the need to reform the WTO and to address the challenges of the global trading system. Fox has said that he is ""up for the challenge"" and that he is ""determined to make the WTO a more effective and efficient organization"".",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
What to expect from record year of privatisations,"What to expect from record year of privatisations The UK government is set to privatise more public assets than ever before as it seeks to raise funds and reduce the national debt. In the coming year, a number of high-profile companies are expected to be sold off, including Royal Mail, Channel 4, and Ordnance Survey. The government argues that privatisation will make these companies more efficient and competitive, and will allow them to invest more in their services. However, critics argue that privatisation will lead to higher prices, lower quality services, and job losses. Here is what to expect from the record year of privatisations: Higher prices: Privatisation often leads to higher prices for consumers, as companies are no longer subject to the same level of regulation. This is because private companies are profit-driven, and they will always seek to maximise their profits. Lower quality services: Privatisation can also lead to lower quality services, as companies are no longer obliged to provide the same level of service as they were when they were in the public sector. This is because private companies are not subject to the same level of accountability as public sector companies. Job losses: Privatisation can also lead to job losses, as companies often seek to reduce costs by cutting staff. This is because private companies are not subject to the same level of employment protection as public sector companies. The government has said that it will take steps to protect consumers and workers from the negative effects of privatisation. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks before these companies are sold off. Here are some of the key companies that are expected to be privatised in the coming year: Royal Mail: Royal Mail is the UK's postal service. It is currently owned by the government, but it is expected to be sold off in the coming year. The government has said that it will retain a ""golden share"" in Royal Mail, which will give it the power to veto any decisions that could damage the company. Channel 4: Channel 4 is a public service broadcaster. It is currently owned by the government, but it is expected to be sold off in the coming year. The government has said that it will retain a ""special share"" in Channel 4, which will give it the power to veto any decisions that could damage the company's public service remit. Ordnance Survey: Ordnance Survey is the UK's national mapping agency. It is currently owned by the government, but it is expected to be sold off in the coming year. The government has said that it will retain a ""golden share"" in Ordnance Survey, which will give it the power to veto any decisions that could damage the company. The government's privatisation programme is likely to be controversial. However, it is important to remember that privatisation is not always a bad thing. In some cases, it can lead to increased efficiency, competition, and investment. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks before these companies are sold off.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Skomer Island: Funding fears for 40-year bird research,"Skomer Island, a haven for wildlife off the coast of Pembrokeshire, is facing an uncertain future for its long-term bird monitoring program due to funding concerns. For four decades, researchers have meticulously collected data on the island's breeding seabirds, providing invaluable insights into their population trends and the impact of environmental changes. This vital research has highlighted the island's significance as a nesting site for Atlantic puffins, European storm petrels, and Manx shearwaters. The data has also revealed worrying declines in some species, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and conservation efforts. Skomer Island is owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, which has traditionally funded the bird monitoring program. However, the trust is now facing financial pressures, leaving the future of the research in jeopardy. ""We're incredibly concerned about the potential loss of this long-term dataset,"" said Dr. Jennifer Gill, a researcher involved in the monitoring program. ""The data we've collected over the past 40 years is not just a record of bird numbers; it's a priceless resource that helps us understand the health of our marine ecosystems and the impact of human activities."" The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales is actively seeking funding to secure the continuation of the bird monitoring program. They are calling on individuals, organizations, and government agencies to support their efforts. ""Skomer Island is a national treasure,"" said Dr. Gill. ""Its seabird populations are a vital part of our natural heritage, and we have a responsibility to ensure their long-term survival. By supporting the bird monitoring program, we can continue to track their progress and make informed decisions about how to protect them."" The funding crisis facing Skomer Island's bird research highlights the importance of long-term monitoring programs in conservation. These programs provide scientists with critical data that can inform decision-making and guide conservation strategies. Without continued funding, valuable scientific knowledge and the ability to track the health of our natural ecosystems will be lost.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Environment Agency abandons sell-off of dredging equipment,"The Environment Agency has abandoned plans to sell off its dredging equipment, following a backlash from environmental groups and politicians. The agency had been planning to sell off its fleet of dredgers, which are used to clear silt and debris from rivers and canals. However, campaigners argued that the sale would lead to a decline in the quality of England's waterways. The Environment Agency has now confirmed that it will retain its dredging equipment and continue to use it to maintain the country's waterways. The decision is a victory for environmental groups, who have been campaigning against the sell-off for months. The groups argued that the sale would have a negative impact on wildlife, as well as increasing the risk of flooding. The decision is also a blow to the government, which had been hoping to raise money from the sale of the dredging equipment. The government has been under pressure to reduce its spending, and the sale of the equipment would have helped to raise funds. However, the government has now accepted that the environmental benefits of retaining the dredging equipment outweigh the financial benefits of selling it. The Environment Agency has said that it will continue to invest in its dredging equipment and ensure that England's waterways are kept clean and safe. The decision to abandon the sell-off has been welcomed by environmental groups. The Wildlife Trusts said that the decision was ""a victory for common sense"" and that it would ""protect our rivers and canals for future generations.""

HMP Birmingham: Funding dispute stopped CCTV installation,"HMP Birmingham: Funding dispute stopped CCTV installation The installation of new CCTV cameras at HMP Birmingham has been halted due to a dispute over funding. The Prison Service had planned to install the cameras as part of a £10 million security upgrade at the jail. However, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has refused to provide the necessary funding. The Prison Service says the cameras are essential to improve security at the jail, which has been plagued by violence and disorder in recent years. However, the MoJ says it does not have the money to fund the project. The dispute has left the Prison Service in a difficult position. It is keen to improve security at the jail, but it cannot do so without the necessary funding. The MoJ has said it is committed to improving security at HMP Birmingham, but it has not provided any details of how it plans to do this. The dispute is the latest in a series of funding cuts that have hit the Prison Service in recent years. The service has lost 40% of its budget since 2010, and it is now struggling to cope with the rising number of prisoners. The cuts have had a significant impact on security at prisons. In 2016, there were more than 20,000 assaults on staff in prisons in England and Wales. The Prison Service has warned that the cuts are making it increasingly difficult to keep prisons safe. The service is now calling on the government to provide more funding to improve security at prisons.

Pope Francis shuns grand apartment for two rooms,"In a break from tradition, Pope Francis has chosen to forgo the grandeur of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace and instead reside in a modest two-room suite in the Vatican guesthouse. This decision reflects the Pope's commitment to living a simple and humble life, in line with his teachings on the importance of poverty and service to others. The papal apartments, located on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, have been the residence of popes for centuries, offering spacious and opulent accommodations. Pope Benedict XVI, who preceded Pope Francis, chose to live in the smaller quarters of the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery within the Vatican grounds. However, Pope Francis has opted for an even more modest living arrangement. The two rooms that Pope Francis now calls home are located in the Domus Sanctae Marthae, a Vatican guesthouse that houses cardinals, bishops, and other visitors. The suite includes a bedroom, a small sitting room, and a bathroom. The furnishings are simple and functional, with a bed, a desk, and a few chairs. Pope Francis's decision to live in the Vatican guesthouse signals his desire to live among the people he serves. By choosing to forgo the trappings of luxury, the Pope is sending a clear message that he is not above his flock and that he is committed to living a life of simplicity and humility. This move is consistent with Pope Francis's broader message of inclusivity and service. Since being elected in 2013, the Pope has repeatedly called for a more compassionate and welcoming Church that prioritizes the needs of the poor and marginalized. He has also emphasized the importance of dialogue and understanding among people of all faiths and cultures. Pope Francis's decision to live in a modest suite has been met with praise from many quarters, who see it as a sign of his commitment to living his faith and serving others.

Bluebird's electric car record hit by beach 'pothole',"Bluebird's electric car record attempt ends abruptly after hitting a pothole on Pendine Sands Pendine Sands, UK - A world record attempt by an electric car has been cut short after the vehicle hit a pothole on the beach. The Bluebird electric car, driven by Alex Fowkes, was attempting to break the world record for the fastest electric car over a measured mile. However, the car hit a pothole at high speed, causing significant damage to the vehicle. Fowkes was uninjured in the incident, but the car was unable to continue the record attempt. The Bluebird team said they were ""extremely disappointed"" to have to abandon the record attempt. ""We had put in a lot of hard work and preparation, and we were confident that we had a car capable of breaking the record,"" said team manager Mark Jenkins. ""Unfortunately, we hit a pothole at high speed, and it caused significant damage to the car. ""We're all very disappointed, but we're proud of the car and the team. We'll be back next year to try again."" The Bluebird electric car is a custom-built vehicle designed to break the world record for the fastest electric car over a measured mile. The car is powered by four electric motors, and it has a top speed of over 200 mph. The record attempt was taking place on Pendine Sands in Wales, which is a famous location for land speed record attempts. In 1924, Malcolm Campbell set the world land speed record on Pendine Sands in his car, Bluebird.

Strule campus will not open 'until at least 2025',"Strule campus will not open 'until at least 2025' after fresh delays A new further education campus in Omagh will not open until at least 2025 after suffering further delays. The Strule campus was originally due to open in September 2023 but this was pushed back to September 2024. However, the Department of Education has now confirmed that the opening will be delayed again, with a new target date of September 2025. The department said the delay was due to a number of factors, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for additional design work. The Strule campus is a joint venture between South West College and the Western Education and Library Board (WELB). It will be located on the site of the former Omagh Boys' High School and will accommodate up to 2,000 students. The campus will offer a range of further and higher education courses, including apprenticeships, vocational courses and university-level qualifications. It is hoped that the campus will help to boost the local economy and provide much-needed skills for the workforce. However, the delays have been met with disappointment by some. The Ulster Unionist Party MLA Tom Elliott said the delay was ""unacceptable"". ""This is a vital project for Omagh and the surrounding area,"" he said.

"Donald Trump 'unaware UK was nuclear power', says former aide","Former aide to Donald Trump, John Bolton, has claimed in his new book that the US president was unaware the UK was a nuclear power. The allegation has been met with incredulity by many, including former British Prime Minister, John Major, who said it was ""beyond belief"". Bolton's book, ""The Room Where It Happened"", is a tell-all account of his time working in the White House. In it, he claims that during a meeting with Theresa May in 2018, Trump asked if the UK had ""its own nuclear capability"". According to Bolton, May was ""taken aback"" by the question and replied that the UK had been a nuclear power since the 1950s. Trump is then said to have replied: ""Oh, are you? I didn't know that."" Bolton's claim has been widely ridiculed, with many pointing out that the UK's nuclear status is well known and has been for many years. Former British Prime Minister, John Major, said that the idea that Trump was unaware of this was ""beyond belief"". ""It's a matter of public record that the UK has been a nuclear power since 1952,"" Major said. ""It's simply not credible to suggest that the US President would not know this."" Other experts have also cast doubt on Bolton's claim. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former British Foreign Secretary, said it was ""impossible"" that Trump would not have known about the UK's nuclear status. ""He would have been briefed on this repeatedly,"" Rifkind said. ""It's part of the basic knowledge that any US President has to have."" Bolton's book has been met with mixed reviews. Some have praised it as a valuable insight into the inner workings of the Trump administration, while others have criticized it as a self-serving attack on the president. The claim that Trump was unaware of the UK's nuclear status is likely to be one of the most controversial aspects of the book.

"Long Covid: More than a million affected in February, survey suggests","More than a million people in the UK were experiencing symptoms of long Covid in February, according to a major survey. The study, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), found that 1.3 million people aged two and over in private households in the UK self-reported experiencing long Covid symptoms four weeks after the onset of their first Covid-19 infection. Of these, 821,000 people reported that their ability to carry out day-to-day activities was limited because of long Covid. The survey, which was carried out between 1 and 20 February, found that the prevalence of long Covid was highest in the 35 to 49 age group, with an estimated 3.8% of people in this age group experiencing symptoms. Women were more likely to report symptoms of long Covid than men, with 2.1% of women and 1.5% of men reporting symptoms. The most common symptoms of long Covid reported in the survey were fatigue (63%), headache (52%), and shortness of breath (40%). Other common symptoms included muscle ache (34%), sore throat (29%), and changes to sense of smell (28%). The survey also found that the prevalence of long Covid was higher in people who had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, with 27% of people who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 reporting symptoms of long Covid. The ONS said that the survey suggests that the number of people experiencing long Covid symptoms in the UK is ""substantial"". The organization said that the findings of the survey are ""consistent with other studies that have estimated the prevalence of long Covid in the UK and other countries"". The ONS said that further research is needed to understand the long-term impacts of long Covid and to develop effective treatments. The findings of the survey come as the UK government is considering introducing a new scheme to provide support to people with long Covid. The scheme, which is being developed by the Department of Health and Social Care, is expected to provide access to a range of services, including specialist medical care, rehabilitation and financial support.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Dutch police give 'stop paedophile hunts' warning after Arnhem death,"Dutch police have given a stark warning to people who target suspected paedophiles after a man was beaten to death in the eastern city of Arnhem. The 57-year-old man, named locally as Aart Alberda, died in hospital on Friday after being attacked in a park the previous day. Police arrested a 23-year-old man from Arnhem, who they say confessed to carrying out the assault. The force said it is investigating links to far-right groups and ""groups of citizens who are taking justice into their own hands"". Chief Constable Martin Sitalsing said: ""This case should send a shock through us all. This man was killed in a brutal way based on a rumour. It is a terrible thing to have happened."" He added: ""We are urging people to stop taking the law into their own hands. If you have information about someone who is suspected of committing a crime, please contact the police."" The killing comes amid growing concern in the Netherlands about vigilantism targeting those suspected of being paedophiles. In recent months, there have been several instances of suspected paedophiles being doxed - having their personal details published online - and threatened with violence. Last month, a man was arrested in the central city of Utrecht after he allegedly threatened to kill a woman who he believed was a paedophile. The woman, who is in her 60s, had her name and address published online after being falsely accused of sexually abusing a child. Chief Constable Sitalsing said the police are taking the issue of vigilantism very seriously. He said: ""We will not tolerate people taking the law into their own hands. It is illegal and it is dangerous. We will do everything we can to find and prosecute those responsible for these crimes."" The Dutch government has also condemned the attacks on suspected paedophiles. Justice Minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus said: ""These are cowardly attacks on innocent people. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our society."" He added: ""We are working closely with the police to identify and prosecute those responsible. We will also be introducing new measures to protect people at risk of vigilante attacks."" The killing of Aart Alberda has shocked the Netherlands and has led to calls for tougher action to be taken against vigilantism.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

He also played a key role in the development of the Hawker Hurricane, one of the most iconic fighter planes of the war. After the war, Unwin continued to fly and became a respected aviation historian. He wrote several books and articles about his experiences, and he was a frequent lecturer at air shows and museums. Unwin died in 1984 at the age of 82. He was a true pioneer of aviation, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of pilots and aviation enthusiasts.

Three charged over Tesco accounts fraud,"Three men have been charged with fraud offences after an alleged £2m scam targeting Tesco accounts. The men, aged 24, 25 and 26, were arrested in the West Midlands and London on Tuesday. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and are due to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday. The charges relate to an alleged scam where fraudsters used fake and stolen identities to create Tesco Clubcard accounts. They are then said to have used the accounts to buy high-value items, such as televisions and laptops, which were then sold on for a profit. Tesco said it was aware of the alleged fraud and was working with the police. A spokesperson for the supermarket chain said: ""We take fraud very seriously and we work closely with the police to investigate any suspicious activity. ""We have a number of measures in place to protect our customers from fraud, including robust identity checks and fraud monitoring systems.

East Midlands Ambulance Service misses care targets,"East Midlands Ambulance Service Misses Care Targets The East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) has once again missed its key response time targets, with only 67.1% of the most serious calls being reached within eight minutes in December. This falls well short of the national target of 75%. The figures, published by NHS England, also show that EMAS missed its target for responding to category A calls within 19 minutes, with only 83.5% of these calls being met within the target time. This is down from 87.1% in November. Category A calls are the most life-threatening, such as cardiac arrest and major trauma. The target is to respond to these calls within eight minutes, although this can be extended to 19 minutes in some circumstances. The figures for December show that EMAS is facing significant challenges in meeting its response time targets. The service has been under increasing pressure in recent months due to a combination of factors, including rising demand, staff shortages, and delays in handover at hospitals. EMAS has acknowledged the need to improve its performance and has set out a number of measures to do so. These include recruiting more staff, investing in new vehicles and equipment, and working with hospitals to reduce handover delays. However, the service has warned that it will take time to see the benefits of these measures. In the meantime, EMAS is urging the public to use the ambulance service responsibly and to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies. The latest figures have prompted a mixed reaction from local politicians and health leaders. Some have expressed concern about the service's ability to meet the needs of the public, while others have welcomed the steps that EMAS is taking to improve its performance.

"Trains, buses, ferries and trams face service cuts","Trains, Buses, Ferries and Trams Face Service Cuts Public transport services across the country are facing severe cuts as a result of the ongoing funding crisis. Trains, buses, ferries and trams are all affected, with some facing reductions in frequency, capacity and routes. Train operators have warned that the cuts will lead to longer journey times, overcrowding and a deterioration in the quality of service. Passengers will also have to pay more for their tickets, as fares are set to increase to offset the funding shortfall. Bus services are also being hit hard, with some operators cutting routes and reducing the frequency of services. This will have a particularly significant impact on rural communities, where public transport is often the only way to get around. Ferries are also facing cuts, with some services being axed altogether. This will make it more difficult for people to travel to and from islands and coastal towns. Tram services are also being affected, with some lines being closed and others seeing a reduction in the frequency of services. This will have a major impact on commuters who rely on trams to get to work and school. The cuts are being blamed on a combination of factors, including the rising cost of fuel and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, critics say that the government has failed to provide adequate funding for public transport, which is an essential service for many people. The cuts are likely to have a significant impact on the economy, as well as on the lives of individual passengers. Businesses will be affected by the increased cost and reduced availability of public transport, while passengers will find it more difficult and expensive to get around. The government has said that it is committed to supporting public transport, but it has not yet announced any concrete plans to address the funding crisis. In the meantime, the cuts are continuing to take effect, and the future of public transport in the UK is uncertain. Transport operators have called on the government to provide urgent funding to prevent further cuts and to ensure the future of public transport.

The former prime minister said he had been ""motivated by a desire to help British businesses"" and that he had acted ""in good faith."" Cameron admitted that he had ""made mistakes"" and that he ""could have handled things better.""

The Princess and the Poitín,"In the quaint Irish countryside, where rolling hills met glistening lakes, a tale unfolded that intertwined royalty and illicit spirits. It was the story of the enigmatic Princess Anne and the infamous poitín. Princess Anne, renowned for her beauty and regal bearing, was an anomaly in the bustling capital of Dublin. Her heart yearned for the serenity of her ancestral home, Castle Haddon, nestled in the heart of the Wicklow Mountains. Unbeknownst to her court, Anne harbored a secret penchant for poitín, a potent Irish moonshine. Its fiery taste and intoxicating effects had become her guilty pleasure, a lifeline to her wild and rebellious spirit. Meanwhile, deep within the secluded valleys, Seamus MacMahon, a notorious poitín distiller, skillfully crafted his potent brew. His secret still, hidden amidst the ancient forest, produced an elixir that locals whispered possessed magical qualities. One fateful night, as the princess ventured into the forest to escape the confines of her castle, she stumbled upon Seamus's illicit operation. Intrigued by the tantalizing aroma, she cautiously approached. Seamus, taken aback by the sight of a princess in his humble abode, initially hesitated. But as he poured Anne a generous glass of poitín, a bond began to form between the two unlikely companions. Over the following weeks, Anne became a regular visitor to Seamus's still. She relished the warmth and camaraderie of the locals who gathered there, sharing stories and laughter while sipping on poitín. However, their secret rendezvous could not remain hidden forever. Rumors of the princess's affinity for illicit spirits soon reached the ears of the royal court. Outraged, Anne's father, King James, dispatched a detachment of guards to arrest Seamus. As the guards approached Seamus's hideout, Anne defied her father's orders and rode to his defense. A fierce battle ensued, with Anne's spirited intervention saving Seamus from capture. In the aftermath of the conflict, King James reluctantly acknowledged the bond between his daughter and the poitín distiller. Recognizing the futility of trying to separate them, he granted Seamus his freedom and allowed Anne to return to her secret rendezvous.

Syria rebels 'break government siege' of Aleppo,"Syrian rebels break government siege of Aleppo By BBC News Aleppo, Syria - Syrian rebels have broken a government siege of the eastern part of Aleppo, a major victory for the opposition in the country's five-year civil war. The rebels breached the siege on Saturday, after weeks of intense fighting. They were able to break through the government's defenses and open a corridor into the besieged area. The breach of the siege is a significant setback for the Syrian government, which has been trying to retake the city for months. It is also a major boost for the rebels, who have been struggling to hold onto their territory in recent weeks. The siege had been in place for more than two months, and had cut off food, water, and medical supplies to hundreds of thousands of civilians. The UN had warned that the siege could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. The breaking of the siege is a major relief to the people of eastern Aleppo. They had been living under constant bombardment from government forces, and many had been forced to flee their homes. The rebels are now in control of a large part of eastern Aleppo, but the fighting is still ongoing. The government is still in control of the western part of the city, and it is unclear if the rebels will be able to take full control of the city. The Syrian civil war has been going on for five years, and has killed more than 250,000 people. The war has also displaced millions of people, and has created a humanitarian crisis in the region. The breaking of the siege of Aleppo is a glimmer of hope for the people of Syria. It shows that the rebels are still capable of fighting the government, and it gives the people of Aleppo a chance to rebuild their lives. However, the war is not over yet.

Macfarlane was part of a group of four Scottish students who took the stone from Westminster Abbey in London, where it had been kept for centuries. They brought it back to Scotland and hid it in Arbroath Abbey for three months before it was eventually recovered by the authorities. The stone, also known as the Stone of Scone, is an ancient symbol of Scottish nationhood. It was used for centuries in the coronation of Scottish kings and was seen as a symbol of Scotland's independence. Macfarlane's actions were seen as a symbolic act of defiance against English rule and helped to inspire the Scottish nationalist movement. She became a folk hero in Scotland and her story was told in the 2008 film ""Stone of Destiny"". Macfarlane was born in Glasgow in 1934 and studied at the University of Edinburgh. She was a lifelong supporter of Scottish independence and was a member of the Scottish National Party. In a statement, the SNP said: ""Catherine Macfarlane was a true Scottish heroine.

Red Peak: New Zealanders rally behind 'fifth' flag design,"Red Peak: New Zealanders Rally Behind 'Fifth' Flag Design A new flag design, known as ""Red Peak,"" has emerged as a frontrunner in New Zealand's ongoing flag debate. The design, created by Kyle Lockwood, has garnered widespread support online and has become a symbol of national unity. The Red Peak flag features a bold red triangle on a white background, with the stars of the Southern Cross positioned in the upper left corner. The triangle is said to represent the country's mountains, while the stars symbolize New Zealand's Polynesian heritage. The design has been praised for its simplicity and elegance, as well as its strong visual impact. It has also been seen as a compromise between those who favor a flag that retains the Union Jack and those who prefer a more modern and distinctive design. Lockwood, a 29-year-old designer from Wellington, created the flag as part of the government's ""New Zealand Flag Referendum"" process. The referendum, which is expected to be held in late 2016 or early 2017, will ask New Zealanders to vote on whether they want to change the country's flag. If approved, the Red Peak flag would replace the current flag, which features the British Union Jack in the upper left corner and four stars representing the Southern Cross. The Union Jack was added to the flag in 1834 when New Zealand became a British colony. The flag debate has been ongoing for decades, with various designs being proposed over the years. The current flag has been criticized for its colonial associations and for being too similar to the flags of other British colonies. The Red Peak design has received strong support from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister John Key has praised the design, calling it ""a strong contender."" Opposition leader Andrew Little has also expressed support for the flag, saying that it ""reflects our values and our identity."" Online polls have also shown strong support for the Red Peak flag. A recent poll by the New Zealand Herald found that 45% of respondents preferred the design, compared to 32% who favored the current flag. The flag referendum is likely to be a closely fought contest. However, the Red Peak design has emerged as a clear frontrunner and could well become the new flag of New Zealand.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Why politicians still dream of controlling the internet,"In the digital age, the internet has become an indispensable tool, connecting people across borders, facilitating global communication, and empowering individuals with access to information. However, this profound connectivity has also exposed fundamental fault lines in our society, with concerns mounting over data privacy, misinformation, and online extremism. Amid these challenges, some politicians have succumbed to the allure of controlling the internet, driven by a desire for order, security, and political gain. The quest for control manifests in various forms, ranging from censorship and surveillance to platform regulation and algorithmic manipulation. Arguments for internet control often revolve around the need to protect citizens from harmful content and ensure national security. Governments assert that regulating online spaces is crucial to combat terrorism, hate speech, and the spread of false information. They argue that unchecked internet access can lead to social unrest, political polarization, and even violence. Proponents of a controlled internet also point to the rise of digital monopolies, which they contend stifle competition and limit consumer choice. They suggest that government intervention is necessary to ensure a level playing field and promote a more diverse and vibrant online ecosystem. However, the pursuit of internet control carries significant risks. Critics argue that censorship and surveillance can stifle free speech, undermine privacy, and create a chilling effect on online discourse. They point to examples of authoritarian regimes using internet control to suppress dissent and maintain power. Furthermore, attempts to regulate the internet often prove complex and counterproductive. Technology is constantly evolving, making it difficult for governments to keep pace and effectively enforce regulations. Moreover, the global nature of the internet makes it challenging to apply national laws to online content and platforms. Instead of seeking to control the internet, policymakers should focus on fostering a healthy and responsible digital environment. This includes promoting digital literacy, supporting independent journalism, and encouraging critical thinking skills. Governments should also work with industry leaders to develop ethical standards for online content and platform behavior. Ultimately, the internet is a double-edged sword. While it offers immense opportunities for progress and connection, it also presents challenges that require careful consideration. Rather than seeking to control the internet, policymakers should embrace its transformative power and work to mitigate its risks through responsible policies and collaborative efforts.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Google fights French 'right to be forgotten' order,"Google has filed a legal challenge against a French data protection order that requires it to remove search results about people from its global search engine. The order, issued by France's data protection agency, the CNIL, follows a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 that gave people the ""right to be forgotten"" online. The ECJ ruling said that individuals could ask search engines to remove links to information about them from search results if the information was inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive. Google has complied with the order in France, but it has argued that it should not be required to remove results from its global search engine. The company says that doing so would violate the free speech rights of people who have published the information, and that it would also make it more difficult for people to find information about important topics. In its legal challenge, Google is arguing that the CNIL's order is disproportionate and that it does not take into account the public interest in accessing information. The company is also arguing that the order is not clear about what kind of information must be removed, and that it would be difficult to implement. The CNIL has defended its order, saying that it is necessary to protect people's privacy and that Google has not taken sufficient steps to comply with the ECJ ruling. The case is likely to be closely watched by other data protection authorities in Europe, as they grapple with the implications of the ECJ's ""right to be forgotten"" ruling. The ruling has sparked a debate about the balance between the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression online. Supporters of the ruling say that it is necessary to protect people from having their personal information shared without their consent. Critics of the ruling say that it could lead to the censorship of legitimate information and that it could make it more difficult for people to find information about important topics. The outcome of Google's legal challenge could have a significant impact on the way that search engines operate in Europe and beyond.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Red defeat in Belarus Xmas 'star wars',"Red defeat in Belarus Xmas 'star wars' Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Minsk, Belarus, on Christmas Day in defiance of a government ban, in the latest protests against the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko. The demonstrators, many of whom waved the red-and-white flag of the Belarusian opposition, chanted ""Long live Belarus!"" and ""Resign!"" as they marched through the city center. The protests, which began in August after a disputed presidential election, have been met with a brutal crackdown by the Belarusian authorities. Security forces used water cannons, tear gas, and stun grenades to disperse protesters, and thousands have been arrested. Despite the risks, the protesters have continued to take to the streets, calling for Lukashenko's resignation and new elections. The protests have been fueled by anger over the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and human rights. The Christmas Day protests were the largest in months, and they underscore the growing frustration with Lukashenko's rule. The protests have also drawn international attention, with the United States and the European Union condemning the government's crackdown. In a statement, the US State Department said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the violence against protesters in Belarus. The statement called on the Belarusian authorities to ""respect the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression"" and to ""release all political prisoners."" The EU has also condemned the government's crackdown and has imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials. The protests in Belarus have been dubbed the ""star wars"" because of the protesters' use of fireworks and lasers to confound the security forces. The protests have also been marked by a high level of creativity, with protesters using street theater, music, and art to express their opposition to the government. Despite the government's crackdown, the protests in Belarus are ongoing. The protesters are determined to continue fighting for their rights, and they are calling on the international community to support their cause.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
"US creates 242,000 jobs in February","The United States economy surged in February, adding 242,000 jobs, significantly exceeding expectations and marking the strongest monthly job growth in a year. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6%, near the lowest level in 50 years. The surge in hiring was broad-based, with gains across various sectors. Leisure and hospitality led the way with 128,000 new jobs, followed by professional and business services (60,000) and construction (28,000). Notably, manufacturing added 18,000 jobs, indicating a continued recovery in the industry. Despite the robust job growth, average hourly earnings rose by just 0.1%, suggesting that wage pressures may be easing. Over the past 12 months, average earnings have increased by 3.4%, slightly above the current rate of inflation. The strong labor market report comes as a welcome sign for the Federal Reserve, which has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. It indicates that the economy can withstand tighter monetary policy without a significant slowdown in hiring. However, economists caution that the labor market remains tight, and it is too early to declare victory over inflation. They argue that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates gradually to bring inflation under control. The robust job growth also raises concerns about a possible overheating of the economy. Some economists argue that the Fed may need to act more aggressively to curb inflation and prevent an economic slowdown later on. In conclusion, the US job market is showing remarkable resilience, with strong hiring across various sectors. While this is positive news for workers and the economy, it presents challenges for policymakers as they navigate the delicate balance between promoting growth and controlling inflation.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Creative Scotland funding system 'below expected standard',"Creative Scotland's funding system has been found to be ""below expected standard"" in a new report by the country's spending watchdog. The Audit Scotland report found that the system is ""not fit for purpose"" and ""does not provide value for money"". It also found that the system is ""overly complex"" and ""lacks transparency"". The report has been welcomed by the Scottish Government, which has pledged to take action to address the findings. However, the opposition has called for the funding system to be scrapped and replaced with a new one. Creative Scotland is the public body responsible for funding the arts, screen and creative industries in Scotland. It distributes around £100 million of funding each year. The Audit Scotland report looked at how Creative Scotland allocates funding, how it monitors the impact of its funding, and how it reports on its performance. The report found that Creative Scotland's funding system is ""not fit for purpose"" because it does not meet the needs of the arts, screen and creative industries in Scotland. The report also found that the system ""does not provide value for money"" because it is not effective in achieving its objectives. The report found that the funding system is ""overly complex"" and ""lacks transparency"". This makes it difficult for applicants to understand how funding decisions are made and for the public to scrutinise Creative Scotland's spending. The report made a number of recommendations for how Creative Scotland can improve its funding system. These include: Simplifying the funding system Making the funding system more transparent Improving the way that Creative Scotland monitors the impact of its funding Improving the way that Creative Scotland reports on its performance The Scottish Government has welcomed the report and has pledged to take action to address the findings.

Russia says Turkey 'shot down plane for IS oil',"Russia has accused Turkey of deliberately shooting down one of its planes on the Syrian border to protect its illegal oil trade with Islamic State. The Turkish government has strongly denied the claims, saying the plane was shot down because it was conducting an airstrike on ethnic Turkmens in northern Syria. Russia's claims come amid heightened tensions between the two countries following the incident on Tuesday. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that he will not apologise for shooting down the plane, which he said violated Turkish airspace. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that the incident will have ""serious consequences"" for bilateral relations. Turkey's foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to protest against the accusations. The ministry said in a statement: ""We strongly reject these allegations, which are completely untrue. The Russian aircraft violated our airspace and we were forced to take action to protect our national security."" Russia has presented no evidence to support the claim that Turkey is trading oil with IS. The US has said that it is investigating the incident but has not yet reached a conclusion. However, the US has previously accused Turkey of buying oil from IS. In September, The New York Times reported that the US government had presented Turkey with intelligence showing that senior Turkish officials were involved in the oil trade. Turkey has denied the allegations. The incident has raised tensions between Russia and Turkey, which are on opposing sides of the Syrian civil war. Russia is backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey is supporting rebel groups fighting to overthrow him. The downing of the plane has also raised fears that the two countries could be drawn into a direct conflict. Russia has already deployed additional aircraft to its base in Syria, while Turkey has said it will retaliate if it is attacked. The incident has also put a strain on relations between Russia and NATO, of which Turkey is a member. NATO has condemned the downing of the plane and has called for Russia to respect Turkish airspace. Russia has said that it will not apologise for the incident and has accused NATO of taking a hostile attitude towards it.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Russian military plane crash in Syria kills dozens,"Russian Military Plane Crash in Syria Kills Dozens A Russian military plane has crashed in Syria, killing at least 39 people. The plane, an Antonov An-26, was carrying 33 passengers and six crew members when it went down shortly after taking off from the Hmeimim airbase in western Syria on Tuesday. The Russian Defense Ministry said the plane crashed due to a ""technical malfunction."" The ministry did not provide further details, but the Russian news agency Interfax reported that the plane had caught fire in the air. The crash is the deadliest single incident involving Russian forces in Syria since the start of the country's civil war in 2011. Russia has been a major supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the conflict. Russian forces have been operating in Syria since 2015, providing air support to Assad's forces and targeting rebel groups. The crash of the An-26 comes at a time when Russia is already facing increasing pressure over its role in Syria. Western countries have accused Russia of war crimes, including the bombing of civilian targets. The United States has also expressed concern about Russia's growing military presence in Syria. In October, the US military shot down a Russian jet that had entered US-controlled airspace in eastern Syria. The crash of the An-26 is likely to further strain relations between Russia and Western countries. It is also a reminder of the risks involved in Russia's military intervention in Syria. The crash is also a blow to Russia's military prestige. The An-26 is a reliable and widely used transport aircraft, and its loss will be felt by the Russian military. The crash is also a tragedy for the families of the victims. The passengers on the plane were military personnel and civilian contractors who were working in Syria. The Russian Defense Ministry has expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and pledged to provide them with support. The crash is a reminder of the dangers faced by Russian forces in Syria. The country's civil war has been raging for over seven years, and there is no end in sight.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

India police discover elephant smuggling racket,"India Police Uncover Elephant Smuggling Ring In a major breakthrough, Indian authorities have dismantled a sophisticated elephant smuggling racket operating across the country. Law enforcement officials conducted raids in multiple locations, leading to the arrest of several suspects and the seizure of nine elephants. The investigation began after intelligence agencies received reports of illegal elephant trade activities. The suspects allegedly captured elephants from forests and sold them to wealthy individuals, primarily in the Middle East. During the raid, police discovered a network of handlers who managed the capture, transportation, and sale of the elephants. The animals were often transported across state borders using trucks or rail wagons, with their tusks and other body parts removed to avoid detection. The smuggling racket is believed to have been operating for several years, threatening the country's elephant population. Elephants are protected under Indian law, and poaching for their ivory or other body parts is a serious offense. The Indian government has intensified its efforts to combat wildlife crime in recent years, recognizing the threats it poses to endangered species and the environment. The discovery of this smuggling ring is a testament to the commitment of law enforcement agencies to protect the nation's wildlife. According to wildlife experts, elephant smuggling is driven by demand for ivory and other body parts, particularly in countries where they are used for traditional medicine or decorative purposes. The illegal trade also fuels corruption and organized crime. The captured elephants have been transferred to rehabilitation centers, where they will receive necessary medical care and undergo a rehabilitation process to prepare them for a life back in the wild. The arrested suspects face charges of wildlife smuggling, poaching, and animal cruelty. The Indian authorities have expressed their determination to crack down on wildlife crime and protect the country's precious wildlife heritage. The successful operation against the elephant smuggling racket sends a strong message that such activities will not be tolerated.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

Lord Kilclooney clarifies 'not political equals' tweet,"Lord Kilclooney clarifies 'not political equals' tweet Ulster Unionist peer Lord Kilclooney has clarified his controversial tweet suggesting that unionists and nationalists are not ""political equals"". Lord Kilclooney, a former Stormont minister, made the comment on Twitter on Monday, sparking a backlash from some quarters. In his tweet, Lord Kilclooney said: ""Unionists and Nationalists are not political equals. One section of our community voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the UK, the other overwhelmingly to leave."" The tweet was widely interpreted as suggesting that unionists were superior to nationalists, and was condemned by some as divisive and sectarian. However, Lord Kilclooney has since clarified his remarks, saying that he was not referring to the relative merits of each community, but to the different political goals they have. He said: ""I was simply stating a fact. Unionists want to remain part of the UK, while nationalists want to leave. These are two different political goals, and they cannot be equated."" Lord Kilclooney also said that he believes that all citizens of Northern Ireland are equal, regardless of their political beliefs. He said: ""I have always believed that all citizens of Northern Ireland are equal, and I have always worked to promote peace and reconciliation in our community. ""My tweet was not intended to be divisive, and I regret if it has caused offense."" Lord Kilclooney's clarification has been welcomed by some, but others remain critical of his original tweet. The Alliance Party's Deputy Leader, Stephen Farry, said that Lord Kilclooney's remarks were ""deeply offensive"" and that they ""undermine the very foundations of our democracy"". However, the Democratic Unionist Party's leader, Arlene Foster, defended Lord Kilclooney, saying that he was ""entitled to his opinion"". The controversy over Lord Kilclooney's tweet highlights the deep divisions that still exist in Northern Ireland over the issue of constitutional status. While the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland now support the Good Friday Agreement and the power-sharing institutions that it created, there are still some who believe that the union with the UK should be dissolved. These divisions are likely to continue to be a source of tension in Northern Ireland for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Theresa May in renewed effort to close gender pay gap,"In a renewed effort to tackle the persistent gender pay gap, Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a series of measures aimed at boosting pay transparency, supporting women in the workplace, and encouraging businesses to take action. One of the key measures is the introduction of mandatory gender pay gap reporting for all companies with 250 or more employees. This will require companies to publish the difference between the average hourly pay of male and female employees, as well as the proportion of men and women in each quartile of their workforce. The government will also introduce a new code of practice on equal pay, which will provide guidance to employers on how to comply with the law and create a fairer workplace. The code will include measures to ensure that women are not paid less than men for the same work, and that they have equal opportunities for promotion and progression. In addition, the government will provide £5 million to fund a new initiative to support women in starting and growing their own businesses. This will include mentoring, training, and networking opportunities for women entrepreneurs. Theresa May said: ""The gender pay gap is a persistent injustice that holds women back and damages our economy. We are committed to tackling this issue and creating a fairer workplace for everyone."" The TUC welcomed the government's announcement, saying that it was a ""step in the right direction."" However, the union called for further action, including measures to tackle the ""pay secrecy"" that often prevents women from knowing how much their male colleagues earn. The CBI, which represents businesses, said that it supported the government's goal of closing the gender pay gap. However, the CBI warned that the mandatory reporting of gender pay gaps could be ""counterproductive"" if it led to companies simply ""box-ticking"" rather than taking meaningful action. The gender pay gap in the UK currently stands at 18.4%, meaning that women earn on average 18.4% less than men. The gap is particularly large in some sectors, such as finance and technology. The government's measures are designed to help close the gender pay gap by making it easier for women to compare their salaries with those of their male colleagues, by providing support to women who want to start their own businesses, and by encouraging businesses to take action to create a fairer workplace.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

The government said it ""recognises the challenges"" faced by steelworkers, but it is ""not possible"" to extend the deadline. The decision comes after the government was urged to extend the deadline by the steelworkers' union, Community. Community said that the deadline was ""unfair"" and that many steelworkers were still waiting for information about their pensions. The union also said that the government had not done enough to help steelworkers understand the options available to them. However, the government said that it had ""provided extensive support"" to steelworkers, including setting up a dedicated helpline and providing information online. The government also said that it had ""engaged with Community and other stakeholders throughout the process"". The BSPS is a defined benefit pension scheme, which means that members are guaranteed a certain level of income in retirement. However, the scheme has been in deficit for a number of years, and the government has said that it is not sustainable in its current form. The government has offered steelworkers a choice of two options: Transfer their pension to a new scheme, which would be run by an insurance company. Stay in the current scheme, which would be restructured to make it more sustainable. The government has said that both options are ""fair and affordable"". However, Community has said that the government's offer is ""not good enough"" and that it will continue to campaign for a better deal for steelworkers.

Japan whaling ban welcomed in Australia and New Zealand,"Japan whaling ban welcomed in Australia and New Zealand The Australian and New Zealand governments have welcomed Japan's decision to end commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. The decision was announced by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Panama City. Australia's Environment Minister Sussan Ley said the decision was a ""significant step forward"" for whale conservation. ""This is a victory for whales and for all those who have campaigned for their protection,"" she said. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said the decision was a ""positive outcome"" for the whales and for the region. ""We have long called for an end to commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean, and we are pleased that Japan has finally agreed to stop,"" she said. The IWC has been trying to ban commercial whaling since 1986, but Japan has continued to hunt whales under a loophole that allows for ""scientific research"". However, Japan has faced increasing international pressure to end its whaling program, and the IWC has been considering a proposal to close the loophole. Japan's decision to end commercial whaling is a significant victory for whale conservationists. It is estimated that around 10,000 whales have been killed by Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean since 1986. The decision is also a boost for the Australian and New Zealand governments, which have been working for many years to end commercial whaling in the region. The Australian and New Zealand governments have both committed to providing financial assistance to Japan to help it transition to non-lethal whale research. The decision is also a victory for the whales themselves. Whales are highly intelligent and social animals, and they play an important role in the marine ecosystem. The end of commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean will help to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure that they can continue to thrive in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

AMs' report highlights gaps in muscular dystrophy care,"Muscular Dystrophy UK: Report finds 'gaps' in care for people with muscular dystrophy A new report by the charity Muscular Dystrophy UK has found ""significant gaps"" in the care provided to people with muscular dystrophy (MD). The report, which surveyed over 1,000 people with MD and their families, found that many people are not receiving the care and support they need. Some of the key findings of the report include: Delays in diagnosis: Many people with MD experience delays in diagnosis, which can lead to a delay in accessing appropriate care and support. Lack of access to specialist care: Many people with MD do not have access to specialist care, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their condition and its management. Inadequate support for families: Many families of people with MD do not receive adequate support, which can lead to significant stress and financial hardship. The report also found that people with MD are more likely to experience mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. The report concludes that there is a need for a ""step change"" in the care provided to people with MD. It calls for a number of improvements, including: Earlier diagnosis: The report calls for earlier diagnosis of MD, so that people can access appropriate care and support as soon as possible. Increased access to specialist care: The report calls for increased access to specialist care for people with MD, so that they can receive the best possible care and support. Improved support for families: The report calls for improved support for families of people with MD, so that they can cope with the challenges of caring for a loved one with MD.

Mitsubishi Motors: How did it falsify its fuel economy data?,"Mitsubishi Motors: How did it falsify its fuel economy data? In 2016, Mitsubishi Motors admitted to falsifying fuel economy data on four of its minicar models, resulting in a major scandal that tarnished the company's reputation and shook the Japanese auto industry. An investigation revealed a widespread pattern of deception, with employees instructed to manipulate test results to meet government targets for fuel efficiency. How it happened Mitsubishi's fuel economy deception involved two main methods: Engine idling: During fuel economy tests, the vehicles were put into a special ""economy mode"" that idled the engine more frequently, resulting in artificially inflated fuel efficiency readings. Weight reduction: The vehicles were tested with less weight than specified in the regulations, further improving fuel economy results. These practices were not limited to a few rogue employees but were reportedly sanctioned at high levels within the company. Employees were allegedly pressured to meet ambitious fuel economy targets, leading to a culture of cutting corners and falsifying data. The consequences The scandal had devastating consequences for Mitsubishi Motors: Financial losses: The company incurred billions of dollars in fines, compensation payments, and lost sales. Loss of trust: Mitsubishi's reputation was severely damaged, leading to a loss of consumer confidence and a drop in sales. Criminal charges: Several Mitsubishi executives were arrested and charged with falsifying data, resulting in prison sentences. Aftermath and reforms The Mitsubishi scandal prompted a major overhaul of the company's corporate culture and regulatory oversight in the Japanese auto industry. Mitsubishi implemented stricter internal controls, enhanced employee training, and appointed an independent auditor to monitor fuel economy testing. Government agencies also strengthened regulations and increased oversight of fuel economy tests. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) introduced new guidelines for fuel economy testing, including stricter vehicle weighing requirements and more realistic driving conditions. Lessons learned The Mitsubishi scandal highlighted the importance of ethical conduct, transparency, and regulatory compliance in the automotive industry. It demonstrated the risks of cutting corners to meet performance targets and the devastating consequences that can result from manipulating data. The scandal also underscored the need for strong corporate governance and independent oversight to prevent such misconduct from occurring in the future. By implementing comprehensive reforms and strengthening regulations, the industry has taken steps to restore trust and ensure the accuracy and integrity of fuel economy data.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

He told the BBC's Today programme that the government had ""learned its lesson"" and would do better in the future. Javid's comments come after a major public backlash against the reforms, which would have seen patients paying more for some services.

He said he wants to create a ""sustainable NHS that is there for everyone"" and that he is ""determined to make it happen"".

Boeing 787 Dreamliner: NTSB details battery fire,"Boeing 787 Dreamliner: NTSB Details Battery Fire The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released a new report on the battery fire that caused a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to make an emergency landing in Boston in 2013. The report concludes that the fire was caused by a design flaw in the battery's charging system. The NTSB found that the battery's charging system was not able to regulate the voltage properly, which caused the battery to overheat and catch fire. The report also found that Boeing had not adequately tested the charging system before the plane was put into service. The NTSB's findings are consistent with those of an earlier investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In 2014, the FAA ordered all Boeing 787 Dreamliners to be grounded until the battery problem was fixed. Boeing has since redesigned the battery charging system and the planes have been returned to service. The NTSB's report is a reminder of the importance of thorough testing and oversight in the aviation industry. The battery fire on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner could have had catastrophic consequences if it had not been detected and extinguished quickly. The NTSB's report also highlights the need for continued research into battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including laptops, cell phones, and electric cars. As the demand for these devices grows, so too does the need for safe and reliable battery technology. The NTSB's report on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery fire is a valuable contribution to the safety of the aviation industry. The report's findings will help to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. Additional Information from the NTSB Report The battery fire on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner occurred on January 7, 2013. The plane was carrying 182 passengers and crew members. The plane made an emergency landing at Logan International Airport in Boston. No one was injured in the incident. The NTSB's investigation into the battery fire took two years to complete.

Flat-dwelling children exposed to neighbours' smoke too,"Flat-dwelling children exposed to neighbours' smoke too When it comes to protecting children from the dangers of secondhand smoke, most parents focus on keeping their own homes smoke-free. But new research suggests that children who live in flats may also be exposed to harmful levels of smoke from neighbouring apartments. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that children who lived in flats were exposed to higher levels of secondhand smoke than those who lived in houses. The researchers believe that this is because smoke can easily seep through the walls and floors of flats, even if the neighbouring apartment is smoke-free. ""Our findings suggest that children who live in flats may be at increased risk for exposure to secondhand smoke,"" said study author Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. ""This is a concern because secondhand smoke exposure has been linked to a number of health problems in children, including respiratory problems, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome."" The study included over 1,000 children between the ages of 6 and 17. The researchers measured the levels of cotinine, a chemical that is produced when nicotine is broken down in the body, in the children's urine. Cotinine levels are a measure of secondhand smoke exposure. The researchers found that children who lived in flats had higher levels of cotinine in their urine than those who lived in houses. The difference in cotinine levels was even greater for children who lived in flats with smokers in the neighbouring apartment. ""Our findings suggest that children who live in flats may need to take additional steps to protect themselves from secondhand smoke exposure,"" said Winickoff. ""This could include using air purifiers, closing windows and doors, and avoiding spending time in areas where smoking is allowed."" The study is the first to examine the exposure of flat-dwelling children to secondhand smoke from neighbouring apartments. The findings suggest that this is a significant problem that could have a negative impact on the health of children. ""Our findings highlight the need for more research on the health effects of secondhand smoke exposure in flat-dwelling children,"" said Winickoff.

Romania protests: Thousands hold fresh rallies after clashes,"Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Bucharest and other Romanian cities to protest for a second day, following violent clashes with police the night before. The demonstrations were sparked by a government decree to decriminalize some forms of corruption, which critics say would allow corrupt politicians to escape justice. On Tuesday night, police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters in Bucharest, injuring dozens of people. Interior Minister Carmen Dan has defended the police's actions, saying that they were necessary to maintain order. However, the violence has only served to further anger protesters, who have vowed to continue demonstrating until the government withdraws the decree. On Wednesday, protesters gathered in Victory Square in central Bucharest, holding Romanian flags and chanting slogans such as ""Thieves!"" and ""Resign!"". Similar protests were held in other cities, including Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, and Iasi. The Romanian government has come under increasing pressure to resign in recent months, following a series of corruption scandals. In October, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu was forced to resign after just six months in office, following mass protests against his government's austerity measures. The current government, led by Mihai Tudose, has also been rocked by corruption scandals. In December, the justice minister was forced to resign after being accused of taking bribes. The protests in Romania are the latest in a wave of anti-corruption demonstrations that have swept across Eastern Europe in recent years. In 2015, mass protests in Bulgaria forced the government to resign. And in 2016, similar protests in Slovakia led to the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico.

Eurotunnel accused of overcharging train companies,"The Eurotunnel, the underwater rail link between Britain and France, has been accused of overcharging train companies by up to £30m a year. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the company's pricing practices, following a complaint from the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators. The RDG alleges that Eurotunnel has been charging excessive tolls for trains using the tunnel, which has led to higher fares for passengers. Eurotunnel has denied the allegations, saying that its prices are ""fair and reasonable"". However, the CMA has said that it has ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that Eurotunnel may have infringed competition law. The investigation will now look at whether Eurotunnel has abused its dominant position in the market and whether it has charged excessive prices. The CMA has the power to impose fines of up to 10% of a company's annual turnover if it finds that it has infringed competition law. The Eurotunnel is a vital link between Britain and Europe, and it is used by millions of passengers and freight trains every year. The CMA's investigation could have a significant impact on the cost of travel between the two countries. The Eurotunnel was privatized in 1995 and is now owned by a consortium of investors. The company has a monopoly on the rail link between Britain and France, and it sets the tolls that train operators must pay to use the tunnel.

Speaking at a business event in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump said he was ""renegotiating"" the deal and that he wanted to see ""a fair deal for the United States"". He added that he believed the US could do ""much better"" under a revised agreement. The announcement came after months of speculation about the future of Nafta, which has been in place since 1994. Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the US from the deal, calling it a ""disaster"" for American workers. However, he has also said that he is open to renegotiating the agreement. The US, Canada and Mexico have been holding talks to update Nafta, but little progress has been made. The three countries are trying to reach a deal before the end of the year, when Mexico's presidential election campaign begins. Mr Trump's latest comments suggest that he is willing to give the negotiations more time. However, he also warned that he would not hesitate to withdraw the US from Nafta if he did not get a deal that he was happy with. ""If we don't get a fair deal, we will terminate Nafta,"" he said.

Greta Thunberg: New beetle named after climate activist,"Greta Thunberg: New beetle named after climate activist A newly discovered species of beetle has been named after Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in recognition of her tireless efforts to raise awareness about the climate crisis. The insect, known as Nelloptodes gretae, is a tiny, flightless beetle found in the rainforests of Kenya. It belongs to the family of ground beetles, which are known for their hard exoskeletons and ability to thrive in diverse habitats. The discovery and naming of the beetle was made by a team of researchers from the Natural History Museum in London and the University of Turku in Finland. They chose the name ""gretae"" to honor Thunberg's unwavering commitment to protecting the planet. Lead researcher Dr. Martin Brendell said, ""We were inspired by Greta's passion and determination in speaking out about the urgent need to address climate change. By naming this beetle after her, we hope to recognize her important work and inspire others to follow in her footsteps."" The Nelloptodes gretae beetle is a small, black insect with a distinctive pattern of ridges and grooves on its back. It measures just a few millimeters in length and is adapted to living in the leaf litter of rainforest floors. While the beetle may not be particularly conspicuous or charismatic, Dr. Brendell emphasizes its importance as part of the rainforest ecosystem. ""Ground beetles play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil health, and they serve as a food source for other animals,"" he explained. Thunberg has expressed gratitude for the honor, saying, ""It's amazing to think that a beetle has been named after me. I hope it reminds people that even the smallest creatures are affected by climate change, and that we all have a responsibility to protect our planet."" The naming of the beetle after Thunberg also highlights the growing recognition of the role that young people are playing in the fight against climate change. Thunberg's activism has inspired countless individuals, young and old, to speak out and demand action. By naming a beetle after her, the researchers hope to inspire future generations of scientists, conservationists, and activists to continue Thunberg's legacy of environmental stewardship. They believe that the beetle's name will serve as a reminder that even small actions can make a big difference in the fight against climate change.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Portishead-Bristol line restoration gets funding boost,"Portishead-Bristol line restoration gets funding boost The restoration of the Portishead-Bristol line has received a significant funding boost, bringing the long-awaited project closer to reality. The Department for Transport has awarded £20 million to Network Rail to progress the scheme, which aims to reinstate passenger services between Portishead and Bristol Temple Meads. The funding will cover the development of detailed plans and the start of construction work. The Portishead-Bristol line was closed in 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe, a widespread reduction in Britain's railway network. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to reopen the line, but these have failed to secure the necessary funding. The restoration project has been welcomed by local communities and businesses, who believe it will improve connectivity and boost the local economy. The line is expected to carry up to 4,000 passengers per day and create approximately 1,000 jobs during construction. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: ""This funding boost is a major step forward in delivering the Portishead-Bristol line restoration. It will improve transport links for local communities and businesses, while also creating new jobs and supporting economic growth."" The project involves the construction of a new 6.5-mile section of railway between Portishead and Pill, as well as the refurbishment of existing track and stations. The line will be electrified, enabling the use of electric trains. Network Rail's Western region managing director, Mark Langman, said: ""We are delighted to have secured this funding, which will allow us to progress the restoration of the Portishead-Bristol line. This is a complex and challenging project, but we are committed to delivering it for the benefit of the local community and the wider region."" The restoration project is scheduled to be completed by 2025. Once operational, the line will provide a vital link between Portishead and Bristol, reducing journey times and providing increased access to jobs, education, and leisure opportunities. The Portishead-Bristol line restoration is one of a number of rail projects that have received funding from the government in recent months. This includes the electrification of the Midland Main Line and the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham. The government's investment in rail infrastructure is part of its wider commitment to improving transport links and supporting economic growth throughout the country.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Difficult day for prime minister but not a disaster,"In the wake of the Prime Minister's difficult day in Parliament, it is important to note that while the events were undoubtedly challenging, they do not constitute a disaster. The Prime Minister faced a barrage of criticism from both the opposition and members of his own party, and was forced to make a number of concessions. However, it is important to remember that the government still has a majority in the House of Commons, and that the Prime Minister remains in office. The Prime Minister's difficulties began with the release of a report by the Privileges Committee, which found that he had misled Parliament over his knowledge of parties held in Downing Street during lockdown. This led to calls for his resignation from both the opposition and some members of his own party. The Prime Minister apologized for his actions, but refused to resign. The Prime Minister's difficulties continued in the House of Commons, where he faced a grilling from the opposition leader. The Prime Minister was forced to admit that he had made a mistake, and that he had let people down. He also said that he was ""determined to fix things."" Later in the day, the Prime Minister was dealt another blow when one of his most senior ministers, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, resigned. The Chancellor said that he could no longer support the Prime Minister, and that he believed that the government was ""going in the wrong direction."" The Prime Minister's difficult day ended with a vote of confidence in his leadership. The Prime Minister won the vote, but with a reduced majority. This means that he is now more vulnerable to further challenges from within his own party. Despite the Prime Minister's difficult day, it is important to note that he remains in office. He has a majority in the House of Commons, and he has the support of many members of his party. It is possible that he will be able to weather the storm and continue to lead the government. However, it is also possible that his position will become untenable, and that he will be forced to resign. Only time will tell what the future holds for the Prime Minister.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Bonmarché appoints administrators,"Bonmarché Appoints Administrators Popular British retailer Bonmarché has appointed administrators, marking a sad day for the high street chain and its thousands of employees. The company, which operates 245 stores across the UK, has been struggling in recent years amid the challenging retail environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The news of Bonmarché's administration is a blow to the British retail sector, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Many high street retailers have been forced to close stores or go into administration in recent months. Bonmarché is the latest in a long line of well-known names to fall victim to the changing consumer landscape. Bonmarché was founded in 1982 and has a loyal customer base, particularly among older shoppers. The company sells a range of clothing, homeware, and accessories at affordable prices. However, it has faced increasing competition from online retailers and fast-fashion chains in recent years. In a statement, Bonmarché said that it had been ""exploring all available options"" to secure the future of the business. However, it was unable to reach an agreement with its lenders and has now appointed administrators from FRP Advisory. The administrators will now be responsible for assessing the company's financial position and exploring options for its future. It is possible that some Bonmarché stores will be closed and jobs will be lost. The news of Bonmarché's administration is a reminder of the challenges facing the British retail sector. Consumers are increasingly shopping online and the high street is struggling to compete. It is unclear how many more retailers will be forced to close their doors in the coming months. What happens next? The administrators will now be working to assess Bonmarché's financial position and explore options for its future. This could include selling the business, closing down stores, or reaching an agreement with creditors. It is possible that some Bonmarché stores will remain open, but it is also likely that some will be closed. The administrators will be working to minimize job losses, but it is inevitable that some staff will be made redundant. The news of Bonmarché's administration is a sad day for the company's employees and customers. It is another sign of the challenges facing the British retail sector.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Colombian government to negotiate with striking farmers,"Colombian Government to Negotiate with Striking Farmers The Colombian government has agreed to negotiate with striking farmers who have taken to the streets in protest over low crop prices and other grievances. The farmers, who began their strike on August 19, have blocked major highways and caused widespread disruptions. They are demanding government action to address their concerns, including higher prices for their products, lower input costs, and increased access to credit. The government has initially resisted the farmers' demands, but it has since agreed to negotiate after the strike began to gain momentum. The negotiations began on September 6, and both sides have expressed a willingness to reach a compromise. However, the negotiations have been hampered by the fact that the farmers' demands are wide-ranging and complex. The government has also said that it cannot meet all of the farmers' demands, especially those that would require significant increases in spending. Despite the challenges, both sides have said that they are committed to reaching a resolution. The farmers have said that they are willing to continue their strike if the government does not meet their demands, but they have also expressed a willingness to negotiate. The government has said that it is committed to resolving the strike peacefully and that it will work with the farmers to find a solution that meets their needs while also protecting the interests of the broader economy. The strike has had a significant impact on the Colombian economy. The blockades have disrupted the flow of goods and services, and have caused shortages of some products. The strike has also led to job losses and increased prices for consumers. The Colombian government has faced criticism for its handling of the strike. Some critics have said that the government was too slow to react to the farmers' demands, and that it could have done more to prevent the strike from escalating. Others have criticized the government for using excessive force against the protesters. In one incident, police fired tear gas at a group of protesters, injuring several people. The government has defended its handling of the strike, saying that it has used a proportionate response to the protests. The government has also said that it is committed to resolving the strike peacefully and through dialogue. The strike is a major test for the Colombian government. The government is trying to balance the demands of the farmers with the interests of the broader economy. The government is also facing pressure from the international community to resolve the strike peacefully and to respect the rights of the protesters.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Nuclear Posture Review: US wants smaller nukes to counter Russia,"Nuclear Posture Review: US Wants Smaller Nukes to Counter Russia The Biden administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), unveiled on Thursday, outlines a shift in US nuclear policy towards smaller, lower-yield weapons designed to deter potential adversaries like Russia. The review acknowledges the evolving nature of nuclear threats and emphasizes the need to modernize the US nuclear arsenal. Key among the changes proposed by the NPR is the development of a new sea-launched nuclear cruise missile, the SLCM-N, with a smaller warhead than existing cruise missiles. This move is seen as a direct response to Russia's development of similar weapons, which could potentially be used against US allies and partners. The NPR also calls for continued modernization of the US nuclear triad, which includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and strategic bombers. The administration plans to invest in new ICBMs, extend the service life of SLBMs, and purchase new heavy bombers to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. However, the NPR also recognizes the importance of arms control and non-proliferation. The administration remains committed to the New START treaty, which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, and is seeking to engage with Russia on a new framework for nuclear arms control. The NPR's emphasis on smaller, lower-yield weapons is a departure from previous US nuclear policy, which focused on larger, more powerful weapons. However, the administration believes that these smaller weapons provide a more credible deterrent against Russian aggression, particularly in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Critics of the NPR argue that smaller nuclear weapons could make their use more likely, as they may be seen as less destructive and therefore more acceptable. They also question the need for a new nuclear cruise missile, arguing that existing weapons are already sufficient. Despite these concerns, the NPR is likely to be welcomed by US allies and partners who have long been concerned about the threat posed by Russia's nuclear arsenal. The review's emphasis on deterrence and arms control also sends a positive signal to other nuclear powers, such as China and North Korea. The NPR represents a significant shift in US nuclear policy and could have far-reaching implications for the future of nuclear deterrence. It remains to be seen whether the administration's plans will be successful in countering Russia's nuclear threat and maintaining stability in a dangerous and uncertain world.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0
Egypt court upholds Muslim Brotherhood death sentences,"Egypt Court Upholds Muslim Brotherhood Death Sentences An Egyptian court has upheld death sentences against 12 members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, including its former leader Mohamed Badie, over deadly violence in 2013. The court also sentenced 28 other Brotherhood members to life in prison and acquitted 37. All the defendants were accused of inciting violence and murdering nine police officers in a clash with security forces following the military's ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Rights groups condemned the verdicts, calling them a ""travesty of justice"" and urging Egypt to halt all death sentences. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamist movement, was designated a terrorist organization by the government in 2013 after Morsi was removed from power. The group has been the target of a sweeping crackdown by the authorities, with thousands of its members arrested and imprisoned. Wednesday's verdict came after a highly criticized trial that lasted nearly six years. The defendants were held in pretrial detention for over four years before the trial began. They were denied access to lawyers during interrogations and were allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment. During the trial, the prosecution relied heavily on confessions, which human rights advocates say were likely coerced under duress. The defense team also argued that the evidence against the defendants was fabricated and that the violence in 2013 was largely provoked by security forces. The verdicts have drawn international condemnation, with many observers seeing them as part of the Egyptian government's wider crackdown on dissent. Human Rights Watch called the trial ""grossly unfair"" and said it ""demonstrates the Egyptian government's contempt for the rule of law."" The Egyptian government has defended its handling of the case, saying that the defendants were given a fair trial and that the verdicts were based on evidence. However, it has faced accusations of silencing political opposition and violating human rights. The verdicts are a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been struggling to rebuild its organization after the 2013 crackdown. The group's credibility has been damaged by allegations of violence and extremism, and it has faced increasing opposition from both within and outside Egypt. The verdicts are also likely to further polarize Egyptian society and fuel instability in the country. Many Egyptians see the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate political force, while others view it as a dangerous extremist organization. The government's crackdown has only exacerbated these divisions.",Ai,English,BBC,Topic,gemini-pro,0

NSA 'tracking' hundreds of millions of mobile phones,"NSA Accused of Tracking Hundreds of Millions of Mobile Phones A new report has revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) has been tracking the location data of hundreds of millions of mobile phones around the world. The report, from the privacy advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), is based on a leaked NSA document that describes a program called ""COBALT."" COBALT allows the NSA to collect and store the location data of any mobile phone that connects to a cellular network. The EFF estimates that COBALT has been collecting location data from over 200 million mobile phones in 70 countries. The data includes the phone's location, the time and date of each location fix, and the identity of the phone's owner. The NSA claims that COBALT is used to track terrorists and other national security threats. However, the EFF argues that the program is a violation of the privacy of ordinary citizens. ""The NSA is collecting vast amounts of data on the location of hundreds of millions of people around the world,"" said Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney at the EFF. ""This is a clear violation of our privacy rights."" The EFF has filed a lawsuit against the NSA, challenging the legality of COBALT. The lawsuit is currently pending in federal court. The revelations about COBALT have raised concerns about the extent of the NSA's surveillance activities. In recent years, the NSA has been accused of spying on Americans without a warrant, collecting data from phone calls and emails, and hacking into the computer systems of foreign governments. The NSA has defended its surveillance programs, arguing that they are necessary to protect national security. However, critics argue that the NSA has gone too far and that its surveillance activities are a threat to our civil liberties. The debate over the NSA's surveillance activities is likely to continue for years to come. However, the revelations about COBALT have made it clear that the NSA is collecting vast amounts of data on the location of ordinary citizens.

Campaigners and members of the public enjoyed live music, face painting and a bouncy castle, but their message was clear - they will not give up the fight to save the hospital. The Save St Helier campaign was launched last year after the Jersey government announced plans to axe inpatient children's, maternity and A&E services at the hospital. The government says the changes are needed to improve healthcare in the island, but campaigners say the plans would lead to a ""postcode lottery"" of care. Campaigner Chris Le Masurier said the government needed to listen to the people and keep services at St Helier. ""This hospital is at the heart of our community,"" he said. ""It's a place where people come for help when they need it most. We cannot let the government take that away from us."" Fellow campaigner Sarah Mallett said the fun day was a way to show the government that the people of Jersey would not give up fighting to save the hospital.

Gambling: Tougher new rules for 'bet now' adverts,"Gambling: Tougher new rules for 'bet now' adverts New rules have come into force to tackle the problem of gambling addiction, including a ban on ""bet now"" adverts during live sports broadcasts. The rules, which came into effect on 1 October, also include a ban on gambling adverts before the 9pm watershed and a requirement for gambling companies to display warnings about the risks of gambling addiction. The new rules are part of a wider crackdown on gambling advertising, which has been criticized for targeting vulnerable people and encouraging problem gambling. A study by the Gambling Commission found that the number of people addicted to gambling in the UK has increased by 50% in the past five years. The study also found that gambling addiction is more common among young people, men, and people with mental health problems. The new rules are designed to reduce the exposure of young people and vulnerable people to gambling advertising, and to make it easier for people to get help if they have a gambling problem. The ban on ""bet now"" adverts during live sports broadcasts is particularly important, as these adverts are often seen by young people. A study by the University of Stirling found that young people who are exposed to gambling advertising are more likely to gamble and to develop gambling problems. The new rules are a welcome step towards tackling the problem of gambling addiction. However, they are only part of the solution. It is also important to educate young people about the risks of gambling and to provide support for people who have a gambling problem. Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can ruin lives.

M4 relief road judicial review rejected,"M4 relief road judicial review rejected The High Court has rejected a legal challenge to the Welsh government's decision to approve the construction of the M4 relief road around Newport. The £1.3bn project, which has been in the pipeline for decades, is designed to ease congestion on the M4 motorway and improve journey times between south Wales and England. However, the plans have been opposed by environmental groups, who argue that the road will damage the environment and increase air pollution. In March 2022, Friends of the Earth Cymru and the RSPB launched a legal challenge against the Welsh government's decision to approve the road. They argued that the government had failed to properly consider the environmental impact of the road and that the project was not in the public interest. However, Mr Justice Holgate, sitting in the High Court in Cardiff, dismissed the challenge on Wednesday. He said that the Welsh government had carried out a ""thorough and detailed"" environmental assessment and that the project was in the public interest. He also said that the government had taken into account the concerns of environmental groups and had made ""significant changes"" to the plans to mitigate the impact on the environment. Friends of the Earth Cymru and the RSPB said they were ""disappointed"" by the decision but would consider their options.
