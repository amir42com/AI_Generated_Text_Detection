Set theory,"Cantor's work initially polarized the mathematicians of his day. While Karl Weierstrass and Dedekind supported Cantor, Leopold Kronecker, now seen as a founder of mathematical constructivism, did not. Cantorian set theory eventually became widespread, due to the utility of Cantorian concepts, such as one-to-one correspondence among sets, his proof that there are more real numbers than integers, and the ""infinity of infinities"" (""Cantor's paradise"") resulting from the power set operation. This utility of set theory led to the article ""Mengenlehre"" contributed in 1898 by Arthur Schoenflies to Klein's encyclopedia.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Testicle,"Spermatogenesis is enhanced at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. The spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 °C. Because the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can move them closer or further away from the body. The temperature of the testes is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures affect spermatogenesis. There are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Causal theory of reference,"Gareth Evans argued that the causal theory, or at least certain common and over-simple variants of it, have the consequence that, however remote or obscure the causal connection between someone's use of a proper name and the object it originally referred to, they still refer to that object when they use the name. (Imagine a name briefly overheard in a train or café.) The theory effectively ignores context and makes reference into a magic trick.

Patch collecting,"Badges have been collected since ancient times. Greek and Roman pilgrims to pagan shrines made collections of miniature images of gods and goddesses or their emblems, and Christian pilgrims later did the same. Usually medieval Christian pilgrim badges were metal pin badges - most famously the shell symbol showing the wearer had been to the shrine of St. James at Santiago de Compostela in Spain. These were stuck in hats or into clothing and hard working pilgrims could assemble quite a collection, as mentioned by Chaucer in his 'Canterbury Tales'.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Machine learning,"Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

This occurs because as the player loses, the average bet size in the line increases.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Ovarian cancer,"To definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Johan Sverdrup,"During the 60s, the views towards the ministers' participation in the parliamentary sessions had changed totally. The ministerials, as they were called, were now univocally against, because they had seen the formation of the peasants' friends as a threat to what they deemed to be the ideal, the totally independent representative. The peasants and the radicals on the other hand, had drawn the obviously correct conclusion that this reform would further the influence of the elected towards the appointed ministers.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Walker Evans,"Walker Evans (November 3, 1903 – April 10, 1975) was an American photographer and photojournalist best known for his work for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) documenting the effects of the Great Depression. Much of Evans's work from the FSA period uses the large-format, 8×10-inch (200×250 mm) view camera. He said that his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that are ""literate, authoritative, transcendent"".",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Retaining wall,"Retaining walls are relatively rigid walls used for supporting the soil mass laterally so that the soil can be retained at different levels on the two sides. Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Asian carp,"Asian carp have been a popular food fish in Asia for thousands of years. Some recipes are specifically for carp such as (sweet-and-sour carp) and (thick miso soup with carp). However, many people in North America do not distinguish the various Asian carp species and see them all as undesirable food fish due to their perceived bottom-feeding behavior, while, in fact, only some species are bottom-feeders, and even the bottom-feeding species such as the common carp, a highly bony species which was introduced to North America from Eurasia in the 1800s, are important food fish outside North America.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Woodstock (song),"Although Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young had learned the song from Joni Mitchell herself, the band's version slightly rearranged the lyrics from her original. They put the line, ""we are billion year old carbon"" — which only appeared in her final chorus — into each of the first three choruses. Then they replaced that line with ""we are caught in the devil's bargain"" in the last chorus, which was also in Mitchell's final chorus.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Telautograph,"The telautograph's invention is attributed to Elisha Gray, who patented it on July 31, 1888. Gray's patent stated that the telautograph would allow ""one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit."" It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars.

Colosseum,"The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Arecaceae,"However, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo.
