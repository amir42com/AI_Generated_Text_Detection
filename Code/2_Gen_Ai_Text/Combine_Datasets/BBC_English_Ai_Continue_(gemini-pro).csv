"'Prison was holiday camp compared to forced labour', court hears","Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and Lee Carbis, 34, deny several offences. They allegedly kept Michael Hughes, 46, and another man, 41, in ""appalling conditions"" at an industrial unit in Goole, East Yorkshire. Leeds Crown Court heard how Mr Hughes was allegedly ""routinely beaten"", forced to work 16-hour days, given only scraps of food and was doused in freezing cold water. In a video interview played to the jury, Mr Hughes said he had to sleep on a ""filthy"" piece of cardboard in a container. He claimed he was so hungry that he ate raw fish out of a bin, and at one point begged his captors to kill him, saying: ""I can't do this, I can't take it any more."" The court heard how Mr Hughes managed to escape and raise the alarm after 12 months of captivity. The jury was also shown a video of the other alleged victim, who was so malnourished and weak that he was only able to crawl on his hands and knees. Prosecutor Robert Smith QC said the defendants had treated their victims ""like animals"" and had ""exploited their vulnerability"". The defendants claim the two men were willing participants in a legitimate ""work placement"" scheme. Patrick Joseph Connors told the jury that Mr Hughes was ""free to come and go as he pleased"" and that he had never been assaulted. He said he had allowed Mr Hughes to sleep in the container because he had nowhere else to go. Patrick Dean Connors claimed that the other alleged victim had been ""lazy"" and had refused to work. He said he had given the man food and money and had even offered to help him find accommodation. The trial continues.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Delhi rape: PM promises to pursue panel recommendations,"Manmohan Singh wrote to the panel's head, ex-chief justice JS Verma, saying the report would be taken up promptly. The commission called for faster trials and longer sentences for convicted rapists, but not the death penalty. The brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December has sparked outrage in India and around the world. The case has reignited a debate about the safety of women in India and the need for tougher laws against sexual violence. The Verma Commission was set up in response to the public outcry over the Delhi rape case. The commission was tasked with examining the issue of sexual violence in India and making recommendations on how to prevent and respond to such crimes. The commission's report, which was released on 23 January, made a number of recommendations, including: Faster trials for rape cases Longer sentences for convicted rapists The establishment of special courts to deal with sexual violence cases The creation of a national registry of sexual offenders The provision of free legal aid to victims of sexual violence The government has welcomed the commission's report and has pledged to implement its recommendations. However, some activists have expressed concern that the government will not take sufficient action to address the issue of sexual violence in India. The Verma Commission's report is a significant step towards addressing the issue of sexual violence in India. However, it is important to remember that the report is only a first step. The government must now take action to implement the commission's recommendations. Only then will India be able to make progress towards becoming a safer place for women. In addition to the Verma Commission's recommendations, there are a number of other things that can be done to address the issue of sexual violence in India. These include: Education: It is important to educate people about sexual violence, including what it is, how to prevent it, and how to respond to it. Awareness: It is also important to raise awareness about the issue of sexual violence. This can be done through public service announcements, media campaigns, and social media. Support: Victims of sexual violence need support and assistance. This can include medical care, counseling, and legal aid. Prevention: It is also important to work to prevent sexual violence from happening in the first place. This can be done by creating safe environments, empowering women, and holding perpetrators accountable. By working together, we can create a safer future for women in India.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Bath and Bristol streets exceed EU pollution levels,"Data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Council showed nitrogen dioxide levels were more than twice the EU limit in some roads. Bristol City Council said reducing the amount of traffic to just essential journeys was one of many ways to improve air quality. ""We are legally required to meet EU limits on air quality, and we have a number of measures in place to help us do this,"" a spokesperson said. ""These include encouraging people to use public transport, walk or cycle instead of driving, and working with businesses to reduce their emissions."" Bath and North East Somerset Council said it was working on a number of initiatives to tackle air pollution, including promoting electric vehicles and installing electric vehicle charging points. ""We are also working with local schools and businesses to encourage them to reduce their emissions,"" a spokesperson said. ""We recognize that air pollution is a serious issue, and we are committed to doing everything we can to improve air quality in Bath and North East Somerset."" Air pollution is a major public health issue, and it is estimated to cause around 40,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant that is particularly harmful to respiratory health, and it can cause a range of problems, including asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. The EU has set a limit for nitrogen dioxide of 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m³). However, data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Council showed that nitrogen dioxide levels were more than twice this limit in some roads. For example, on the A4 in Bath, nitrogen dioxide levels were as high as 88 µg/m³, and on the M32 in Bristol, levels were as high as 82 µg/m³. These high levels of air pollution are a serious concern, and it is clear that more needs to be done to improve air quality in Bath and Bristol. One way to reduce air pollution is to reduce the amount of traffic on the roads. This can be done by encouraging people to use public transport, walk, or cycle instead of driving. Another way to reduce air pollution is to promote electric vehicles. Electric vehicles do not produce any emissions, so they are much better for air quality than petrol or diesel vehicles. Bath and Bristol councils are both working on a number of initiatives to tackle air pollution, but more needs to be done. The government needs to provide more funding for local councils to invest in public transport and electric vehicle charging points.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

London 2012: India 'to raise role of Dow Chemical',"The sports ministry told the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to convey its concerns, saying there was ""strong public sentiment"" on the issue. Dow has links to the firm behind the Bhopal disaster in 1984, which killed thousands of people. The IOA said it would meet Dow officials to discuss the issue. ""We will meet Dow officials and take up the matter with them,"" IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta told the BBC. ""We will convey the government's concerns and see what they have to say."" The Bhopal disaster was one of the world's worst industrial accidents. A leak of methyl isocyanate gas from a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, central India, killed more than 3,000 people and injured hundreds of thousands more. Dow acquired Union Carbide in 2001. The Indian government has been pressuring Dow to pay compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. In 2010, the Indian Supreme Court ordered Dow to pay $2 billion in compensation to the victims. Dow has appealed against the ruling. The controversy over Dow's sponsorship of the London Olympics has put the Indian government in a difficult position. On the one hand, the government wants to support its athletes at the Olympics. On the other hand, it is under pressure from the public to take a stand against Dow. The IOA is now in the unenviable position of having to balance these competing interests. The IOA has said that it is committed to ensuring that the Indian team is able to compete at the Olympics. ""We want to ensure that our athletes are able to participate in the Olympics without any distractions,"" Mehta said. ""We will do everything we can to make sure that happens."" The IOA is also aware of the public sentiment on the issue. ""We are aware of the public sentiment on this issue,"" Mehta said. ""We will take that into account when we meet with Dow officials.""

Three teenagers arrive in Fiji after Pacific ordeal,"The boys, from the Tokelau Islands, a New Zealand-administered territory in the South Pacific, had been given up for dead. They had set off in a small boat on September 5 to go fishing but failed to return. An extensive search by the New Zealand Air Force and other agencies was called off after four days. However, on September 15, the boys were spotted by a passing fishing boat about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from their home island. They were taken to the Fijian island of Ono-i-Lau, where they were given medical attention. The boys, aged 15, 14, and 13, told rescuers that they had survived by eating fish and drinking rainwater. They said they had also used a sail to catch rainwater. The boys' families were overjoyed to learn that they were alive. They said they had never given up hope that their sons would be found. The boys' survival is a testament to their resilience and determination. It is also a reminder of the dangers that people face when they venture out into the open ocean. The Tokelau Islands are a group of three atolls located in the South Pacific Ocean. The islands are home to about 1,500 people. The islands are a New Zealand-administered territory. The boys' ordeal began when they set off in a small boat on September 5 to go fishing. They were planning to fish for a few hours and then return home. However, the weather conditions worsened, and the boys lost their way. The boys drifted for days, with no food or water. They eventually spotted a passing fishing boat and were rescued.

Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift,"Larry Fink, who runs BlackRock, said the shift will happen ""sooner than most anticipate"". His company has announced ""sustainable"" versions of its products and pledged that ""climate change"" would be a core investment conviction. ""We are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,"" Fink wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. ""The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance."" The value of assets that explicitly target environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors doubled to $40 trillion last year, according to investment research firm Morningstar. So far, much of the investment has been in equity markets, with a focus on renewable energy stocks. But Fink believes this is just the start. ""We are entering a 'new era of investing',"" he said. ""The next 1,000 unicorns won't be search engines or social media companies, they'll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonize and create a more sustainable future."" Fink's comments come as the world grapples with the escalating climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, the world will need to invest trillions of dollars in clean energy, energy efficiency, and other climate-friendly technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy sector will need to invest around $5 trillion per year over the next decade to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The shift towards sustainable investing is being driven by a number of factors, including growing awareness of the climate crisis, regulatory changes, and changing consumer preferences. Investors are increasingly realizing that climate change poses a major financial risk. According to the Bank of England, climate change could cause global GDP to decline by up to 10% by 2050. Governments are also introducing new regulations to encourage sustainable investing. In the UK, the government has introduced a new requirement for large pension funds to report on their climate-related risks and opportunities. Consumers are also increasingly demanding products and services from companies that are committed to sustainability. According to a recent survey by Nielsen, 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from sustainable brands. The shift towards sustainable investing is a major challenge, but it is also a major opportunity. By investing in companies that are helping to solve the climate crisis, investors can generate long-term financial returns and help to create a more sustainable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Teenagers risk missing out on savings pots,"By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter These funds were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government of £250, which was doubled for the most disadvantaged families, and additional payments can also be made by parents and family members. Now known as Child Trust Funds (CTFs), they were initially very popular. In its first 12 months of operation almost one million CTFs were opened, and 13 years on around 6.3 million CTFs have been opened across the UK.  However, campaigners say that take-up started to decline following the introduction of a lower contribution rate, set at £50, by the Conservative government in 2011. There are also concerns that parents are not saving into them as much as they could. The average total amount saved in a CTF is just under £1,000 - well below the £1,865 total maximum government contribution. Last year, the Post Office found that 43% of the Child Trust Funds it looks after still only had the original £250 government contribution and there was no additional money added.  A further 22% had less than £500 in total. The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) is concerned that this means rising numbers of young people could be missing out on a substantial financial boost when they reach 18, the age at which they gain access to their CTF. ""The potential long-term loss is significant,"" says CIFF. ""If a typical child was to start saving £6 a week into their CTF, by the time they were 18 they could have accumulated £6,500, assuming a 3% average return. ""Even if they saved just £1 a week they could still end up with £1,300 at 18."" Some banks and building societies have also questioned the future of the CTF, with several stopping offering the product in recent years. Campaigners say the government needs to improve awareness of CTFs, and encourage more families to save into them and a number of banks have urged ministers to simplify the Child Trust Fund system to make it more accessible for poor families. Last year the government announced it was investing £2.5bn in CTFs over the next decade, enabling automatic contributions to increase from £250 to £500 for some children, but CIFF says this is not enough. ""We'd like to see the government ringfence CTFs so that they are not used to pay for other savings products or benefits,"" says CIFF. ""We also want to see the addition of a universal contribution, of say £50 a year, regardless of a family's income or savings history."" The government says it is keeping CTFs under review and will ""continue to make sure that all children, regardless of their background, have the best start in life"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM,"Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM _By Justin Rowlatt_ _Chief environment correspondent_ The prime minister will tell a meeting hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that climate action cannot be allowed to become another victim of the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson, who co-chairs the event with Mr Guterres, will say that ""climate and Covid are two sides of the same coin"", and that they both threaten both our health and prosperity. He will argue that the pandemic has shown that it is possible to take collective action to tackle a global problem, and that the same approach is now needed to tackle the threat of climate change. ""We need to act with the same urgency and ambition that we have brought to the fight against coronavirus,"" he will say. ""Climate change is an even greater threat to humanity than Covid, and it will require an even greater collective effort to overcome it."" The prime minister's speech comes ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is due to be held in Glasgow in November. The conference is seen as a crucial opportunity to accelerate global action on climate change, and to increase the ambition of countries' emissions reduction targets. However, the pandemic has cast doubt over whether the conference will be able to take place as planned, and there are concerns that it could be postponed or even canceled. In his speech, the prime minister will stress the importance of holding the conference as scheduled, and will say that it is ""more important than ever"" to show that the world is committed to tackling climate change. ""COP26 must be a success,"" he will say. ""It is our best chance to put the world on a path to a more sustainable future."" The prime minister's speech will be welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have been calling for the government to show more leadership on climate change. However, they are likely to be disappointed that he did not use his speech to announce any new policies or measures to tackle the climate crisis. The prime minister's speech comes as the UK prepares to host the G7 summit in Cornwall next month. The summit will bring together leaders from the world's seven largest economies, and is expected to focus on a range of issues, including climate change. The prime minister is expected to use the summit to press other countries to increase their ambition on climate change, and to commit to more ambitious emissions reduction targets.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods,"They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed. The Welsh Government said consultation has not yet started, but ""significant change"" could be required to protect marine life. Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods Fishermen in Wales are calling on the Welsh Government to halt plans to restrict the number of pots they can use to catch crabs and lobsters. They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed. The Welsh Government said consultation has not yet started, but ""significant change"" could be required to protect marine life. The proposed changes would see the number of pots a fisherman can use reduced from 200 to 100. Fishermen say this would make it impossible for them to make a living. One fisherman, who asked not to be named, said: ""This is a devastating blow to our industry. We've been fishing these waters for generations and we know what we're doing. ""These restrictions are not based on science. They're just a knee-jerk reaction to what some people wrongly perceive as a problem with crab and lobster stocks."" Another fisherman said: ""We're being treated like criminals. We're not doing anything wrong. We're just trying to make a living."" The Welsh Government said it was committed to working with the fishing industry to find a solution that protects marine life and livelihoods. A spokesperson said: ""We understand the concerns of the fishing industry and we are committed to working with them to find a solution that is fair and sustainable. ""However, we must also take into account the need to protect our marine environment. We believe that significant change is required to achieve this."" The consultation on the proposed changes is expected to start in the autumn. Background The Welsh Government has identified a number of concerns about the sustainability of crab and lobster fishing in Wales. These include: Overfishing: The government believes that the number of crabs and lobsters being caught is not sustainable. Bycatch: The government is concerned about the number of other marine animals, such as dolphins and porpoises, that are being caught in crab and lobster pots. Damage to the marine environment: The government believes that crab and lobster pots can damage the seabed and other marine habitats. The government's proposed changes are designed to address these concerns. The fishing industry has argued that the government's concerns are not supported by the evidence. The industry has also pointed out that crab and lobster fishing is a vital part of the Welsh economy. The industry is worth an estimated £100 million a year and supports around 1,000 jobs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
King Charles III: Outcry 'surprises' Prince William actor Oliver Chris,"BBC Two's King Charles III, which will be shown on Wednesday, imagines events after the death of the Queen. It has ruffled feathers for raising the question of Prince Harry's paternity and showing Princess Anne smoking weed. However, the actor who plays Prince William has said he was surprised by the outcry. Oliver Chris, who has previously starred in shows such as The Crown and Strike, said he was ""taken aback"" by the reaction to the play. ""I thought people would be more interested in the constitutional crisis and the question of who should succeed the Queen,"" he said. Chris said he believes the play is ""a fair and balanced portrayal of the Royal Family."" He said the cast and crew had worked hard to ""represent them accurately and respectfully."" However, some critics have accused the play of being disrespectful and sensationalist. The Daily Mail called it ""a hatchet job on the Royal Family"" and said it was ""full of cruel and unnecessary jibes."" The play has also been criticized for its depiction of Prince Harry. In the play, Harry is portrayed as a troubled young man who is struggling to come to terms with his royal status. He is also shown to be estranged from his family and to have a difficult relationship with his wife, Meghan Markle. Chris said he understands why some people might find the play's portrayal of Harry upsetting. However, he said he believes it is an important and accurate portrayal of a complex character. ""Harry is a young man who is going through a lot of changes in his life,"" Chris said. ""He's trying to find his place in the world and he's struggling to deal with the pressures of being a royal.

Anonymous backs new encrypted social network site,"The site, Minds.com, has the same basic set-up as other social networks. Users post updates to followers, who can comment or share. However, there are a few key differences that set Minds apart. Firstly, Minds is a decentralised platform. This means that it is not controlled by a single entity, such as Facebook or Twitter. Instead, it is run by a network of independent nodes. This makes it much more difficult for governments or corporations to censor or shut down the site. Secondly, Minds is committed to privacy. All user data is encrypted, and the site does not track users' activity. This makes it a much safer place to share sensitive information, such as political opinions or personal data. Finally, Minds is a non-profit organisation. This means that it is not driven by profit, and it can focus on providing a high-quality service to its users. Minds has been praised by privacy advocates and free speech activists. However, it has also been criticised for its lack of moderation. The site has been used by white supremacists and other hate groups to spread their messages. Despite these concerns, Minds is growing in popularity. The site has over 1 million users, and it is adding new users every day. If Minds can continue to grow and improve, it has the potential to become a major player in the social media landscape. In a statement, Anonymous said that it is backing Minds because it believes that the site is ""a step in the right direction for the future of the internet."" ""We need to move away from the centralised, corporate-controlled internet that we have today,"" Anonymous said.

Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June,"The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first £500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July 2020, but was due to revert to £125,000 from April. The government says the move will save home buyers an average of £2,500. The extension will apply retrospectively to anyone who completed the purchase of a property on or after 8 July 2020 and before 1 July 2021. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The stamp duty holiday has helped to keep the property market moving during the pandemic and has supported jobs across the sector. By extending the holiday, we are continuing to help people move, support jobs and stimulate the economy."" The move has been welcomed by the property industry, with the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) saying it would ""provide a further boost to the market"". ""The extension of the stamp duty holiday is a positive step for the property market and will help to maintain momentum,"" said Mark Hayward, chief executive of the NAEA Propertymark. ""It will provide a further boost to the market and help to support jobs in the sector."" However, some experts have warned that the extension could lead to a rise in house prices. ""The stamp duty holiday has been a major factor in the recent surge in house prices,"" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. ""Extending the holiday will only add further fuel to the fire and could lead to even higher prices."" The government has said it will keep the impact of the stamp duty holiday on house prices under review. The extension of the stamp duty holiday is the latest in a series of measures introduced by the government to support the property market during the pandemic.

Southeastern customers face worsening services,"Tom Edwards Transport correspondent, London @BBCTomEdwards on Twitter If you thought your commute was bad now, it will get worse for the next five years. That's the message hidden in the small print of new plans to overhaul Southeastern. The franchise, which runs trains from London through Kent and East Sussex, was taken over by the government in 2021 amid complaints of poor performance. It's now being run by the Department for Transport (DfT), which has said it will pump in millions of pounds to improve the service. But documents seen by the BBC show that despite this investment, passengers can expect a reduction in services compared with before the pandemic. By summer 2024, Southeastern plans to run 92.5% of pre-pandemic services. That will rise to 95% by summer 2025 and 97.5% by summer 2026. It is not until summer 2027 that the full pre-pandemic service will be restored. And that's on the assumption that all goes to plan. The DfT has warned that these targets could be missed if there are any delays in the delivery of new trains, or if strike action continues to disrupt services. Southeastern has been hit hard by industrial action, with RMT union members striking over pay and working conditions. The union says that Southeastern is among the worst-performing train operators in the country. Southeastern has defended its performance, saying that it is running more trains than at any time since the pandemic began. But it is clear that passengers are not happy. In a recent survey by consumer group Which?, Southeastern was rated the worst train operator in the UK. Passengers complained of overcrowding, delays and cancellations. The DfT says it is ""working closely"" with Southeastern to improve performance. But it is clear that passengers will have to be patient. It could be five years before they see a full restoration of pre-pandemic services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
RHI inquiry: Call for review of special adviser role,"The special adviser to the then-Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell who was tasked with managing the botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme is to be recalled to the inquiry examining the project. David Sterling's witness statements to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) inquiry were published on Wednesday. He is due to give evidence again on Thursday. The inquiry has been told that, in 2015, Mr Sterling asked for a cap to be imposed on the scheme - but was told by Mr Bell to ""do nothing"". The inquiry is investigating the running and collapse of the RHI scheme, which left Stormont with an estimated £490m overspend. It is examining whether there was any cover-up or obstruction of justice. Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin has written to Mr Bell asking him to provide a fuller explanation of his account of a key meeting in March 2015. Sinn Féin's Máirtín Ó Muilleoir described the inquiry's latest findings as ""a bombshell"". ""The evidence suggests that the special adviser, Mr Sterling, raised concerns about how much the RHI scheme was going to cost against the budget and was told to do nothing,"" the North Antrim MLA said. ""It is more proof that this was a scheme that was doomed to fail from the get-go."" In a statement to the inquiry, Mr Sterling said that, during the meeting in March 2015, he had asked Mr Bell whether there should be a cap on the amount of money available to the RHI scheme. He said that Mr Bell had responded: ""I need you to do nothing."" Mr Sterling said that the department's permanent secretary Andrew McCormick had then intervened and told Mr Bell that he should reconsider his position. Mr Sterling said that Mr Bell had then said: ""OK, I will reconsider this over the weekend."" However, in his witness statement to the inquiry, Mr Bell said that he had not understood Mr Sterling to be making a request for a cap. He said that he had thought Mr Sterling was asking for guidance on how to respond to a question from the media about whether there could be a cap. Mr Bell said that he had not told Mr Sterling to do nothing. ""I fully understood the importance of having regard to public expenditure,"" he said. ""I am not so foolish as to just say, 'Do nothing'. ""I would never have said that because I understood the constraints on public expenditure."" Sir Patrick wrote to Mr Bell, saying that his account of the meeting ""lacks any semblance of credibility"". ""Your evidence about not understanding Mr Sterling to be making a request for a cap raises even more serious issues about your honesty and reliability as a witness,"" he wrote. ""You must appreciate that the inquiry expects witnesses to give a full, frank and truthful account of the events in question."" Sir Patrick said that he believed that Mr Sterling's account of the meeting was ""more likely to be the truth"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Video 'shows hunt law breached',"By David Miller BBC Scotland environment correspondent Campaigners claim the ban on hunting with dogs is routinely being flouted. Hunt supporters insist they take great care to respect the law. Footage obtained by the League Against Cruel Sports appears to show foxes being chased and killed by hounds in the Borders, Scotland. The Scottish government said it takes allegations of illegal hunting ""very seriously"" and is ""committed to ensuring compliance"" with the law. The Hunting Act 2004 banned the hunting of wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales, and the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 had a similar effect north of the border, although some exemptions were made for pest control, game bird management and hunting deer. The Scottish government's guidance states that hounds must be under ""close control"" at all times and landowners must make ""all reasonable endeavours to prevent the dogs from pursuing or killing a wild mammal"", while the game bird exemption only applies during the legal season for game birds. However, campaigners from the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) say they have documented examples of hunts flouting these rules in the past year. A spokesman said: ""Our investigations have exposed numerous serious incidents of illegal fox hunting and deer hunting. ""The evidence we have gathered includes foxes being chased and killed by hounds after a hunt saboteur witnessed the dogs being released and also deer being chased down a public road in full view of members of the public."" LACS is calling on the Scottish government to take ""urgent action"" to tackle the problem, including increasing penalties for those caught breaking the law and providing more support for enforcement officers. However, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said it was ""confident that the vast majority of shooting estates in Scotland are operating within the law"". A spokesman said: ""SGA members take their legal responsibilities very seriously and are committed to operating within the letter and spirit of the law. ""We do not condone any form of illegal hunting and we urge anyone with evidence of such activity to report it to the relevant authorities."" The Scottish government said it was ""aware of the concerns raised by the LACS"" and was ""working closely with Police Scotland to investigate any allegations of illegal hunting"". A spokesman said: ""We take allegations of illegal hunting very seriously and are committed to ensuring compliance with the law. ""We are also working with stakeholders to improve understanding of the law and to encourage responsible behavior.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Theresa May 'not considering election' on walking break, says No 10","But - stand down everyone - Number 10 has insisted the prime minister is not considering calling a general election. Mrs May famously decided to call a snap election in 2017, with her Conservative Party losing their majority in the House of Commons. Her spokesman told reporters: ""The prime minister is not considering calling a general election."" The denial comes as the prime minister takes a break in the Swiss Alps with her husband, Philip. The couple are staying in a luxury chalet in the mountain resort of Klosters, where they have been pictured walking in the snow. The prime minister's decision to go on holiday has been criticised by some, who say she should be focusing on Brexit negotiations. But her spokesman said: ""The prime minister is entitled to take a break. She has been working hard over the past few months, and she needs some time to rest and recharge."" It is not clear how long the prime minister will be on holiday for, but she is expected to return to work next week. Her decision to rule out a general election will come as a relief to many Conservative MPs. Many Tory MPs fear that a general election would result in the party losing even more seats, and potentially even handing power to the Labour Party. A general election is not due until 2022, but there has been speculation that the prime minister could call one earlier if she is able to secure a good deal on Brexit. However, with the Brexit negotiations still ongoing, it is not clear when or if such a deal will be reached. Meanwhile, the prime minister's decision to rule out a general election has been welcomed by the Labour Party. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Theresa May's decision not to call a general election shows that she is running scared of the people. ""She knows that if she called an election, she would lose. The people have lost confidence in her and her government."" The Liberal Democrats have also welcomed the prime minister's decision. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Theresa May is right to rule out a general election. The country needs stability, not more chaos. ""We need to focus on getting a good deal on Brexit, and on building a fairer and more prosperous society.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Endangered species: Gunshot detection technology deployed,"By Cristina Criddle, Technology reporter  New technology has been developed by international conservation charity the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Google Cloud. The technology detects gunshots in real time, through machine learning algorithms. It uses audio recordings from smartphones left in the field by rangers, scientists, and community patrollers. When a gunshot is detected, the system immediately sends an alert to the user's phone, enabling a rapid response to poaching incidents. The system was developed using a dataset of over 100,000 gunshot and non-gunshot audio recordings, collected by ZSL and the University of Oxford's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. The system also includes a web interface that allows users to view gunshot detections on a map, manage their devices, and access information on poaching incidents. The technology has been deployed in several countries, including Nepal, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Nepal, the system has been used to detect poaching incidents in Chitwan National Park, home to the world's largest population of one-horned rhinos. In Gabon, the system has been used to monitor poaching in Loango National Park, home to a diverse range of endangered species, including elephants, gorillas, and chimpanzees. The technology is part of ZSL's EDGE of Existence programme, which focuses on protecting threatened and endangered species. Dr. Amy Hinsley, ZSL's EDGE of Existence programme manager, said: ""We are excited about the potential of this technology to help us protect endangered species from poaching. The system can detect gunshots in real time, enabling rangers to respond quickly and effectively to poaching incidents."" Dr. David Maxwell, Google Cloud's director of product management for artificial intelligence, said: ""We are proud to partner with ZSL on this important project. Our machine learning expertise and cloud computing platform have enabled us to develop a system that can detect gunshots in real time, providing rangers with the tools they need to protect endangered species."" The deployment of this technology is a significant step forward in the fight against poaching. It provides rangers and conservationists with a powerful tool to detect and deter poaching incidents, helping to protect the world's most endangered species.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: Paris restrictions to stay as France reopens,"Edouard Philippe said the country was ""cut in two"" in terms of the rate of infections. Restrictions will remain in the capital and north-eastern regions. It comes as France prepares to relax its nationwide lockdown on 11 May. Mr Philippe told the French parliament that there remained ""territorial disparities"" in the battle against the virus. ""In some territories, the virus is practically under control and in others it's still circulating very actively,"" he said. He said that restrictions in the Paris region would stay in place for now, along with several other regions including Grand Est, Mayotte, Ile-de-France, and Burgundy-Franche-Comte. However, local authorities will be given more freedom to relax some measures if they wish. From 11 May, the rest of France will be able to start easing restrictions, such as reopening shops that are less than 400 sq m, and allowing people to travel within 100km of their home. Parks are to reopen and people will be allowed to exercise without a time limit, but beaches will remain shut. Bars, restaurants, museums and cinemas will stay closed, but libraries will reopen. People will not be obliged to have special permission to go out, as is currently the case, but they will still need to fill out a form giving a reason for their movements. The prime minister said he understood that Parisians would be disappointed, but he said there was ""no choice"". ""We couldn't take the risk of having a new outbreak of the epidemic after 11 May,"" he said. ""That would be a disaster."" The decision comes after a slow but steady reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases in France. On Saturday, 19 May, there were 104 new deaths, the lowest daily toll since 20 March.

""We've got a strong balance sheet now and a strong capital position, so we're not considering closing it. ""We're also committed to Northern Ireland and committed to supporting our customers and our colleagues in Northern Ireland.""

The bank's financial performance had improved in 2018, with a reported operating profit of £384m, but that still lagged behind most of the group's other operations.

Pakistan Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah targeted by US strike in Afghanistan,"Fazlullah's men shot the schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan in 2012. He was also behind the 2014 massacre in the Pakistani city of Peshawar that killed more than 130 schoolchildren. He became the TTP's leader after his predecessor Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in 2013. Fazlullah was born in 1974 in the Swat Valley in northwestern Pakistan. He received religious training in a madrassa, a religious school, and became known for his fiery speeches against the Pakistani government. He joined the TTP in 2007 and quickly rose through the ranks. Under Fazlullah's leadership, the TTP became increasingly violent. The group carried out a number of suicide bombings and assassinations, and it also imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law in the areas it controlled. Fazlullah was also accused of ordering the beheading of 23 Pakistani soldiers in 2012. In 2014, the Pakistani military launched an operation to clear the TTP from the Swat Valley. The operation was largely successful, and Fazlullah was forced to flee to Afghanistan. He continued to lead the TTP from exile, but his influence has diminished in recent years. Fazlullah was targeted by a US drone strike in Afghanistan on June 13, 2018. The strike killed Fazlullah and several other TTP members. The US government said that Fazlullah was a ""terrorist leader"" and that his death ""will disrupt the TTP's ability to plan and carry out attacks against innocent civilians."" The Pakistani government welcomed the news of Fazlullah's death. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that Fazlullah was ""a brutal terrorist"" who ""had caused immense pain and suffering to the people of Pakistan."" The TTP has not yet named a successor to Fazlullah. The group is likely to face a period of instability following his death, but it is too early to say whether this will lead to a decline in violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New Aberdeen FC stadium could be derailed even if approved,"The stadium and training facilities would be at Kingsford, near Westhill. Although the final decision is a matter for Aberdeen councillors, Aberdeenshire Council will have to agree to a controlled parking zone. The zone would mean drivers would have to pay to park near the stadium on match days, with the money raised going towards transport infrastructure in the area. However, Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee voted against the plans at a meeting on Thursday. They argued that the council should not be responsible for funding transport infrastructure for a private development. The committee's decision does not mean the plans for the new stadium are dead. However, it does mean that Aberdeen FC will have to find another way to fund the transport infrastructure. One option would be for the club to pay for it themselves. However, this would likely be a significant cost. Another option would be for Aberdeen FC to work with the Scottish government or other partners to find funding. However, this could also be a lengthy and difficult process. The decision by Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee is a setback for Aberdeen FC's plans for a new stadium. However, it is not necessarily the end of the road. The club will now have to explore other options for funding the transport infrastructure. If they can find a way to do this, the new stadium could still be built. In a statement, Aberdeen FC said they were ""disappointed"" by the committee's decision. ""We believe that the proposed new stadium would be a major asset for the north-east of Scotland,"" the club said. ""We will now consider our options and continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to try to find a way forward.""

Canada's immigration website crashes during US vote,"Officials have confirmed that the cause was a higher than normal level of traffic. It has been suggested this may have been related to the US vote, as many Americans were reportedly looking into the possibility of emigrating to Canada. The website has since been restored, but the incident has raised questions about Canada's immigration system. Some critics have argued that the system is not equipped to handle the increasing number of people who are looking to come to Canada. In recent years, Canada has seen a significant increase in the number of people who are applying for permanent residency. In 2019, over 340,000 people applied for permanent residency, up from 250,000 in 2015. The increase in applications has been attributed to a number of factors, including the country's strong economy, its high quality of life, and its welcoming immigration policies. However, the influx of applications has also put a strain on the immigration system. The government has taken steps to address the issue, including increasing the number of staff who process applications and investing in new technology. However, the website crash suggests that more needs to be done. Some experts have called for the government to adopt a more streamlined application process. Others have suggested that the government should increase the number of visas that are available to skilled workers. The government has said that it is committed to making the immigration system more efficient and responsive. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the challenges that the system is facing. The website crash is a reminder of the challenges that Canada faces as it tries to manage the increasing number of people who are looking to come to the country.

Grave of 'George III's granddaughter' restored in Carmarthen,"Experts say Caroline Prytherch and her sister were related to the former king due to his links with Hannah Lightfoot during his time as Prince of Wales. The previously lost family grave of Ms Prytherch at St David's Church, Carmarthen, has been restored. Local historian Robert Evans, who has been researching the family history for more than 10 years, said the two sisters were related to King George III through an illegitimate son born to his brother, Prince William Henry. ""Hannah Lightfoot was his mistress, but she was not accepted at court. She was pregnant at the time, and the child was taken away from her,"" Mr Evans explained. The child, William, was brought up by the Prytherch sisters' grandmother in Carmarthen. ""This was considered a left-handed marriage at the time and there is some evidence to suggest that it was accepted,"" he added. The sisters' mother, Lettice Thomas, was a relation of the Prytherch sisters' grandmother, so the link to the royal family goes through both sides. Mr Evans said that the two sisters lived in Carmarthen all their lives and were well-respected members of the community. ""They were known for their kindness and generosity, and they were always willing to help those in need,"" he added. The sisters never married, and they died within a few months of each other in 1872. They were buried in the churchyard at St David's Church. Over time, their grave became overgrown and neglected. However, thanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, it has now been restored. The grave has been cleaned and repaired, and a new headstone has been erected. The headstone bears the sisters' names and dates of death, as well as the inscription: ""Descendants of William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George III"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Solar subsidy 'to be protected',"By Bob Howard Reporter, Money Box The feed-in tariff scheme was launched last April. It promised a typical household earnings of £800 a year for generating electricity from renewable sources such as solar panels, or small wind turbines. But there are fears that the scheme could be scaled back, or even scrapped, as part of the government's spending review. Solar power advocates have condemned the proposal, saying it would damage the UK's nascent solar industry. The Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Chris Huhne, has said that no decisions have been made, but he has admitted that the feed-in tariff scheme is ""expensive"". The government has already announced that it will cut spending on other renewable energy schemes, such as the Renewables Obligation. This has led to fears that the government is not committed to supporting renewable energy. However, the government has said that it remains committed to meeting its targets for renewable energy. The UK has a target of generating 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. The feed-in tariff scheme is one of the key policies that the government is using to meet this target. The scheme has been successful in encouraging people to install solar panels. In the first year of the scheme, over 100,000 solar panels were installed. This is more than double the number that were installed in the previous year. However, the solar industry is still in its early stages. The cost of solar panels has fallen in recent years, but they are still more expensive than traditional forms of electricity generation. The feed-in tariff scheme helps to make solar power more affordable. But if the scheme is scaled back, or scrapped, it could make it more difficult for the solar industry to grow. The government is due to announce its decision on the future of the feed-in tariff scheme in the autumn.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Another, surnamed Wang, queried: ""Is this question relevant to the syllabus?"" Other users said they felt sorry for the children who were left flummoxed by the question. One user said: ""This is just to torture the kids."" Another added: ""The person who came up with this question needs to go back to school."" The question has since been removed from the paper and an investigation has been launched into how it came to be included in the first place. In a statement, the Shunqing District Education Bureau said: ""We have taken this matter very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation. We will take appropriate action once the investigation is complete."" The incident has sparked a debate about the quality of education in China. Some parents have called for stricter controls on the content of exams, while others have said that schools need to focus more on developing students' critical thinking skills. One expert, Professor Zhang Minxuan of Beijing Normal University, said: ""This question is a typical example of the kind of rote learning that is still prevalent in Chinese schools. Students are expected to memorize facts and figures, rather than to think for themselves."" He added: ""We need to move away from this kind of teaching and learning and focus more on developing students' critical thinking skills. This means teaching them how to analyse information, solve problems, and make decisions."" The Shunqing District Education Bureau has said that it will take steps to improve the quality of education in the district. It has also said that it will provide more support to teachers and parents. The incident has also prompted calls for a national review of exam content. One member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a top advisory body, has called for a ""thorough review"" of all school exams. He said: ""We need to make sure that exams are testing students' knowledge and skills, not just their ability to memorize facts."" The debate about the quality of education in China is likely to continue. However, the Shunqing District Education Bureau has said that it is committed to improving the quality of education in the district and is taking steps to address the concerns of parents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"New markets for Welsh firms after Brexit, says PM","The Conservative leader said she wanted the ""best possible deal"" for Wales and the whole of the UK. Meanwhile, Mrs May confirmed that she had written to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, formally beginning the process of exiting the EU. ""The Government will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people and will bring certainty and clarity to the UK's future outside the EU,"" she said. ""We want to build an economy that works for everyone, where young people have the chance to succeed and where public services can be protected."" The UK will now enter a two-year period of negotiations with the EU, during which time it will need to secure a deal on the terms of its exit, including trade, immigration and security. The government has said that it wants to achieve a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU, but it is unclear what this will entail. Businesses and organisations in Wales have welcomed the prospect of new markets outside the EU, but have also expressed concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy. The Welsh government has said that it will work to ensure that Wales benefits from the opportunities that Brexit presents. ""We will work with the UK government to secure the best possible deal for Wales,"" said First Minister Carwyn Jones. ""We will also work to ensure that Wales is well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit presents."" The UK's decision to leave the EU has been met with mixed reactions in Wales. Some people believe that it will be a positive move that will allow the UK to regain control of its borders and laws. Others are concerned about the potential economic impact of Brexit and the loss of access to the single market. The UK government has said that it will work to ensure that the UK leaves the EU in a orderly and stable manner. It has also said that it will work to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The UK's exit from the EU is a complex and challenging process. It is unclear what the final outcome will be, but it is likely to have a significant impact on Wales and the rest of the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
South Africa parliament chaos as Malema MPs heckle Zuma,"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, repeatedly interrupted Mr Zuma, demanding answers over a spending scandal. The speaker of parliament, Baleka Mbete, repeatedly warned the EFF MPs but they continued to heckle the president. At one point, Mr Zuma was forced to stop speaking as the EFF MPs chanted ""Zuma must go!"" and ""Pay back the money!"" Some of the EFF MPs even held up signs that read ""Zuma thief"" and ""Zuma must fall."" The chaos in parliament continued for several minutes before the speaker was forced to adjourn the session. The EFF MPs then marched out of the chamber, chanting slogans and waving their fists. The spending scandal that the EFF MPs were referring to relates to the use of taxpayers' money to upgrade Mr Zuma's private home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal. The Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, found that Mr Zuma had benefited unduly from the upgrades, which cost the state more than 200 million rand ($15 million). Mr Zuma has denied any wrongdoing, but the scandal has damaged his reputation and led to calls for his resignation. The EFF has been one of the most vocal critics of Mr Zuma and has repeatedly called for him to step down. The chaos in parliament is the latest in a series of incidents that have highlighted the growing tensions between the ANC and the EFF. The EFF is a relatively new party, but it has quickly become one of the most popular opposition parties in South Africa. The EFF is known for its radical policies and its confrontational style of politics. The ANC has accused the EFF of being disruptive and disrespectful, but the EFF has defended its tactics, saying that they are necessary to hold the government to account. The chaos in parliament is likely to further strain relations between the two parties. It is unclear what the long-term consequences of the chaos in parliament will be. However, it is clear that the incident has damaged the reputation of both the ANC and the EFF. It is also clear that the tensions between the two parties are likely to continue to grow in the coming months and years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stolen dogs: Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry raids 'uncover 80',"The dogs and puppies are said to be worth tens of thousands of pounds, Dyfed-Powys and South Wales (SWP) police forces said. Pet owners have been warned to be vigilant after two raids in Wales uncovered 80 stolen dogs and puppies. The animals were taken from Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry, near Neath. Officers said they were alerted to the thefts by a concerned member of the public who reported seeing suspicious activity. A team of officers was assembled and raided two addresses, one in Carmarthenshire and the other in Briton Ferry. Inside, they discovered 80 dogs and puppies of various breeds, including French bulldogs, pugs, and German shepherds. The animals were found crammed into small cages and pens, and many were in poor health. Some of the dogs had been microchipped, but many had not. Police said the dogs were stolen to order and were believed to be worth tens of thousands of pounds. ""These animals are often sold for large sums of money, and the trade in stolen dogs is a lucrative one,"" said a spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys Police. ""We are urging pet owners to be vigilant and to take steps to ensure their animals are safe."" Police are asking anyone who has had a dog stolen to contact them. They are also appealing for information about anyone who may have been involved in the thefts. ""We are determined to bring those responsible to justice and to return these animals to their rightful owners,"" the spokesperson said. The raids are part of an ongoing investigation into the theft of dogs in Wales. In recent months, there have been a number of reports of dogs being stolen from homes and gardens. Police believe the thefts are being carried out by organized gangs who are targeting specific breeds of dogs. Pet owners are advised to take the following steps to protect their dogs from being stolen: - Keep your dog on a lead when in public places. - Don't leave your dog unattended in a car or in the garden. - Ensure your dog is microchipped and that the details are up to date. - Report any suspicious activity to the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Government automatically enrols firms in case of no-deal Brexit,"The move will enable UK firms to continue to trade with EU member states after the UK leaves the EU. The government has said it will automatically enrol firms in the scheme if they do not do so themselves. The announcement was made by Brexit Secretary David Davis, who said it was ""essential"" that businesses were prepared for a no-deal Brexit. ""We want to do everything we can to support businesses and ensure that they have the tools and information they need to continue trading with the EU,"" he said. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave."" The scheme will be open to all UK businesses, regardless of size or sector. Businesses will need to provide some basic information about their business, such as their name, address and contact details. They will also need to declare whether they export to the EU or import from the EU. Businesses that are already registered for the scheme will not need to do anything further. The government has said it will provide further details about the scheme in due course. The announcement has been welcomed by businesses. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was ""essential"" that businesses were given support to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave,"" said BCC Director General Adam Marshall. ""We urge all businesses to take advantage of this scheme and to start preparing for a no-deal Brexit."" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) also welcomed the announcement. ""This scheme will help businesses to get the support they need to trade seamlessly with the EU after we leave,"" said CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn. ""We urge all businesses to take advantage of this scheme and to start preparing for a no-deal Brexit.""

Mosul Iraq battle: IS accused of shooting civilians,"The UN says 12 civilians were shot dead on 11 November when they tried to stop militants launching rockets from the roofs of the homes in the Bakir area. Militants allegedly killed 27 others suspected of collaborating with Iraqi forces. The latest allegations of atrocities add to the mounting evidence of the brutality of IS's three-year reign over Mosul. The group's crimes have included mass executions, public torture and rape. Human Rights Watch has accused it of committing ""war crimes, crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide"" in Iraq. Mosul's civilian population has borne the brunt of the fighting. The UN estimates that at least 1,000 civilians have been killed and 10,000 injured since the offensive began in October. The Iraqi government and its US-led coalition partners have been accused of causing civilian casualties with airstrikes and shelling. However, IS has also been blamed for using civilians as human shields and booby-trapping buildings. The humanitarian situation in Mosul is dire. The city's water and electricity supplies are limited and food is scarce. Thousands of people have been displaced from their homes. The UN's humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Lise Grande, has called for safe passage for civilians who want to leave Mosul. She said the UN and its partners were ""ready to scale up our response and provide life-saving assistance to all those in need"". The Iraqi government has said it is committed to minimizing civilian casualties in Mosul. However, it has also vowed to defeat IS at all costs. This suggests that the battle for Mosul could continue for some time, and that the civilian population will continue to suffer. The liberation of Mosul would be a major victory for the Iraqi government and its US-led coalition partners. However, it would also be a Pyrrhic victory if it came at the cost of thousands of civilian lives. The international community must do everything it can to ensure that the civilians of Mosul are protected. The UN must continue to provide humanitarian assistance, and the Iraqi government and its coalition partners must do everything they can to minimize civilian casualties.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Male employees want flexible work too,"By Mary-Ann Russon Business Reporter, BBC News In the past, pressure for the opportunity to work part-time or flexibly has usually come from women. But increasingly, men also want to strike a better work-life balance. For years, the UK government and many individual employers have been encouraging more women into the workplace. Policies such as shared parental leave and flexible working were designed to make it easier for women to return to their jobs after having children. However, as flexible working becomes increasingly common, men are beginning to take advantage of these opportunities too. A recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the number of men working flexibly in the UK has increased by 50% in the past decade. The study also found that flexible working is associated with a range of positive outcomes for both men and women, including: Increased job satisfaction Improved work-life balance Reduced stress levels Increased productivity There are a number of reasons why men are increasingly interested in flexible working. One reason is that men are increasingly taking on more childcare responsibilities. In the past, childcare was often seen as a woman's responsibility, but that is changing. Nowadays, many men are happy to share the childcare with their partners. Another reason why men are interested in flexible working is that they want to spend more time with their families. In the past, men were often expected to work long hours and put their careers first. However, that is no longer the case. Many men now want to have a more balanced life, where they can spend time with their families as well as their work. The rise of flexible working is good news for both men and women. It allows people to work in a way that suits them, and it can help to create a more balanced and fulfilling life. However, there are still some challenges to overcome. One challenge is that flexible working is not always seen as acceptable for men. Some people still believe that men should be the main breadwinners and that they should not be taking time off work to care for their families. Another challenge is that flexible working can be difficult to implement in some workplaces. For example, it can be difficult to arrange flexible working for employees who work in customer-facing roles. Despite these challenges, the trend towards flexible working is likely to continue. As more and more people realize the benefits of flexible working, it will become increasingly accepted and implemented in workplaces.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

£5.6m Newbridge Memo makeover gets under way,"Scaffolding is set to go up at the Grade II listed Newbridge Memorial Hall, known as the Memo, in Caerphilly county. It follows an eight-year fundraising campaign by the hall's trustees. Built in 1923 to commemorate the fallen of the First World War, the Memo has fallen into disrepair in recent years. The £5.6m restoration project will not only ensure the building's future but also revitalise the surrounding area. The makeover includes a new glazed atrium entrance, a lift to provide disabled access, modern toilet facilities, and a new bar and kitchen. A new extension will also be built to house a new community centre, classrooms, meeting rooms, and an office space. The project is being funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Caerphilly County Borough Council, the Welsh government, and the Garfield Weston Foundation. Work is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Once complete, the Memo will once again be a thriving community hub, offering a wide range of activities and events for local people. It will also provide a much-needed space for community groups, businesses, and individuals to meet, socialise, and learn. The Memo's trustees are delighted to see work finally getting under way. ""This is a momentous day for the Memo,"" said chairman John Edmunds. ""We have been working towards this for many years, and we are so grateful to everyone who has supported us. ""The Memo is a vital part of our community, and we are excited to see it restored to its former glory."" The Memo's restoration is part of a wider regeneration project for Newbridge. The village has been awarded £1.5m from the Welsh government's Town Centre Regeneration Fund. The money will be used to improve the village's public realm, including new pavements, streetlighting, and seating. A new community garden will also be created.

Coronavirus funeral restrictions: 'Other families shouldn't have to go through this',"Iolo Cheung BBC News Only 12 people were allowed to attend Bernard Lawrence's funeral last week. His granddaughter Ffion Evans said it was frustrating as many other Covid measures have been eased. The Welsh Government has said it appreciated how difficult it was for people to say goodbye to their loved ones with the current restrictions. But it said the limit on funeral numbers was still necessary to help prevent the spread of the virus. ""We know that this is a difficult time for people who are grieving the loss of a loved one, and we want to offer our deepest sympathies,"" a Welsh Government spokesperson said. ""We are keeping the situation under review and will make changes to the regulations as soon as it is safe to do so."" Ffion Evans said her grandfather, who died aged 87, was a ""kind and loving man"" who will be greatly missed by his family and friends. She said the family had to make the difficult decision to limit the number of people who could attend his funeral due to the current restrictions. ""It was really frustrating because so many other things have been lifted now,"" she said. ""I understand that they're trying to keep people safe, but it was still hard to have to tell people they couldn't come."" Ffion said the family were able to live-stream the funeral so that other people could watch it online. ""It was nice to be able to share it with other people who couldn't be there,"" she said. ""But it's not the same as being able to hug them and to be together in person."" The Welsh Government has said it is working with faith groups and funeral directors to develop guidance on how to hold funerals safely during the pandemic. It said it would continue to keep the situation under review and would make changes to the regulations as soon as it was safe to do so.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fallen Yosemite climbers were 'very experienced',"Jason Wells, 46, and Tim Klein, 42, had climbed together for decades, including in the California park. Officials are investigating how they both fell over 1,000ft (300m) from the granite rock. The climbers were about 2,000ft up El Capitan - almost two thirds of the way to the summit - when they fell. They had been preparing to abseil back down. Yosemite National Park spokeswoman Jamie Richards said the pair were ""very experienced climbers"" who knew the route well. They fell just after 11:00 local time on Saturday (18:00 GMT) while on the Salathé Wall route. Witnesses saw two bodies on the ground at the base of the cliff. Search and rescue teams recovered the bodies but officials have not yet said how the climbers fell. Park spokeswoman Jamie Richards said the pair reached the summit of El Capitan on Friday, and were preparing to rappel down when they fell. ""They were descending from the top of El Capitan when something happened and caused both climbers to fall,"" she said. ""Our hearts go out to their families and loved ones."" The park service is investigating the accident and said it will release more information when it is available. El Capitan is one of the most popular climbing destinations in the world, and is known for its sheer granite walls. The Salathé Wall route is considered one of the most challenging on El Capitan, and requires climbers to ascend over 3,000ft of rock. In May, three climbers were killed in an avalanche on the mountain. Yosemite National Park is home to some of the world's most famous rock climbing routes, and attracts climbers from all over the world. However, the park also has a history of climbing accidents. In 2017, a British climber fell to his death while attempting to free-climb El Capitan. Despite the risks, climbers continue to flock to Yosemite to challenge themselves on its iconic rock formations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tinder to introduce in-app background checks,"By Cody Godwin BBC News, San Francisco Later this year, Tinder will allow users to view public records information of perspective dates using their name or mobile number. The feature, called ""Background Check,"" will be powered by Garbo, a non-profit organization that searches public records for potentially harmful information. Tinder says it will be the first social media company to offer such a service. The announcement comes as Tinder faces increasing scrutiny over its safety record. In recent years, the app has been linked to several high-profile cases of violence and abuse. In 2019, a woman was murdered by a man she met on Tinder. Tinder has since implemented several safety features, including a ""panic button"" that allows users to call for help if they feel unsafe. However, the company has been criticized for not doing enough to protect its users. The new background check feature is designed to address these concerns. It will allow users to see if a potential date has any criminal convictions, restraining orders, or other public records that could indicate a risk of harm. Tinder says that users will have the option to opt out of the background check feature. However, the company hopes that most users will choose to use it, as it could help to make the app safer. ""We believe that this new feature will help to make Tinder a safer place for our users,"" said Tinder CEO Elie Seidman. ""We want to give our users the tools they need to make informed decisions about who they're matching with."" The background check feature is still in development and is expected to launch later this year. Here are some additional details about the feature: The background check will be powered by Garbo, a non-profit organization that searches public records for potentially harmful information. Users will have the option to opt out of the background check feature. The background check will be free to use. The background check will only include information that is available in public records. The background check will not include any information that is protected by law, such as medical records or financial information.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday. They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal. The guidance is based on expert advice from Public Health England and has been developed in consultation with members of the British Film Commission and Pact, the UK's trade association for the creative industries. It includes measures to ensure that filming can take place safely in a variety of locations, including studios, outside broadcasts and on location. Key measures include: Social distancing: All cast and crew members must maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from each other at all times. This may mean using green screens or other techniques to create the illusion of close proximity. Hygiene: All cast and crew members must wash their hands regularly and wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate. The use of hand sanitiser will be mandatory on set. Testing: Cast and crew members may be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. This will help to identify and isolate any individuals who may be infected with the virus. The guidance also includes specific measures for different types of filming, such as: Studio filming: Studio filming will be limited to a maximum of 50 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Outside broadcasts: Outside broadcasts will be limited to a maximum of 25 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Location filming: Location filming will be limited to a maximum of 10 people on set at any one time. All cast and crew members will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.

MoT changes come into force in Northern Ireland,"Under the new rules, more than 20 extra checks will be carried out on vehicles. The checks relate mostly to safety-critical items, such as tyres, brakes, lights, steering and suspension. The changes have been brought in to improve road safety and reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions. The new rules mean that drivers of all vehicles, including cars, vans, motorbikes and buses, will need to have their vehicles tested more frequently. Cars and small vans will need to be tested every two years, instead of every three years. Larger vehicles, such as buses and lorries, will need to be tested every year. The new rules also mean that the tests will be more comprehensive. More than 20 extra checks will be carried out on each vehicle, including: Checking the tread depth of tyres Checking the condition of brakes Checking the condition of lights Checking the condition of steering and suspension Checking for any leaks or damage to the vehicle The changes have been welcomed by road safety campaigners, who say they will help to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions. However, some garage owners have expressed concern about the increased workload that the new rules will create. They say that they may have to increase their prices to cover the cost of the extra tests. The Department for Infrastructure has said that it will be working with the garage industry to ensure that the new rules are implemented smoothly. It is important to note that the new rules only apply to vehicles that are registered in Northern Ireland. Vehicles that are registered in other parts of the UK will not need to be tested more frequently. If you are unsure whether your vehicle needs to be tested, you can check the MOT checker on the Department for Infrastructure website. The new MOT rules are just one of a number of measures that the Department for Infrastructure is taking to improve road safety in Northern Ireland. Other measures include: Investing in new road safety infrastructure, such as road signs and traffic lights Educating drivers about the dangers of speeding, drink-driving and other risky behaviours Enforcing the law against dangerous drivers The Department for Infrastructure is committed to making Northern Ireland's roads safer for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The couple exchanged rings and vows in front of their family and friends, including celebrities such as Roger Moore and Naomi Campbell. After the ceremony, the couple rode in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Monaco, waving to the cheering crowds. They then attended a reception at the Opera House, where they danced and mingled with their guests. The wedding was a major event in Monaco and drew worldwide attention. It was seen as a symbol of the country's continued status as a glamorous and exclusive destination. However, the wedding was also overshadowed by controversy. In the days leading up to the ceremony, there were rumors that the bride had tried to leave the country and that she was only marrying Prince Albert because of his wealth and status. These rumors were denied by the palace, but they cast a shadow over the wedding and raised questions about the couple's future. Despite the controversy, the wedding was a success and was celebrated by the people of Monaco. It was a reminder of the country's rich history and its continued appeal as a destination for the rich and famous.

BCP Council leader Vikki Slade ousted in second confidence vote loss,"Lib Dem Vikki Slade failed to win support over a Tory motion stating ""a high level of public frustration and mistrust"" in her administration. She had led Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council since May 2019, under the Unity Alliance. A coalition of Labour, Independent and Green councillors voted with the Conservatives, leaving the Lib Dems and two Independent councillors supporting Vikki Slade. The motion was triggered by a string of public rows that have made national headlines, including an investigation into the deputy leader Cllr Philip Broadhead who was accused of sexual harassment. Cllr Slade was also criticized over a council tax increase, and the collapse of a suspended pier project, which the leader had strongly supported. The vote was the second time the Conservative group had put forward a motion of no confidence in Vikki Slade. In January, only the Conservative councillors supported the motion, with Labour, Green and Independent councillors abstaining, and Lib Dems voting against it. In a statement Vikki Slade said: ""I am disappointed with the outcome of tonight's vote and believe that it is a huge loss for local democracy. ""I am deeply saddened that councillors have chosen to put party politics before the best interests of the residents of BCP. ""Throughout my time as leader I have always put the needs of residents first and worked tirelessly to deliver the best possible services in an extremely challenging financial environment."" The council said it would now begin the process of electing a new leader. The Unity Alliance was formed by the Lib Dems, the Conservatives, and two Independent councillors, in May 2019. The agreement was intended to give the Lib Dems control of the council, while giving the Conservatives a greater influence than they would have had in opposition. However, the coalition has been dogged by rows, with the Conservatives and Lib Dems clashing over a number of issues. The Tories had already withdrawn from the alliance in 2022, leaving the Lib Dems in a minority administration. A full council meeting will be held on 15 March to determine a new leader of the council.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Mr Holloway said: ""I believe an airport on the Isle of Grain could bring many benefits to north Kent, but it is important that the local community is consulted and their views are taken into account."" The MPs' meeting with Moylan came after a leaked letter revealed that the aviation industry lobby group had offered to provide them with ""research and other materials"" to help them make their case for an airport. The letter, from Moylan to Tory MP Mark Francois, said: ""We would be delighted to provide you with any research and other materials you may need to help you make your case."" The offer was made after Francois had written to Moylan asking for help in persuading the government to support an airport on the Isle of Grain. The Department for Transport said it was ""not considering"" an airport on the Isle of Grain. An airport on the Isle of Grain has been proposed for decades, but it has always been met with strong local opposition. A public inquiry into the proposal in 2003 concluded that an airport would have a ""significant adverse impact"" on the environment and local communities. The Isle of Grain is a peninsula on the south bank of the River Thames, between the towns of Gravesend and Sheerness. It is home to a number of oil refineries and other industrial facilities. An airport on the Isle of Grain would be close to the proposed site of the Lower Thames Crossing, a new bridge and tunnel that would link Kent with Essex. The government has said it is committed to building the Lower Thames Crossing, but it has not yet confirmed when the project will be completed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Unilever: Ice cream in, personal hygiene out in lockdown","The firm said ice cream sales leapt 26% in the three months to June, but demand for shampoo and deodorant fell. It said it had seen strong ""growth in home consumption of foods, ice cream and tea"" during lockdown. But hair salons and barbers being closed meant customers bought less shampoo, hair conditioner and hair spray. And with people spending more time at home, it said, they were using less deodorant. Unilever's sales overall fell by 1.6% between April and June, as sales of its beauty and personal care products dropped by 7.2%. However, sales of its food and refreshments products rose by 4.6%. The Anglo-Dutch company, which also owns brands including Dove soap, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Marmite spread, said it had seen ""encouraging"" signs of recovery in China, where the coronavirus pandemic began.  But it said the outlook in other markets was ""highly uncertain"" due to the potential for further lockdowns. ""Covid-19 continues to have a significant impact on people's lives and livelihoods, and this is reflected in our first half results,"" said chief executive Alan Jope.  ""In response, we have accelerated our plans to simplify our business by making portfolio choices that enhance our focus on fewer, bigger brands and markets where we can deliver superior returns. We are also continuing to invest in our long-term growth priorities, such as digitalisation, e-commerce and sustainability."" Unilever, which has its headquarters in London and Rotterdam, said it had raised its prices in order to offset a 4% rise in the cost of its raw materials. The company, the world's second largest consumer goods maker, has been reviewing its business in recent months. In March it announced plans to sell off its tea business, which includes the PG Tips and Lipton brands, in order to focus on faster growing areas.

Nick Grimshaw's Radio 1 debut impresses critics,"The Telegraph's Michael Hogan was impressed by Grimshaw's ""youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music"". The Guardian's Elisabeth Mahoney said Grimshaw made a confident debut. It was ""a very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to shove off and go and die"". The Independent's Andy Gill was less enthusiastic, describing the show as ""a bit of a curate's egg"" and saying that Grimshaw's ""flippancy and over-familiarity"" were off-putting. However, he did praise Grimshaw's ""decent taste in music"". Overall, the critics were divided in their opinions of Grimshaw's debut. However, the general consensus was that he had made a promising start and that he had the potential to be a successful radio presenter.

Grimshaw's show became one of the most popular on the station, and he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces in British broadcasting. Grimshaw's success on Radio 1 was not without its critics. Some accused him of being too ""mainstream"" and of not playing enough alternative music. However, Grimshaw remained unfazed by these criticisms. He continued to play the music that he loved and to connect with his audience in his own unique way. In 2018, Grimshaw announced that he would be leaving Radio 1 after six years. He said that he wanted to ""try something different"" and that he was ""excited for the future"". Grimshaw's departure from Radio 1 was met with sadness by many of his fans. However, they wished him well in his future endeavors. Grimshaw's legacy at Radio 1 is one of success and innovation.

Lancashire County Council election: Tories gain control,"The authority had been under no overall control, with Labour the biggest party by four councillors. Nationally, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) suffered huge losses, but they did manage to gain the Padiham and Burnley West ward on. UKIP's gain was Labour's loss, with sitting Labour councillor Christine Fogarty losing her seat to UKIP's Paul Parker by 67 votes. Mr Parker was joined by UKIP's Alan Hosker, who saw off competition from four other candidates with 60% of the vote. Elsewhere in Burnley, the three sitting Conservative councillors in the Daneshouse with Stoneyholme ward all retained their seats. In Pendle, victory for the Conservatives in the Vivary Bridge ward means Labour have lost control of the council. The Tories gained the seat from Labour by the narrowest of margins - just four votes - after recounts. Nigel Eden, Paul McKenna and Graham Roach took the seats for the Conservatives. It's the first time the Conservatives have taken overall control of Pendle since it was created out of the local government reorganisation in 1974. For Labour, it's the first time since 1987 that they have not controlled the council. In Hyndburn, Labour maintained control despite losing Rishton ward to the Conservatives. However, Labour's losses did mean the party's majority was reduced from 16 to eight. In Rossendale, Labour managed to gain a seat from the Conservatives in the Eden ward, meaning they retained control of the council with 21 councillors. Liberal Democrats held onto all three of their seats in the Lancaster City Council elections. In Wyre, the Conservatives gained two seats from Labour and one from the Liberal Democrats. The Tories now control the council with 18 councillors to Labour's 12. Overall, the results were a mixed bag for the Conservatives, who made gains in some areas but lost ground in others. However, the party's victory in Pendle will be seen as a major achievement, and it will be interesting to see how they use their new-found power.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

UK plans £3m no-deal medicine transport,"UK plans £3m no-deal medicine transport By Howard Mustoe & Joe Miller Business reporter It wants to hire an ""express freight service"" to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue. But experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the contract is ""unachievable"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the new service would help ensure ""critical medicines"" would be available in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, but it is not yet clear what will happen to trade between the two sides after that date. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it could lead to delays at the border, which could affect the supply of medicines. The DHSC said the new express freight service would be used to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue from suppliers in the EU to the UK. The service would be used in addition to the existing arrangements for transporting medicines, which include air and sea freight. The DHSC said it was ""working closely with the pharmaceutical industry and hauliers to ensure that we have the capacity and capability to deliver medicines to patients in all circumstances."" However, experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the contract is ""unachievable"". John Kearney, the chief executive of the British International Freight Association, said it would be ""impossible"" to get a new express freight service up and running by 1 September. He said: ""The logistics industry is already stretched to capacity, and there is no spare capacity available to set up a new service by that date."" The DHSC said it was ""confident"" that it would be able to award the contract by 1 September.

Russia halts Lithuania dairy imports in trade row,"Russia has halted all imports of Lithuanian dairy produce in a widening trade row between the two countries. Russia's consumer watchdog said the levels of yeast and mould in Lithuanian dairy produce were unacceptable. Lithuania is already involved in a bitter dispute with Russia over the cost of gas imports from Russia's Gazprom energy giant. The Russian consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said its inspections of Lithuanian dairy products found ""unacceptable levels of yeast and mould"". The watchdog said it had banned imports of all Lithuanian dairy products with immediate effect. Lithuanian officials have rejected the allegations, saying that their dairy products meet all EU safety standards. The Lithuanian government has accused Russia of using the dairy ban as a political tool to pressure Lithuania into accepting higher gas prices. The dairy ban is the latest in a series of trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania. In recent months, Russia has also banned imports of Lithuanian fruit, vegetables, and meat. The trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania are part of a wider pattern of tensions between Russia and the European Union. Russia has been accused of using trade bans and other economic measures to pressure EU countries into supporting its policies. The EU has condemned the Russian trade bans, saying they are illegal and unjustified. The EU has also imposed its own sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The trade disputes between Russia and Lithuania are likely to continue in the coming months. Russia has said that it will not lift the dairy ban until Lithuania agrees to accept higher gas prices. Lithuania has said that it will not accept higher gas prices and that it will continue to challenge the Russian trade bans in the courts.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

British Steel in talks with government to avert collapse,"Sources close to owners Greybull Capital say its future will be discussed at ""ministerial level"". British Steel has admitted it needs further financial support from the government to help it address high energy costs and a downturn in its markets. It employs 3,400 people in the UK, mostly in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire and Teesside, after it was bought out of liquidation in 2016. The government has declined to comment on the prospect of a bailout. The firm is one of the UK's largest steelmakers. It is reportedly losing about £1m a day and will run out of cash by the end of the month unless it can agree on a support package from the government. Government support would be likely to be in the form of loans rather than equity. The steel industry has been hit hard by a combination of factors including: The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, which have led to a surge in gas prices and uncertainty about supply. Falling demand from construction and manufacturing as a result of the economic downturn. Increased competition from China, which has led to a global glut of steel. The UK government has already provided the company with a £30m loan and a £100m guarantee on commercial loans. It is understood that the company is asking for a further £300m to help it through the current crisis. The government is thought to be reluctant to provide further support without guarantees that the company has a long-term future, and that taxpayers' money will be protected. The company is currently carrying out a strategic review of its operations, and it is understood that it is considering selling off some of its assets. Any deal to sell the company would likely need the approval of the government, which has a ""golden share"" in the company that gives it the right to veto any sale. The government has said that it is committed to supporting the steel industry, but it is also mindful of the need to protect taxpayers' money.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""I think the UK has certainly strengths and it has weaknesses also, and I think it's important to recognise that the position in which the UK economy is today is not as strong as it could have been,"" she said. ""Having said that, it has some strengths that should enable it to go through with the process in a satisfactory manner, but there will be pain and there will be a slowdown and there will be some adjustments that the UK economy will have to go through."" Her comments come as the UK government prepares to start the process of negotiating its exit from the European Union. The government has said that it wants to leave the single market and the customs union, and to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. However, there is uncertainty about what kind of deal the UK will be able to negotiate, and how long the process will take. Ms Lagarde said that the UK economy was not as well prepared for Brexit as it could have been, and that there would be some pain ahead.

""I think it's important for the UK government to be as transparent as possible about the potential impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and to be honest with the British people about what the challenges will be,"" she said. The UK government has said that it is committed to transparency, and that it will provide regular updates on the progress of the Brexit negotiations.

US 'may free Israel spy Jonathan Pollard',"A US official told the New York Times that no decisions had been made, but confirmed there had been discussions. Pollard, who was granted Israeli citizenship in 1995, is serving a life sentence for passing thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents to Israel in the 1980s. He was arrested in 1985 and has been in prison ever since. In 2015, the Obama administration commuted Pollard's sentence by five years, making him eligible for parole in November 2018. However, the Trump administration has not yet made a decision on whether to release him. Pollard's case has been the subject of much debate over the years. Some argue that he is a traitor who deserves to remain in prison, while others believe that he has already served his time and should be released. Pollard's supporters, including many members of the Israeli government, have argued that he was treated unfairly and should be released on humanitarian grounds. They point out that he has already served 30 years in prison, which is more than any other American convicted of spying for an ally. Pollard's opponents, including some former US intelligence officials, argue that he is a danger to national security and should never be released. They say that he betrayed his country by providing Israel with highly classified information that could have been used to harm the United States. The decision of whether or not to release Pollard is ultimately up to President Trump. He has not yet indicated what he will do, but he has said that he is aware of the case and is considering all of his options. If Trump decides to release Pollard, it would be a significant diplomatic gesture to Israel. It would also be a controversial decision, as Pollard is a convicted spy who has caused significant damage to the United States. The decision of whether or not to release Pollard is a complex one with no easy answers. It is a decision that will have a significant impact on US-Israeli relations, as well as on Pollard's own life.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors,"Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors By Zoe Kleinman Reporter, BBC News Nadine Dorries was giving a statement in Parliament, on the Cumberlege review, published on Wednesday. The review, which had heard from about 700 women, focused on vaginal mesh to treat incontinence, a problem that mainly affects middle-aged and older women. Vaginal mesh is a synthetic material that is used to treat incontinence and prolapse - in which organs slip down because supporting tissues have weakened. It has been used in more than 100,000 operations in the UK. But the review found that many women had been given mesh implants without fully understanding the risks. Some said they had been pressured into having it and not told about alternatives. Many also complained that their concerns about pain and complications after surgery were ignored by doctors. ""I want to acknowledge today that on too many occasions the experiences of these women were missed, ignored, or dismissed,"" Ms Dorries said. ""I want to say sorry to each and every one of them."" She said the government would now set up a new body to implement the review's recommendations, including a compensation scheme for those who had suffered complications from mesh implants. The review also looked at other types of surgery for incontinence and prolapse. It found that up to a quarter of women who have these operations experience serious complications. The government has promised to invest £50m in research into new treatments for incontinence and prolapse. The Cumberlege review was commissioned by the government in 2020. It was led by Baroness Cumberlege, a crossbench peer who has previously chaired inquiries into other medical scandals. In her report, Baroness Cumberlege said that the mesh scandal was ""the result of a collective failure of the system"". She said that women had been ""failed by the healthcare system, by manufacturers, and by regulators"". She called for a change in the way that mesh is used in the NHS. She said that it should only be used as a last resort, after other treatments have failed. The government has said that it will accept all of the review's recommendations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cladding: MPs fail in bid to change fire safety payment rules,"The Fire Safety Bill - to strengthen regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire - comes after financial help was granted to install better cladding. But flat owners say the rules around who pays are unfair, as more than half a million leaseholders may have to pay tens of thousands of pounds to fix potentially unsafe buildings. In the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, which claimed the lives of 72 people in 2017, the government pledged to improve building safety standards. As part of this, the Building Safety Fund was created to help pay for the removal and replacement of dangerous cladding on high-rise buildings.  However, leaseholders, who own their flats but not the freehold of the building, have argued that they should not be responsible for the costs of replacing unsafe cladding. They say that the responsibility should lie with developers and building owners, who were responsible for installing the unsafe cladding in the first place. The Fire Safety Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, would have introduced a new levy on developers to help pay for the costs of cladding replacement. However, MPs voted against an amendment to the Bill that would have required developers to pay for all the costs of cladding replacement. This means that leaseholders could still be liable for significant costs. Leaseholders have expressed their disappointment at the MPs' decision. They say that they are being unfairly penalized for the mistakes of developers and building owners. They are calling on the government to introduce a fairer system that would protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding replacement. The government has said that it is committed to protecting leaseholders and that it will continue to work on finding a solution to the cladding crisis. However, it is clear that the issue is far from resolved and that leaseholders could still be facing significant costs for cladding replacement. The Fire Safety Bill is expected to become law later this year. It will introduce a number of new measures to improve building safety, including: A new Building Safety Regulator to oversee the safety of high-rise buildings New requirements for developers to provide information about the fire safety of their buildings New powers for local authorities to take action against unsafe buildings The government hopes that these measures will help to prevent another tragedy like the Grenfell Tower fire. However, the issue of cladding replacement remains unresolved and could continue to be a major source of concern for leaseholders.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Manchester attack: Veil of quiet respect descends over city,"By Tom Mullen BBC News Online Tuesday's proud show of solidarity and defiance at a vigil in Albert Square appears to have given way to a sense of deep sadness, with dozens of people pausing to read the many messages left in St Ann's Square. There are flowers, candles and soft toys as well as messages of condolence and support, with some people quietly crying as they read what has been written. A veil of quiet respect has descended over the city centre, with even the trams pausing briefly as they pass the floral tributes which have been left near the scene of the attack. The city's main shopping centre, the Arndale Centre, reopened on Tuesday and, while there were fewer people than usual, those who were there said they felt safe. ""It's nice to be back in the city centre, but it's very strange to think that something so awful happened here,"" said Kelly Williams, 30, a healthcare worker. ""I think people are still in shock, but we're determined to show that we won't be beaten by terrorism. We're a strong city and we'll get through this together.""

BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei,"BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor BT said in time it expected 50% of all its 5G traffic to be transmitted via the Swedish company's kit. The move will let it ditch Huawei, the Chinese company that provides much of the UK's 4G and 5G equipment. The government has ordered telecoms operators to remove all Huawei equipment from their networks by 2027. BT has said it needed ""multiple vendors"" to ensure its network remained competitive. It explained that the Ericsson deal would deliver a ""significant"" number of new 5G sites. ""This deal means we can accelerate the rollout of our 5G network using the latest kit from a trusted and high-quality vendor,"" said Howard Watson, BT's chief technology officer. ""Ericsson's state-of-the-art kit will deliver significant benefits."" But the deal may not solve all BT's technology headaches. For example, it still relies on Huawei for its broadband network kit. And BT will have to balance its relationship with Ericsson with those of its other suppliers, especially Nokia and Samsung. BT owns the UK's largest mobile phone network, EE. Two years ago, BT struck a major deal with Nokia to replace Huawei equipment in the core of its 5G network. But unlike Huawei, Ericsson also has an established radio access network (RAN) hardware business. The RAN is the part of the network that connects mobile phone masts to the core network and the internet. The Huawei ban and other issues had been expected to delay BT's 5G rollout plans. But Mr Watson said the deal with Ericsson would ""accelerate"" its 5G deployment. In a separate statement, Ericsson said it was ""delighted to strengthen our long-standing partnership with BT"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Chevron: Indigenous Ecuadoreans seek higher damages,"By Irene Caselli BBC News, Ecuador A triumphant atmosphere might have been expected as they gathered for a news conference in Quito, given the favourable verdict finally reached in a case that had been grinding through the Ecuadorian and US legal systems for 28 years. But for the four Indigenous leaders, representing more than 30,000 Ecuadorean Amazonians, the moment was bittersweet. ""We never thought it would take so long, so many of our friends died waiting for this verdict. They gave their lives in the struggle,"" said Pablo Fajardo, speaking on behalf of his community, and a member of the Cofan people. The landmark decision by Ecuador's highest court at the end of February found Chevron, the US oil giant, responsible for massive contamination in the Amazon, which included dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into rivers, contaminating the drinking water and killing wildlife. The court upheld a lower court ruling that ordered Chevron to pay $9.5bn (£7bn) in damages - one of the biggest environmental fines in history. Chevron has always denied the allegations and said it will fight the verdict. It says the clean-up was carried out by state-owned oil company Petroecuador, with which it worked in partnership. The Indigenous communities say the environmental disaster has had a devastating impact on their lives. They have suffered serious health problems, including cancer, and contamination of their water supplies has deprived them of their main source of food. ""Our children are fishing in a polluted river... and eating fish that have mercury,"" said Fajardo. ""We feel so much sadness. We have lost everything due to Chevron,"" he said. The communities want more money from Chevron to help them to overcome the damage that has been done. ""The verdict is a first step towards justice, but it should not end there. Chevron must repair the damage it has done and compensate the communities who have suffered,"" said Fajardo. The communities are also calling on the Ecuadorian government to step up its efforts to clean up the contamination. ""The government must play its part. We need a clean-up plan. We need compensation for the damage to our health and environment,"" said Fajardo. The case has been closely watched by environmental groups around the world and is seen as a test case for the accountability of oil giants for the environmental damage they cause.

China morning round-up: Illegal workers,"Shanghai Daily says Vice-Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning told the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Wednesday that the crackdown was aimed at curbing ""smuggling, theft, robbery and other crimes"". Police caught 105,274 illegal workers and 5,670 employers between January and August 2023, and imposed fines totalling 260 million yuan ($37m; £30m), he said. The Global Times said the crackdown was not new and that the authorities had been ""vowing to ensure 'dynamic zero-Covid' and social stability"". It said the police operation involved ""coordinated efforts"" requiring ""multiple city-level departments"". The crackdown is part of a wider drive by the Chinese government to clamp down on illegal activities and maintain social order. In recent months, the authorities have also launched crackdowns on online scams, telecommunications fraud and food safety violations. The Chinese government has long been concerned about the issue of illegal workers, who are often paid less than the minimum wage and lack basic labour protections. In 2019, the government introduced a new law aimed at cracking down on the illegal employment of foreign workers. The crackdown on illegal workers is likely to continue in the coming months as the Chinese government seeks to strengthen its control over the labour market and maintain social stability. The move has been welcomed by some, who say it will help to protect the rights of workers and ensure that businesses are operating fairly. However, others have expressed concern that the crackdown could lead to discrimination against migrant workers and make it more difficult for them to find work. The crackdown is also likely to have a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Illegal workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in many sectors, such as construction and manufacturing. The crackdown could lead to labour shortages and higher labour costs, which could in turn lead to higher prices for goods and services. The crackdown on illegal workers is a complex issue with both positive and negative consequences. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks of the crackdown before making a judgment about its overall impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'I'm gay and I was sexually assaulted by a woman',"By Shiona McCallum Newsbeat reporter He says he ""didn't feel under threat"" by his attacker, Cheryl Cottrell, because she was a woman. The film-maker, who is gay, has been struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts since. ""I didn't feel like I was under threat from her because I knew women can't physically overpower men,"" he says. ""But it doesn't change the fact that I was sexually assaulted. I still felt like a victim."" He says the culture surrounding male victims of sexual violence makes it hard for them to come forward and speak out about their experiences. ""There's a lot of stigma around men being victims of sexual assault,"" he says. ""There's this idea that men are supposed to be strong and powerful, and that if they're assaulted then they're not a 'real man'. ""This needs to change. Men need to be able to come forward and talk about their experiences without feeling ashamed or embarrassed."" He hopes that by speaking out about his experience, he can help to break down the stigma surrounding male victims of sexual violence. ""I want people to understand that sexual assault can happen to anyone, regardless of their gender,"" he says. ""I want men to know that they're not alone, and that if they've been assaulted, they should come forward and seek help.""

Brexit: Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity',"Construction work on a site off the M20 near Ashford began earlier this month. One resident labelled the plans ""sneaky"", stating she had not been told about them. The Department for Transport said ""commercial sensitivities made it impossible to engage with local residents"" before work started. The site is one of three disused airfields, along with Manston in Kent and Stanford in Essex, being transformed into lorry parks for Operation Brock, which is intended to reduce disruption at the Port of Dover in the event of cross-Channel disruption. But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke and Ashford MP Damian Green have raised concerns about the impact on the local area following complaints from residents. The MPs said the airfields were ""completely the wrong locations"" for the lorry parks and called on the government to reconsider. The government said the sites were chosen for their ""good access to motorways"" and other nearby infrastructure. However, residents in Sevington, a village on the outskirts of Ashford, have expressed anger at the lack of consultation over the plans. ""It's like a concrete monstrosity,"" said one resident, who asked not to be named. ""It's going to ruin our village."" Another resident said he had not been told about the plans until work started. ""I'm really concerned about the impact it's going to have on the environment,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of wildlife around here and this is just going to destroy it."" The Department for Transport said it had been ""engaging with local residents and businesses throughout the planning and development process"". ""We understand that some residents may have concerns about the impact of the lorry park on their local area,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are committed to working with the local community to address these concerns and minimize any disruption."" But residents say they have not been given enough information about the plans. ""We've been completely ignored,"" said one resident. ""The government hasn't even bothered to tell us what's going on."" The government has said the lorry parks will be temporary and will only be used when necessary to ease congestion at the Port of Dover. However, residents fear that the parks will become permanent fixtures and that their villages will be blighted by noise, pollution, and traffic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Love Island to return this summer, ITV confirms","However, the broadcaster has not announced any further details, such as the location of the villa. Previous summer series have taken place in Mallorca, but reports this week suggested ITV had identified a new location in Italy. The series will be the first full series to air since the winter version was shown in January 2023. It was won by Finn Tapp and Paige Turley, who remain one of only two Love Island couples still together from their winning series. The first series of Love Island aired in 2015 and was won by Jess Hayes and Max Morley. Since then, the show has become one of ITV's most popular, with over 20 million viewers tuning in for the 2022 final. The show has also been a success internationally, with versions of Love Island airing in over 20 countries. The US version of the show, which airs on CBS, is currently in its fourth season. Love Island has been praised for its entertainment value and for introducing viewers to new personalities. However, it has also been criticised for its lack of diversity and for promoting unrealistic body standards. In recent years, ITV has made efforts to address these criticisms. In 2021, the broadcaster introduced new rules to ensure that all contestants are treated with respect and that there is no bullying or harassment. ITV has also committed to increasing the diversity of the show's contestants. In 2022, the show featured its first ever deaf contestant, Tasha Ghouri. The return of Love Island is sure to be a major event in the television calendar. The show is expected to be full of drama, romance, and plenty of sunshine.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Preston GP struck off over 'dishonest' food poisoning claims,"A tribunal found the actions of Dr Zuber Bux, who practised in the Preston area in Lancashire, were ""misleading, dishonest and financially motivated"". The panel also proved he failed to declare his wife Sehana Bux, who helped run his clinics, as a director of his company. The tribunal heard evidence that Dr Bux had claimed to be a travel health expert and recommended unnecessary vaccinations to around 1,300 patients. He also provided letters to patients claiming they had food poisoning, which they could use to claim compensation from travel companies. The tribunal chairman, Dr Nigel Murray, said: ""The repeated, dishonest claims made by Dr Zuber Bux were rooted in financial gain. He sought to portray himself as an expert in travel health, when in fact he had no such expertise. ""His actions were a betrayal of the trust placed in him by his patients and brought the medical profession into disrepute."" Dr Bux qualified as a doctor in Pakistan in 1987 and moved to the UK in 1990. He worked as a GP in the Preston area for many years and was the medical director of two clinics, Travel Clinic UK and Bux Medical Centre. In 2016, the General Medical Council (GMC) began an investigation into Dr Bux's conduct after receiving a number of complaints from patients. The investigation found that Dr Bux had been making false claims about his qualifications and experience, and that he had been providing patients with unnecessary vaccinations. Dr Bux was suspended from practising medicine in 2017 and the GMC referred his case to a tribunal. The tribunal heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including patients who had been treated by Dr Bux. The tribunal found that Dr Bux had breached a number of GMC rules, including those relating to honesty, integrity and financial probity. The tribunal also found that he had failed to declare his wife as a director of his company, which was a breach of company law. The tribunal's decision to strike Dr Bux off the medical register means that he will no longer be able to practise medicine in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Teletubbies creator 'sad' about show's remake,"Wood, 77, told Radio Times she is not a fan of the trend for remaking old shows such as Dangermouse. ""I think we've got to move on,"" she argued. ""There's still room for new ideas."" Wood created Teletubbies with her husband, Andrew Davenport, and it first aired on BBC Two in 1997. The show quickly became a global hit, with its distinctive characters, bright colors, and soothing narrations. However, it has also been criticized for its slow pace and repetitive plots. Despite the criticism, Teletubbies has remained popular with young children, and it has been praised for its educational value. In 2015, it was named one of the BBC's most popular children's shows of all time. The remake of Teletubbies is being produced by DHX Media, the Canadian company that bought the rights to the show in 2013. The new series will feature a new cast of actors and a number of changes to the original format. Wood said she has not been involved in the remake and does not know much about it. However, she said she is ""sad"" that her show is being remade. ""I think it's a shame,"" she said. ""I think it's a beautiful show, and it's a shame to see it remade."" Wood's comments come at a time when there is a growing trend for remaking old children's shows. In recent years, there have been remakes of shows such as Thunderbirds, The Wombles, and The Clangers. Some critics argue that this trend is a sign of a lack of creativity in the television industry. However, others argue that remakes can introduce classic shows to a new generation of viewers. It remains to be seen whether the new Teletubbies series will be a success. However, Wood's comments suggest that she is unlikely to be a fan.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Depression: 'Second biggest cause of disability' in world,"By Helen Briggs BBC News The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other health conditions and found that it is the second leading cause of disability worldwide and the top cause in several countries including the UK, US and Australia. The researchers estimated that more than 300 million people globally are living with depression, and it could cost the world economy more than $1 trillion (£750 bn) a year. That's in lost productivity, as well as direct healthcare costs. The study, funded by the World Health Organization, also found that depression is more disabling than many other chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Lead researcher Professor Alize Ferrari of the University of Queensland in Australia said: ""Our findings show that mental disorders, and in particular depression, are not only common, but they cause more suffering and disability than most other conditions."" ""This means that depression should be one of the main health challenges that governments and health systems address for their populations worldwide."" The researchers hope the study will help convince governments and health organisations to invest more resources in mental health. ""Depression can be treated, but too often does not get the attention it deserves,"" said Prof Ferrari. ""We need to reduce the stigma associated with depression so people can come forward and seek help to manage their illness."" She said mental health services should be available and affordable for all. ""We need to move depression from the margins to the mainstream of health."" The study was based on data from 188 countries and analysed information from the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease Study, which includes information on 301 health conditions and their impact on population health. The researchers calculated the disability caused by depression using a measure called years lived with disability (YLDs). YLDs measure the number of years lived with a health condition, weighted to reflect the severity of the condition. The researchers found that people with depression had an average of 8.9 YLDs, which is more than the number of YLDs for diabetes (5.3), heart disease (4.7), and cancer (3.7). The study also found that the number of YLDs for depression has increased by more than 50% since 1990. The researchers say this is due to a number of factors, including population growth, ageing, and changes in lifestyle. They also say that the increase in YLDs for depression may be due to better diagnosis and reporting of the condition. However, they say that more research is needed to understand the reasons for the increase.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pound rises on Brexit 'progress' report,"Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News. However, the pound later gave up some of its gains after London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned that the UK capital's financial services industry could lose up to 100,000 jobs if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The reports from Brussels suggested that the EU and the UK were close to agreeing on a withdrawal deal, but that there were still some ""significant obstacles"" to overcome. The reports also suggested that the UK government was preparing to offer a ""significant financial incentive"" to the EU to help secure a deal. The pound has been volatile in recent weeks as investors try to assess the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Sterling fell to a 28-month low against the US dollar in August, but has since recovered some of its losses. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. If the UK leaves without a deal, it will mean that there will be no transition period and businesses will have to adapt to new trading arrangements overnight. This could lead to disruption to trade and a fall in the value of the pound. The EU has said that it is willing to grant the UK a transition period, but only if the UK agrees to pay a ""divorce bill"" of up to £40bn. The UK government has said that it is willing to pay a ""reasonable"" divorce bill, but has not yet agreed to the EU's figure. The negotiations between the UK and the EU are ongoing and it is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach a deal before the UK leaves the EU. If the UK does leave without a deal, it could have a significant impact on the UK economy and the value of the pound.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Europe-wide police operation busts horsemeat racket,"Police in Spain made 65 arrests for crimes including animal abuse, forgery, money laundering and racketeering. Horses in Portugal and Spain deemed unfit for consumption were slaughtered and their meat passed off as beef, police said. Europol, the EU's police agency, said the meat was sold in at least 25 countries across Europe, including the UK, France, Italy and Portugal. Some of it found its way into products destined for children, including burgers and lasagne. The operation began in February 2022, when Spanish police discovered horses being slaughtered in conditions that breached regulations. They found signs of ill-treatment, including animals with open wounds and broken bones. Police also discovered that the horses had been given drugs to make them appear younger and healthier. The meat was then sold to slaughterhouses and meat traders, who passed it off as beef. As well as the arrests in Spain, police in Portugal, France, Italy and the UK made a further 10 arrests. Europol said the operation had dismantled a ""major criminal network"" involved in the horsemeat racket. The operation is the latest in a series of investigations into the horsemeat trade in Europe. In 2013, a major scandal broke out when it was revealed that horsemeat had been found in products sold in supermarkets across Europe. The scandal led to a number of changes in the way that horsemeat is regulated in Europe. However, the latest operation suggests that the trade in horsemeat is still a problem. In a statement, Europol said the operation had ""demonstrated the importance of cooperation between law enforcement agencies across Europe"". ""This investigation has shown that the illegal horsemeat trade is a serious issue that poses a risk to public health and animal welfare,"" the statement said. ""Europol will continue to work with its partners to tackle this problem and bring those responsible to justice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sheffield shooting: Drive-by gunman guilty of attempted murder,"The boy suffered serious leg injuries when Stephen Dunford, 25, opened fire on a group of people in Northern Avenue, Sheffield, from a passing car. He was later recorded in jail bragging about the attack, saying he had ""burst"" his victim's kneecap and that he ""deserved it"" for disrespectful comments made in the past. Dunford, of no fixed address, was found guilty of attempted murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday after a trial lasting almost four weeks. He will be sentenced on 29 March. The court heard how Dunford had been driving a black Audi A3 when he pulled up alongside a group of people in the street at about 18:00 GMT on 23 July last year. He wound down the window and fired four shots from a handgun towards the group. One of the bullets hit the boy in the leg, causing serious injuries. He was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery. Dunford fled the scene but was later arrested by police. When interviewed, he denied being involved in the shooting, but his DNA was found on the gun and in the car. The jury heard that Dunford had been friends with the victim's family but had fallen out with them after an argument. He had made threats to harm the victim in the past. In a statement released after the verdict, the victim's family said: ""We are relieved that Stephen Dunford has been found guilty of attempted murder. This has been a very difficult time for us, but we are grateful to the police and the jury for their hard work in bringing him to justice.

A killer's compulsion undimmed by time,"By Graeme Ogston BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter Sobs from the public seats from those whose lives he had changed forever, the passion in the Crown's closing speech, and the almost emotionless delivery of his own defence - there were many layers to the Ian Brady sentencing hearing. It was the culmination of years of patient and determined work by detectives, lawyers and forensic experts. The evil and the banality had co-existed in Brady throughout his life and both were present in court. His voice devoid of any emotion as he addressed the judge, Brady described himself as a ""political prisoner"" and accused the authorities of a ""witch hunt"". He made the bizarre claim that the Moors murders were somehow linked to his republican activities in Glasgow. It was clear though that the evidence against him was overwhelming. The description of his offending as ""grotesque and wicked beyond belief"" was not an exaggeration. The Crown narrative, illustrated by chilling black and white photographs, charted the manipulative grooming of vulnerable young victims, their torture, sexual abuse and murder. Brady maintained his innocence but the evidence against him was overwhelming. He and Myra Hindley lured five children to their deaths in the 1960s. Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans were subjected to unimaginable horrors before being murdered. In 1985, Brady was convicted of the murders of John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans and jailed for life. Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 for her part in the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey. She died in prison in 2002. Brady's bid to overturn his convictions in 2001 failed and he had been held at the high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside since 1985. He died in May 2017 at the age of 79. The judge who sentenced Brady to life in prison described him as ""wicked beyond belief"". In his closing speech, the prosecutor said that Brady's crimes were ""so heinous that they beggar belief"". He said that Brady was a ""sadistic and calculating killer"" who had shown no remorse for his crimes. Brady's crimes shocked the nation and continue to haunt those who were affected by them. His death brought an end to a chapter in British criminal history, but the pain and suffering he inflicted will never be forgotten.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Labour would also introduce a new 10-year NHS cancer plan, providing more treatments and support for patients. Mr Jones said: ""Cancer is a terrible disease that affects so many people."" ""We want to give people the best possible chance of beating it, and this plan will help us to do that."" The party would also create 100,000 apprenticeships, with a focus on new technologies and skills. Mr Jones said: ""We need to make sure that our young people have the skills they need to compete in the modern economy."" ""These apprenticeships will give them the chance to earn and learn, and to build a successful future for themselves."" Labour would also introduce free childcare for all three and four-year-olds, regardless of their family income.

""We want to make it easier for parents to balance their work and family life, and to give our children the best possible start in life."" Finally, Labour would introduce a scheme to help older people sell their homes to pay for care. Mr Jones said: ""We know that many older people are struggling to pay for care, and that can put a real strain on their finances."" ""This scheme would give them the option to sell their home, and to receive a lump sum that they can use to pay for their care.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ulster Bank apologises as thousands unable to access money,"It apologised for Monday evening's problems and said it would compensate anyone left out of pocket. Customers said they could not use cash machines, debit cards or access online or telephone banking.

Victims' Code criticised by watchdog,"Victims' Code criticised by watchdog Parliamentary Ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor said an investigation of complaints had exposed a lack of understanding. It came as ministers unveiled plans to revamp the code, which tells people what to expect from police, courts and other agencies after they have been a victim of crime. The code was introduced in April last year. Dame Julie was asked to look into it after receiving a high volume of complaints. Her report, published on Wednesday, found that complainants often did not understand the code and were not given enough information by agencies at the outset. She said victims were often forced to chase up agencies to find out about their case and that some agencies had a ""narrow and minimalist"" approach to the code. Dame Julie said: ""I am concerned that the Victims' Code is not currently providing all victims with the information and support they have a right to expect. ""The code must be made easier to understand and agencies must be given clearer guidance on how to implement it effectively. ""I hope that my recommendations will help to improve the experience of victims and ensure that they are treated with the respect and compassion they deserve."" Dame Julie made a number of recommendations, including: The code should be simplified and made easier to understand Agencies should provide more information to victims at the outset Agencies should be given clearer guidance on how to implement the code There should be an independent body to monitor the implementation of the code Justice Minister Sir Oliver Heald said the government was ""committed to improving the experience of victims"". He said: ""We will carefully consider the ombudsman's recommendations and will set out our response in due course.""

It was introduced in April 2015 and replaced the previous Code of Practice for Victims of Crime. The code covers a range of issues, including: Information and support for victims The right to make a victim personal statement The right to be kept informed about the progress of their case The right to attend court hearings The right to compensation",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"'Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council","Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council By Hannah Richardson BBC News education reporter Buckinghamshire County Council's comments came in response to a school wanting to use 11-plus results to decide who gets priority on new places. The council's response said that the test ""is an imperfect measure of ability"" and that ""it is well known that family income and wealth are closely linked with attainment at 11"". This would mean that ""the pupils who would most benefit from a grammar school education would be less likely to secure a place"". Former education secretary Justine Greening said the claims were ""a deeply depressing indictment of the current system"". She said: ""It's a further indication that the system is failing too many children from disadvantaged backgrounds."" But a spokesman for the Grammar Schools Heads Association said there was no evidence the 11-plus ""works against pupils from poorer backgrounds"". He said: ""In fact, there is evidence to suggest the opposite, that grammar schools help to close the attainment gap."" The National Education Union believes the focus should be on improving results for all pupils, rather than creating a two-tier system. Joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The NEU's position is that we do not support selective education. ""We would prefer to see all schools supported and funded to improve the academic achievement of the whole school community."" The debate over grammar schools has been reignited by the government's plans to open new ones. The government says that grammar schools will help to raise standards for all pupils, but critics argue that they will lead to a more segregated and unequal education system. The 11-plus is a test that is taken by children in England at the age of 11. The results of the test are used to decide which children will go to grammar schools, which are selective schools that are often seen as being the best schools in the country. The test is controversial, with some people arguing that it is unfair and that it discriminates against children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Milk cuts campaign launched by Scottish farmers,"It comes after Robert Wiseman, Britain's biggest fresh milk company, said it would reduce the farm-gate milk price by 1.7p a litre from 1 August. Wiseman blamed the ""increasing pressure"" of cheaper imported milk, with the UK seeing record levels of dairy imports in recent months. The Scottish government said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Wiseman's decision, and that it would ""stand up for Scotland's dairy industry"". ""Dairy farmers are facing a significant challenge at present, with rising costs and volatile milk prices,"" said Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing. ""The Scottish government will continue to work closely with the industry to find solutions."" The NFU Scotland said Wiseman's decision was a ""kick in the teeth"" for dairy farmers. ""Dairy farmers are already operating on wafer-thin margins, and this price cut will make it even harder for them to make a living,"" said NFU Scotland President Andrew McCornick. ""We urge Wiseman to reconsider this decision."" The Scottish Milk Campaign is calling on consumers to buy Scottish milk and dairy products in a bid to support the industry. ""Scottish milk is some of the best in the world, and we need to do everything we can to support our dairy farmers,"" said campaign coordinator Jean Lamont. ""By buying Scottish milk, you can help to protect one of Scotland's most iconic industries."" The campaign is also calling on the Scottish government to do more to support the dairy industry. ""The Scottish government needs to step up and provide more support for our dairy farmers,"" said Lamont.

"Children in care 'let down for too long', says David Cameron","Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care. New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even if they have a history of challenging behaviour. The article was prompted by the publication of a report from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which found that thousands of children were abused while in care. The inquiry concluded that the state had ""failed"" these children and that there was a ""culture of denial"" about the extent of the abuse. Cameron's article was welcomed by some campaigners, but others said it did not go far enough. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the government needed to do more to ensure that all children in care are safe and that those who have been abused are properly supported. The NSPCC's chief executive, Peter Wanless, said: ""We welcome the prime minister's commitment to 'zero tolerance' of state failure in childcare. However, we believe that the government needs to go further and commit to a national inquiry into the sexual abuse of children in care."" The government has said that it will consider the inquiry's recommendations carefully. However, it is not yet clear what specific measures the government will take to improve the care of children in care. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was set up in 2014 to investigate child sexual abuse in England and Wales over the past 60 years. The inquiry has heard evidence from more than 7,000 victims and witnesses. The inquiry's report found that there was a ""culture of denial"" about the extent of child sexual abuse in care. The report also found that the state had ""failed"" to protect children from abuse and that there were ""systemic failures"" in the care system. The government has apologized for the state's failures to protect children in care.

Rickmansworth man Davey Everson jailed for Millie-Rose Burdett murder,"Davey Everson, 23, had been convicted of the murder of three-month-old Millie-Rose Burdett, who died in hospital on 11 January 2019. A judge at the Old Bailey said he must serve a minimum of 13 years and six months before being considered for release. The court heard that Everson had been in a relationship with Millie-Rose's mother, Nalini Thakor, and had been looking after the baby at their home in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, when she suffered a fatal head injury. Everson initially claimed that Millie-Rose had fallen off a bed, but a post-mortem examination found that she had died from blunt force trauma to the head. Everson was arrested and charged with murder in January 2019. During the trial, the jury heard that Everson had been violent towards Thakor in the past and had threatened to kill her. He had also been seen shaking Millie-Rose on a number of occasions. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said that Everson had shown ""no remorse"" for his actions and had been ""utterly selfish"". He said that the baby had been ""vulnerable and defenceless"" and that Everson had ""taken her life in a moment of anger"". ""This was a cruel and senseless killing of a defenceless baby,"" Judge Lucraft said. ""You have shown no remorse for your actions and you have been utterly selfish. You deserve to spend a long time in prison."" Everson's sentence was welcomed by Millie-Rose's family. In a statement, they said: ""We are relieved that justice has been done and that Davey Everson has been sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment. We hope that this will send a message that violence against children will not be tolerated."" The case of Millie-Rose Burdett's murder has shocked the community of Rickmansworth. Local residents have expressed their anger and sadness at the death of such a young child. A vigil was held in her memory in the town centre in January 2019. The case has also raised awareness of the issue of violence against children. The NSPCC has said that it is ""horrified"" by the death of Millie-Rose and has called for more to be done to protect children from harm.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Lockdown 'could boost wild flowers',"Plantlife has been urging councils for years to cut grass less often. It also wants them to delay cutting until flowers have had chance to seed. The charity says it has seen signs of a change in the management of roadside verges during lockdown. On the M1 near Sheffield, a verge has been left to grow. Plantlife said that this was now a spectacular display of wildflowers. It wants to see verges like this retained on the motorway network as part of the ""nature recovery network"" that the government has proposed. Councils around the country have reported a surge in the number of calls they have received about people spotting wildlife in their areas. This is likely to be because people are spending more time in their local parks and green spaces during lockdown. In one park in Burnley, Lancashire, people have been surprised by the appearance of purple orchids, foxgloves and birdsfoot trefoil. A council spokesman said that the wildflowers had benefited from the reduction in the number of dog walkers and the fact that the grass had not been cut. “The wildflowers are a real joy to see,” he said. “They are a reminder of the importance of protecting our green spaces.” Plantlife is calling for a change in the way that we manage our green spaces. It wants to see a move away from the intensive mowing of verges and parks. This would allow wildflowers to flourish and create a more diverse habitat for wildlife. The charity is also urging people to plant wildflowers in their gardens. This would help to create a network of habitats for pollinators and other insects. “We need to change the way we think about wildflowers,” said Plantlife’s chief executive, Ian Dunn. “They are not just weeds. They are a vital part of our ecosystem.” The lockdown has given us a glimpse of what our green spaces could be like if we managed them differently. Let’s hope that we can learn from this experience and create a more sustainable future for our wildlife.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Russians fly orphan bear to new life,"By News from Elsewhere...as found by BBC Monitoring Villagers in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula found the starving 10-month-old roaming their freezing streets last month, crying out for food. Locals tried to care for the animal, which they named Venza, but realised he needed specialist treatment. A local resident contacted the Kamchatka animal welfare group Wild Rescue Centre and founder Viktoria Ignatieva travelled 120km (75 miles) from the regional capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to collect the bear. She told the BBC's Russian service that at first she didn't want to get involved. ""We don't work with bears,"" she said. ""But then I heard his screams."" Viktoria said Venza was very weak and was having trouble feeding because his teeth had not fully developed. He was dehydrated, malnourished and had wounds on his paws. She was able to find a sponsor who would pay for the bear's flight to Moscow, where he could receive specialist care at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. She then had to wait for several days for permission from the authorities to transport the bear. Viktoria took the opportunity to buy baby food and a bottle with a small teat, which the bear accepted immediately. ""It was difficult to feed him, he was too weak,"" she said. ""After a few hours he was already sleeping on his tummy and dreaming."" Venza's welfare flight was part of a joint initiative from the Wild Rescue Centre and Russian airline S7. The flight attendant monitored Venza throughout the journey, stroking his head and giving him baby food. Venza is now recovering at the Moscow wildlife centre, where he is being introduced to berries and vegetables. The centre's director, Vladimir Burdachevsky, described him as ""very sweet"". ""It's sad that he lost his mother,"" he said. ""But he is in good hands and we will do everything we can to prepare him for life in the wild."" Venza is expected to stay at the centre for up to a year. He will then be released into a protected area in the Russian Far East. Viktoria said: ""We're already thinking about his life in the wild. He has to be ready to live alone. He will be under the supervision of the Kamchatka Natural Resources Ministry, using a GPS tracker."" She added: ""It's the first time in Russia that an orphaned bear cub has been rescued and we hope it sends out the message that we should all care about the wild animals who share this planet with us.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""This is a worrying development and we are working closely with our partners to do everything we can to bring this situation under control.""

Norman Baker: EU would slow down 'legal highs' fight,"By Justin Parkinson Political reporter, BBC News The Liberal Democrat told a parliamentary committee the UK was already in a ""stronger position"" than most states, as it had flexibility to act act quickly. The coalition has banned more than 50 so-called legal highs since coming to power in 2010, with a further 10 substances set to be added to the list by the end of the year. But Mr Baker said the UK could do more and that he was ""disappointed"" the EU had blocked plans for a European-wide ban on psychoactive substances. ""I think we'd be in a stronger position as a country if we weren't part of that process,"" he said. ""We could go ahead with what we were planning and ban these things more quickly than we are able to at the moment."" The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it is not convinced that a ban is the best way to tackle the problem. It has instead proposed a ""balanced"" approach which would include monitoring the market, providing information and support to users, and encouraging research. The commission's position has been backed by some experts, who argue that a ban could simply drive the market underground and make it more difficult to control. But Mr Baker said he was not convinced by these arguments. ""I think the evidence suggests that a ban can be effective in reducing the availability of these substances,"" he said. ""And I think it's important to send a clear message that these substances are not acceptable."" The Home Office has said it is ""disappointed"" by the EU's decision, but that it will continue to work with other countries to tackle the problem. The government has also said it will continue to ban new psychoactive substances as they emerge. In the meantime, Mr Baker said he would be looking at ways to ""speed up"" the process of banning these substances. ""I think we need to be more proactive in this area,"" he said. ""We need to be doing everything we can to protect people from these dangerous substances.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The British Legion's call for a public inquiry comes after a number of high-profile cases of veterans suffering from Gulf War illnesses. In 2019, the BBC reported on the case of Corporal Diane Allen, who died from a rare form of cancer after serving in the Gulf War. Allen's family believe that her cancer was caused by her exposure to depleted uranium, which is used in armor-piercing shells. The Ministry of Defence has denied any link between depleted uranium and Gulf War illnesses. The British Legion's call for a public inquiry is likely to be met with resistance from the government. The government has previously said that there is no evidence to support the claim that Gulf War illnesses are caused by exposure to depleted uranium.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dale Farm eviction: 'Show of force designed to shock',"By Julian Sturdy BBC East The police, the travellers were told, would only be there to maintain the peace and prevent criminality. But, they said, they had broken no laws. So why, they asked, were there 4,000 police officers, many in riot gear, backed up by water cannon and a helicopter? ""We're not moving and we don't know why they're here,"" said Kathleen McCarthy, who along with her husband John has lived at Dale Farm for 20 years. ""We feel let down. We are being treated like animals."" The community living on the Dale Farm site, just off the A12 in Essex, felt they had been given reassurances that they would not face immediate eviction. But on Wednesday, 19 October, the police moved in. Travellers have long complained that they face prejudice and discrimination, but they say the way they have been treated at Dale Farm is unprecedented. ""We are not criminals,"" said Mary Sheridan, who came to Dale Farm with her family eight years ago. ""We have done nothing wrong."" The travellers say they are simply trying to live a traditional way of life. ""We're not asking for much,"" said Kathleen McCarthy. ""We don't want to be millionaires. We just want to live a quiet life."" But the authorities say that the Dale Farm site is illegal and that the travellers have ignored repeated court orders to leave. The eviction, which is expected to take several days, is the largest of its kind in British history. The police have said that they are using ""proportionate and necessary force"" to ensure that the eviction is carried out safely and without violence. But the travellers say that the police are using excessive force. ""They're treating us like we're animals,"" said Mary Sheridan. ""They're trying to scare us into leaving."" The travellers have vowed to stay put. ""We're not going to give up without a fight,"" said Kathleen McCarthy. ""We're going to make them drag us out."" The eviction of Dale Farm is a complex and controversial issue. The travellers say they are being unfairly targeted, while the authorities say they are simply enforcing the law. The outcome of the eviction will have far-reaching implications for the future of traveller communities in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Venezuela ex-prosecutor: I have proof of Maduro corruption,"Luisa Ortega also accused two party leaders and the new prosecutor. Ms Ortega, who fled Venezuela last week after she was sacked and her husband was jailed, claimed that Maduro had created a network of corruption and extortion to line his own pockets. She said he had set up ""frontmen and strawmen"" who had made ""millions of dollars"" from overcharging the state for government contracts and then laundering the money through foreign banks. Ortega said she had evidence to back up her allegations and that she was willing to provide it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. She said she had already spoken to the ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and that she was ""confident"" that the court would open an investigation. The Venezuelan government has dismissed Ortega's allegations as ""baseless"" and ""politically motivated."" Maduro has accused her of being a ""traitor"" and a ""criminal"" who is trying to destabilize the country. Ortega's allegations are likely to further damage Maduro's already fragile credibility. He has been under increasing pressure from both within and outside Venezuela to step down, and his approval ratings have plummeted in recent months. If the ICC does open an investigation into Maduro, it would be a major blow to his presidency and could lead to his eventual downfall. The ICC is a court of last resort that investigates and prosecutes individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Ortega's allegations are likely to be welcomed by the Venezuelan opposition, which has been calling for Maduro to step down for months. The opposition has been struggling to regain momentum in recent months, but Ortega's allegations could give them a new lease of life. The Venezuelan government has accused Ortega of being part of a ""coup attempt"" and has said that she will be arrested if she returns to the country. However, Ortega has said that she is not afraid of being arrested and that she will continue to fight for justice in Venezuela.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tesla's Elon Musk may be in contempt over tweet,"His comments came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the courts to hold him in contempt for violating a settlement aimed at limiting his social media comments. The rule, agreed to by Musk in 2018, requires him to have his tweets pre-approved by a lawyer if they contain information that could affect Tesla's stock price. Musk's defiance is the latest in a series of clashes with the SEC, which has accused him of repeatedly misleading investors. In 2018, Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, causing the company's stock price to spike. The SEC subsequently charged Musk with fraud, and he settled with the agency without admitting or denying wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine. He also agreed to have his tweets pre-approved by a lawyer if they contained information that could affect Tesla's stock price. However, Musk has repeatedly violated the agreement, tweeting about Tesla's production goals, financial performance, and other topics without seeking pre-approval. In September 2022, he tweeted that Tesla would sell ""about 50%"" more cars in 2023 than it did in 2022. The SEC has accused Musk of misleading investors with this tweet, as Tesla's production and delivery numbers have fallen short of his projections. Musk's latest comments come as the SEC is investigating whether he violated the settlement again by tweeting about Tesla's planned stock split. On April 5, 2023, Musk tweeted that Tesla would split its stock in a 3-for-1 ratio. The SEC is now investigating whether Musk had proper approval for this tweet, as it could have affected Tesla's stock price. If the SEC finds that Musk violated the settlement, he could face a range of penalties, including fines, imprisonment, or being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC could also seek to appoint a monitor to oversee Musk's compliance with the settlement. Musk's defiance of the SEC is a sign of his growing frustration with the agency. He has repeatedly accused the SEC of overreach and has said that he does not believe that he needs to comply with its rules. Musk's behavior is likely to further strain his relationship with the SEC and could lead to more legal challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dundee University to tackle hepatitis in Tayside drug users,"Working alongside NHS Tayside, researchers hope to reduce the number of hepatitis C infections by targeting drug users at an early stage. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus which can cause serious liver damage.  The new project at Dundee University will involve running two screening clinics in the city, offering testing to drug users who are not already receiving treatment. The study team will also carry out focus groups and interviews with drug users to understand their knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to hepatitis C. This work will help researchers to develop more effective ways to engage with and support this population. Hepatitis C is a major public health concern in Tayside, with an estimated 1,200 people living with the condition. The virus is spread through contact with infected blood, and can be transmitted through injecting drug use, sharing needles and equipment, or having unprotected sex with an infected person. Around 20% of people with hepatitis C will go on to develop serious liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but treatment can be very effective in preventing the development of serious liver disease. Professor Chris Newman, who is leading the study, said: ""Hepatitis C is a serious condition, but it is one that can be prevented and treated. We know that drug users are at high risk of infection, but many of them are not aware of their status. This project will allow us to reach out to this population and offer them testing and support."" The study is funded by the Medical Research Council and will run for three years. The research team hope that the findings will help to inform future public health policy and improve the care of drug users in Tayside. In addition to the screening clinics, the research team will also be working with local drug services to raise awareness of hepatitis C and to promote testing. They will also be developing new educational resources for drug users and healthcare professionals. The project is part of a wider effort by NHS Tayside to tackle hepatitis C in the region. The health board has already introduced a number of measures to improve testing and treatment for hepatitis C, including offering free testing to all drug users and providing access to new antiviral treatments.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The heartbreak of watching the slow death of ash trees,"At primary school I remember learning how to identify trees by their leaves or bark. The one I was most interested in spotting was the ash, with its distinctive black bark and diamond-shaped leaves. It was the tree we built dens in, climbed to the highest branches, and swung from on long ropes tied to low-hanging limbs. As an adult, I was lucky enough to spend much of my childhood in the countryside, where towering ash trees were everywhere. I would play in woodland, surrounded by their elegant trunks, and marvel at their ability to soar so high into the sky. The ash was a symbol of strength and resilience, a constant in my life. But over the past few years, I have watched with increasing sadness as ash trees have fallen victim to a devastating disease called ash dieback. Caused by a fungus spread by wind and insects, it has decimated ash populations across Europe since it was first identified in the UK in 2012. The fungus infects the leaves of ash trees, causing them to turn brown and die back. In the early stages, the tree may only lose a few leaves, but as the disease progresses, it will spread throughout the canopy, eventually leading to the tree's death. I have seen firsthand the devastation that ash dieback can cause. In one woodland near my home, I have watched as row after row of ash trees have been felled, leaving behind a barren landscape. The once-vibrant green canopy is now a patchwork of brown and grey, and the sound of birdsong has been replaced by an eerie silence. It is not just the loss of the trees themselves that is so heartbreaking. Ash trees are home to a wide variety of wildlife, including insects, birds, and mammals. The loss of these trees will have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, affecting everything from the food chain to the water cycle. I know that there is no easy solution to ash dieback. The fungus is highly contagious, and there is no known cure. However, there is still hope. Scientists are working on developing resistant ash trees, and there are a number of things we can do to slow the spread of the disease. We can avoid moving infected plant material, clean our shoes and equipment after visiting infected areas, and plant new ash trees in areas where they are less likely to be exposed to the fungus. By working together, we can help to protect our ash trees and ensure that they continue to be a part of our landscape for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Criminal injury compensation cuts to be reconsidered,"The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had wanted to restrict payments from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to those suffering serious injuries. But an MoJ spokesman said: ""We recognise the strong feelings about this issue and we want to reassure people that no decisions have been made. We are committed to supporting victims of crime and are looking carefully at all the evidence before making any decisions."" The MoJ's original proposals would have meant that only those who had suffered a ""serious physical or mental injury"" would be eligible for compensation. This would have excluded people who had suffered less serious injuries, such as broken bones or bruising. The proposals were met with widespread criticism from victims' groups and lawyers. They argued that the changes would have left many victims of crime without adequate support. The Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, said: ""These proposals are a betrayal of victims of crime. They would deny compensation to thousands of people who have suffered real harm."" The Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: ""The government's proposals are a retrograde step. They would leave many victims of crime without the financial support they need to rebuild their lives."" The government's decision to reconsider the proposals is a welcome victory for victims' groups. However, it is important to note that no decisions have been made and the MoJ could still decide to implement the changes in the future. In the meantime, victims of crime are advised to continue to apply for compensation under the current scheme. The scheme is open to anyone who has been physically or mentally injured as a result of a crime. To apply for compensation, victims must complete a claim form and submit it to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). The CICA will then assess the claim and decide whether to award compensation. The amount of compensation awarded will depend on the severity of the injuries suffered. The maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded is £500,000. Victims of crime can also claim for loss of earnings, medical expenses, and other expenses. The CICA can also provide support services, such as counselling and therapy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Harry Uzoka death: Three guilty of killing London model,"George Koh, 24, stabbed fellow model Harry Uzoka in the heart after he went to settle the dispute, accompanied by two friends on 11 January last year. Koh, Jonathan Okigbo, 25, and Merse Dikanda, 25, were unanimously found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey on Friday. Uzoka, 25, was killed in Shepherd's Bush, west London, after he intervened in a row between Okigbo and his girlfriend, Blessing Douglas. The court heard that Uzoka and Koh had been friends, but they had fallen out after Koh allegedly made unwanted advances towards Douglas. On the night of the murder, Uzoka went to the flat where the row was taking place with two friends, Elliott Johnson and Adrian Harper. Koh, Okigbo and Dikanda were outside the flat when Uzoka and his friends arrived. A fight broke out, and Koh stabbed Uzoka in the chest. Uzoka was taken to hospital, but he died a short time later. Koh, Okigbo and Dikanda all denied murder, claiming they acted in self-defence. However, the jury rejected their claims and found them guilty of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Eastwood, who led the investigation, said: ""This was a senseless and tragic death of a young man who had his whole life ahead of him. ""Harry Uzoka was a popular and well-respected member of the community, and his death has been a huge loss to his family and friends. ""The defendants have shown no remorse for their actions, and they deserve to spend a long time in prison."" Uzoka's family said in a statement: ""Harry was a kind and loving son, brother and friend. He was taken from us far too soon, and we will never get over his loss. ""We want to thank the police and the CPS for their hard work in bringing the defendants to justice. ""We hope that this verdict will bring some closure to our family and friends, and that Harry's memory will live on.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Meryl Streep: Golden Globes organisers endorse speech,"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) described the actress as a ""class act"" after her speech at the ceremony on Sunday, in which she took aim at US President-elect Donald Trump. The 67-year-old actress, who was honoured with the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, used her acceptance speech to criticise Trump's ""disrespect"" of women. She said: ""Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose."" Her comments were met with a standing ovation from the audience, and have been widely praised by critics. The HFPA, which organises the Golden Globes, said in a statement: ""Meryl Streep's speech was a powerful and moving reminder of the importance of free speech and the role of the press in holding those in power accountable. ""We are proud to have presented her with the Cecil B. DeMille award, and we stand with her in her commitment to fighting for justice and equality."" Streep's speech has been interpreted by some as a direct attack on Trump, who has been accused of making sexist and misogynistic remarks in the past. Trump has not yet responded to Streep's comments, but he has previously dismissed her as an ""over-rated actress"". Streep's speech has been widely praised by celebrities and politicians alike. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted: ""Meryl Streep's speech was powerful and inspiring. Thank you for speaking out for justice and equality."" Actor Mark Ruffalo tweeted: ""Meryl Streep's speech was everything. Brave, passionate, and true. Thank you for being a beacon of light in these dark times."" Streep's speech has also been praised by media organisations.

A Border Force cutter escorted the vessel to Dover, where the people on board were taken into the care of the Home Office. The two boats dealt with by French authorities were intercepted off the coast of Calais. The crossings come as the UK government continues to grapple with the issue of illegal immigration. In 2021, more than 28,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. The government has pledged to take action to reduce the number of crossings, including increasing the number of patrols in the Channel and working with the French authorities to prevent people from leaving French shores. However, charities have warned that the government's approach is not working and that more people are likely to risk their lives crossing the Channel in the coming months. The Refugee Council said: ""These latest crossings are a reminder of the desperate situation facing people who are forced to flee their homes. The government's hostile approach to asylum is not deterring people from crossing the Channel, but it is making their journeys more dangerous."" The Home Office said: ""We are committed to disrupting the activities of organised criminal gangs who are exploiting vulnerable people and putting their lives at risk. We are working closely with the French authorities to tackle this issue and to ensure that those who cross the Channel illegally are returned to France.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"UK 'needs more bureaucrats for Brexit', says ex-diplomat","Sir Simon Fraser was a trade negotiator in Europe and permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office until July 2015. ""I don't think we can avoid an increase in bureaucracy,"" he said, ""because there are more regulations that we will have to manage ourselves in the future that were previously managed at EU level."" The UK will need to recruit thousands more bureaucrats to manage Brexit, according to a former diplomat. Sir Simon Fraser said the UK will need to ""scale up"" its civil service to handle the extra workload created by leaving the EU. The UK is currently negotiating its exit from the EU, and the government has said it will leave the single market and customs union. This will mean that the UK will have to create its own regulations for a range of areas, including trade, immigration, and environmental protection. Fraser said the UK will need to increase the size of its civil service to manage the extra workload. He said the UK will need to recruit ""thousands"" of new bureaucrats, and that the government should start recruiting now. ""I think we need to start planning for this now,"" he said. ""We need to start recruiting and training people now."" The government has said it is committed to reducing the size of the civil service, and has set a target of cutting 91,000 jobs by 2020. However, Fraser said the government will need to make an exception for Brexit. ""I think the government will have to make an exception for Brexit,"" he said. ""This is a one-off event, and we need to make sure that we have the resources in place to manage it."" The government has not said how many new bureaucrats it will need to recruit for Brexit.

Japan PM Abe condemns hostage 'death' video,"Shinzo Abe demanded the release of a second hostage, purported to be Kenji Goto, shown in the video. Japan says it is trying to verify. The prime minister described the apparent killing of Haruna Yukawa as ""an unforgivable act of terrorism, full of despicable brutality"". Abe added: ""Terrorism must never be tolerated and we must do our utmost to bring the terrorists responsible for this act to justice."" The video, released by Islamic State, purports to show the killing of Yukawa. Goto, a 47-year-old journalist, is threatened with a similar fate if demands, including a $200m (£130m) ransom, are not met within 72 hours. Islamic State had previously demanded the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a failed suicide bomber who is currently on death row in Jordan, in exchange for Goto and Yukawa. But Jordan said it would only release Rishawi if the militants provided proof that the Japanese hostages were still alive. US-led coalition aircraft continued to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. A senior coalition official said the strikes were part of a ""deliberate and measured"" campaign to shrink the area under Islamic State control. The official added that the campaign was ""not an effort to destroy or eliminate the group all at once"". Instead, the aim was to ""contain Islamic State, cut off its funding and foreign fighter flow, and support local forces as they take the fight to the terrorists"". The official said the coalition was also working to help Iraqis and Syrians in Islamic State-held areas. This included providing food, water, and medical care, as well as helping people escape from the group's control. It's important to note that the situation is fluid and could change rapidly.

Chinese firm set to buy House of Fraser,"Sanpower is expected to take an 89% share in the company, which would value the business at about £450m. The deal is expected to be announced as early as Tuesday, but a source close to the negotiations said it could slip into Wednesday. It is unclear what the deal means for the future of the business, which employs about 6,000 people in the UK and Ireland. House of Fraser has been struggling in recent years and has announced plans to close 31 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The company has been under pressure from its lenders to find a buyer, and Sanpower is thought to be the only party to have made a formal offer. Sanpower is a Chinese conglomerate with interests in a range of sectors, including retail, property and finance. It is thought to be keen to expand its presence in the UK, and the purchase of House of Fraser would give it a significant foothold in the country's retail sector. However, the deal is likely to raise concerns about the future of House of Fraser's workforce. Sanpower has a history of cost-cutting, and it is thought that it could seek to reduce the number of jobs at House of Fraser in order to improve profitability. The news of the deal comes at a time of uncertainty for the UK retail sector. A number of high-profile retailers have gone into administration in recent months, and the industry is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs and competition from online retailers. It is unclear whether Sanpower's purchase of House of Fraser will be enough to save the business, but it is hoped that the deal will provide some stability and allow the company to focus on its long-term future.

Easyjet wants more women in the cockpit,"By Rebecca Marston Business reporter, BBC News The Amy Johnson initiative, named after the first female pilot to fly solo from the UK to Australia, prompted 1,200 applications from women - a quarter of the total. The airline wants to address the gender imbalance in the industry. Currently, only 5% of the world's commercial airline pilots are women. EasyJet has set a target of recruiting 200 female pilots by 2020. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said: ""We have a problem with gender diversity in our industry... ""We want to inspire the next generation of female pilots."" The airline has also launched its own programme to help women from under-represented backgrounds break into the industry. The scheme, called 'Women in the Cockpit', will provide mentoring, networking opportunities and financial support to women who want to become pilots. EasyJet's initiatives are part of a wider effort by the aviation industry to address the gender imbalance. In 2016, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) launched its 25by2025 campaign, which aims to increase the number of women in the air transport industry by 25% by 2025. The campaign has been endorsed by a number of airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and Delta Air Lines. Despite these efforts, the number of women in the aviation industry remains low. According to IATA, women make up only 2% of airline pilots and 3% of airline engineers. There are a number of reasons for the gender imbalance in the aviation industry. One reason is that women are under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Another reason is that the aviation industry has a long history of being a male-dominated environment. However, there is a growing recognition that the aviation industry needs to change. The industry is losing out on talent by not attracting more women. A more diverse workforce would also lead to a more balanced and inclusive workplace. The initiatives being taken by easyJet and other airlines are a step in the right direction. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender equality in the aviation industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ashya King 'not receiving chemotherapy',"By David Fenton Health correspondent, BBC South Today His father said he did not need it as the tumour was now ""in remission"". But a leading UK cancer expert has said, without chemotherapy, children's chances of survival could be reduced. Ashya King, five, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September 2013. He and his family travelled to Prague for proton beam therapy - a form of radiotherapy - amid a dispute over his treatment with Southampton Children's Hospital. Following the therapy, his father Brett said the tumour was in remission and Ashya would not undergo any further chemotherapy. But Professor Karol Sikora, an independent cancer expert, said not continuing chemotherapy risked a ""significant"" reduction in Ashya's chance of survival. ""We do know that for a brain tumour of this type, the risk of relapse is high - about 60 to 70%,"" he said. ""Therefore without chemotherapy the risk of dying is significantly increased. ""If the family interrupt the treatment, I would think that his chances of survival will be reduced because the most effective treatment for this type of cancer is chemotherapy."" However Ashya's father has defended his decision. Brett King said his son ""did not need"" chemotherapy and said: ""The tumour is in remission. It's gone."" He said the family's decision to refuse chemotherapy was based on ""all the information available"". ""There are various treatments for this particular tumour, some of which include chemotherapy and some of which don't,"" he said. ""All these treatments come with their own toxicities and risks. This treatment has been going on for quite a long time. Ashya's had over six months of treatment. Our family are looking forward to it being over."" Ashya was treated with chemotherapy in Southampton before he left the UK. Professor Sikora said the hospital would have ""sound reasons"" for recommending chemotherapy. ""It's difficult to understand why they have changed their mind,"" he said. ""I think they've been given a lot of incorrect information on the internet... about the potential side-effects of chemotherapy and the benefits of proton beam therapy."" A spokesman for Southampton Children's Hospital said: ""We have a duty of care to all our patients and will therefore continue to take the necessary steps to ensure Ashya receives all the treatment recommended by his doctors.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Google v Oracle: Supreme Court declares Google's code copying fair,"Oracle, another tech titan, had sued Google in 2010 for copyright infringement over what it said was copied computer code. Android is now used in an estimated 70% of the world's smartphones, so even a small percentage of licensing fees would have amounted to billions of dollars. The Supreme Court decision was a victory for Google, but it could have implications for other copyright cases involving software and technology. It could also make it harder for companies to sue each other for copyright infringement. The court's decision was based on a fair use doctrine, which allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. The court found that Google's use of Oracle's code was a fair use because it was transformative, meaning that it created a new and different work that did not compete with Oracle's original work. The court also found that Google's use of Oracle's code was not commercial, even though Android is a commercial product. The court said that Google did not use Oracle's code to make a profit, but rather to create a new and innovative operating system. The Supreme Court's decision is a significant victory for Google and other companies that use copyrighted material in their products. It could make it easier for companies to defend themselves against copyright infringement lawsuits, and it could also lead to more innovation in the technology industry. However, the decision is also likely to be controversial. Some copyright holders may argue that it makes it too easy for companies to use their work without permission. The decision could also lead to more litigation, as companies try to determine what uses of copyrighted material are fair and what uses are not. Despite the potential for controversy, the Supreme Court's decision is a significant development in copyright law. It could have a major impact on the way that companies use copyrighted material in their products, and it could also lead to more innovation in the technology industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sri Lankan rights campaigner Jayalath Jayawardena dies,"By Charles Haviland BBC News, Colombo He had a recent history of heart disease. Dr Jayawardena was a stalwart of the main opposition United National Party. He became well-known for his staunch defence of basic freedoms under both Mr Rajapaksa's presidency and its successor, led by Maithripala Sirisena. Mr Sirisena appointed Dr Jayawardena to head the Human Rights Commission, a role he had held since 2016. However, the government faced criticism for alleged inaction on human rights, and the commission was accused of failing to investigate properly allegations of abuse. In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Dr Jayawardena said: ""The government has appointed me. I'm not accountable to any political party. People can criticise me as much as they want. I have a job to do."" He also argued that Sri Lanka's human rights record had ""vastly improved"" since the end of the war. ""The Rajapaksa regime considered any form of dissent as terrorism - and cracked down heavily. There's been a complete change when you compare that to what happened in the past,"" he said. However, he continued to criticise what he saw as a lack of accountability for war crimes committed during the final stages of the conflict. In 2019, he said that Sri Lanka was not cooperating fully with an international investigation into alleged human rights abuses during the war. Dr Jayawardena was born in Colombo in 1947 and studied in the UK at Oxford University. He worked as an academic and a human rights lawyer before entering politics. He joined the United National Party in 1994 and was elected to parliament two years later. He held several ministerial posts in the governments of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Dr Jayawardena was a strong advocate for a negotiated settlement to the Sri Lankan civil war, which ended in 2009. He also played a key role in the drafting of the country's new constitution, which was passed in 2017. News of Dr Jayawardena's death has been met with an outpouring of grief from across the political spectrum. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said in a statement that Dr Jayawardena had served the country with ""dedication and commitment"". Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said Dr Jayawardena was a ""true champion of human rights"". The UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, said Dr Jayawardena was ""an advocate for human dignity and rights"". ""His principled leadership will be deeply missed,"" she said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Alexander Vindman, witness 'bullied by Trump', quits US military","Lt Col Alexander Vindman was the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president, his lawyer said. Lt Col Vindman's ""concern"" over a phone call between Mr Trump and Ukraine's president led to his removal from his White House role last year and he quit the US military on Wednesday. In a statement his lawyer said he had been subjected to ""false attacks"" and ""innuendo"" since he testified to Congress about the call. He said Lt Col Vindman had ""honourably served this country"" and was ""forced out because he was inconvenient to the president"". The White House has denied the claims. Lt Col Vindman, who was born in Ukraine, was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump. He testified that he had been concerned about the president's request that Ukraine investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. After his testimony, Mr Trump called Lt Col Vindman a ""Never Trumper"" and suggested he had dual loyalties. Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said the president's attacks had taken a toll on his client. ""Lt Col Vindman has been the subject of relentless, unfounded attacks by the President of the United States,"" he said. ""These attacks have caused significant harm to his career and reputation, and have created a hostile work environment for him."" He said Lt Col Vindman had ""honourably served this country"" and was ""forced out because he was inconvenient to the president"". The White House has denied the claims. Lt Col Vindman's resignation comes as Mr Trump is facing a new impeachment inquiry, this time over allegations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden.

Birmingham stabbings: Family tribute to Jacob Billington,"Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street in the early hours of Sunday while he was out with old school friends, police said. He was rushed to hospital but died a short time later. His family spoke of their devastation in a statement released through West Midlands Police. They said: ""We are all absolutely devastated by Jacob's death. He was a loving son, brother, grandson and friend and his life has been cruelly cut short. ""He was out with his friends enjoying himself when he was attacked. We cannot understand why anyone would want to harm him. ""Jacob was a gentle and kind-hearted young man who had his whole life ahead of him. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him."" A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody. Detective Inspector Laura Harrison, from West Midlands Police's homicide unit, said: ""This was a senseless and tragic attack on a young man who was simply enjoying a night out with his friends. ""Our thoughts are with Jacob's family and friends at this difficult time. We are determined to find out who is responsible for his death and bring them to justice."" Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands Police via Live Chat at www.west-midlands.police.uk, via 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Knife crime has been a major issue in Birmingham in recent years. In 2021, there were 12 fatal stabbings in the city, the highest number in a decade. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster, has said that tackling knife crime is a ""top priority"" for the force. He said: ""Knife crime is a scourge on our communities and we are determined to do everything we can to tackle it. ""We are working closely with the police, schools and community groups to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime and to provide support to those who are at risk of being involved in it."" The government has also pledged to take action on knife crime. In 2021, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, announced a £30 million fund to tackle knife crime in six cities, including Birmingham. The fund will be used to provide support for young people who are at risk of being involved in knife crime, and to provide more resources for the police to tackle knife crime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Slovakian 'slave' trafficked to Burnley for marriage,"The Romany victim's account of being handled as a ""human slave"" read like ""something from a 19th century novel by Dickens"", Preston Crown Court heard. She described being trafficked from Slovakia to the UK at the age of 20, under the false promise of a job as a cleaner. Upon arriving in Burnley, she was forced into a sham marriage with a local man, who then subjected her to years of violence and exploitation. The victim testified that she was treated like a ""possession,"" with her movements and communication strictly controlled. She was forced to clean the house, cook the meals, and perform sexual acts on demand. Any attempts to resist were met with severe beatings and threats of violence. ""I was like a prisoner in my own home,"" she told the court. ""I couldn't go anywhere or speak to anyone without his permission. I was terrified of him."" The victim's ordeal only ended when she managed to escape and seek help from the police. Her trafficker, a 37-year-old man from Burnley, was subsequently arrested and charged with modern slavery, rape, and false imprisonment. Prosecutor Lisa Worsley told the court that the case highlighted the ""hidden and insidious"" nature of modern slavery in the UK. She said that victims are often isolated and vulnerable, and may be reluctant to come forward for fear of reprisals. ""This case is a reminder that slavery is not just something that happens in far-off countries,"" she said. ""It can happen anywhere, even in our own communities."" The victim's testimony has had a profound impact on the jury, who have heard harrowing details of her suffering.

UK to Zuckerberg: Show us you're sincere about regulation,"Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJon Twitter But now the UK's information commissioner has asked him to take action to show he means what he says. Elizabeth Denham has told Facebook to drop its appeal against the £500,000 ($655,000) fine she imposed for failing to protect the data of people who used the This is My Digital Life app. She said the public would struggle to trust Facebook's commitment to privacy and transparency if it continued to challenge the fine. ""The ICO [Information Commissioner's Office] wants to see Facebook put its words into action. There needs to be a meaningful shift in Facebook's privacy and data protection practices so that people are empowered and protected,"" she said. ""To create that shift, we expect Facebook to drop its appeal with immediate effect and start engaging meaningfully to bring its practices in line with the law."" So far, Facebook has given no indication that it intends to drop its appeal. In fact, it issued a statement suggesting that it was even less willing to change its privacy policies. The company said that while it shared the ICO's goal to protect people's data, it had ""fundamentally disagreed with the ICO's approach"" to the case. ""We believe the ICO's investigation and decision in this case was flawed, and we intend to appeal,"" it said. ""We appreciate the ICO's recognition that protecting privacy and data is important and share that goal, but we believe the ICO's investigation and decision in this case was flawed and we intend to appeal."" If it does lose the appeal, the company could face a fine of up to 4% of its global turnover - or about £1.5bn. But there are many people who question whether even this would be enough to force the company to change its ways. ""Facebook is an unstoppable juggernaut that is out of control and Mark Zuckerberg will do nothing to change that, no matter how much money he is fined,"" said Julian McQuillan, a security researcher who is now chief executive of security firm Tenable.

Danielle McLaughlin 'raped and strangled' - post mortem,"Danielle McLaughlin, from County Donegal, was found dead in a field close to tourist resorts in Canacona on Tuesday morning. The 28-year-old had travelled to India in February. Her post mortem concluded that brain damage and asphyxia caused her death. A man arrested on Wednesday in connection with the murder of McLaughlin has admitted to having sex with her but denied killing her, his lawyer said. Vikat Bhagat was arrested in the coastal state of Goa after police said that DNA evidence linked him to the crime. McLaughlin's body was found with multiple injuries, including a head wound, and DNA samples were taken from her body. Police said that Bhagat's DNA matched samples taken from her body. Bhagat's lawyer, Amit Palyekar, said that his client admitted to having sex with McLaughlin but denied killing her. He said that Bhagat had been drinking heavily on the night of the murder and could not remember what happened. ""He has admitted to having consensual sex with the girl,"" Palyekar said. ""He does not remember what happened after that because he was heavily drunk."" Palyekar said that Bhagat had been cooperating with police and had given them a DNA sample. He said that his client was ""innocent until proven guilty"" and that he would fight the charges against him. The murder of McLaughlin has shocked the local community in Goa and has raised concerns about the safety of foreign tourists in the state. Goa is a popular tourist destination, known for its beaches and nightlife. McLaughlin's family has said that they are ""devastated"" by her death and have called for justice. They have said that they want the person responsible for her murder to be brought to justice. The Irish government has said that it is ""deeply concerned"" about the murder of McLaughlin and has called on the Indian government to investigate the case thoroughly.

"UK fracking: Shale gas starts flowing, Cuadrilla says","Operations began at the Lancashire site in October for the first time since 2011 when it was suspended because of earth tremors. Cuadrilla said that the gas that was produced will be flared off on site rather than sold commercially. The firm said this was ""to ensure both operational efficiency and to provide technical information"". It said the gas was expected to flow for about four weeks. Cuadrilla is the only company to have fracked in the UK, but was forced to suspend its operations in 2011 and 2019 after seismic activity was recorded. Fracking - a technique to extract gas or oil from underground - has been a source of controversy in the UK, with many environmental groups opposed to the process. Critics say it can cause environmental damage, including water contamination and air pollution. They also argue that it is not a sustainable source of energy because it contributes to climate change. The government has said fracking will only be allowed if it can be done safely, but has not ruled out supporting the industry in the future. Cuadrilla has always maintained that fracking is safe and can be done without causing environmental harm. The company said in a statement that it was ""delighted"" to have started producing gas from the Lancashire site. ""This is a significant milestone for Cuadrilla and for the UK shale gas industry,"" the statement said. ""We are now focused on continuing to operate safely and efficiently, and on providing valuable technical information that will help to inform the wider debate about shale gas in the UK."" Anti-fracking campaigners have vowed to continue to oppose the industry. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Danny Gross said: ""This is a dangerous and unnecessary step backwards. Fracking is a dirty and risky technique that has no place in the UK. ""The government must now abandon its support for fracking and focus on investing in clean, renewable energy sources.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Tax power restrictions 'starting point' for debate, says Cameron","UK ministers want to hold a referendum on allowing the Welsh government to vary income tax rates. Each income tax band could only be moved at the same time and by the same amount. For example, if the basic rate of income tax in Wales is 10%, the government could increase or decrease it by 1%, 2%, or any other single figure - but not by different amounts for different bands. Under the plans, the Welsh government would not be able to set a different threshold at which people start paying income tax. Many people have said they would support the move if it was put to a referendum. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, said it would support a referendum on giving the Welsh government the power to set income tax. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, said: ""I think the people of Wales are grown up and have shown in recent referendums that they are capable of taking big decisions."" The Welsh Conservatives have also said they would support the move. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""This is something that we have been calling for for a long time. We believe that the people of Wales should have the power to set their own taxes."" However, some people have said they are concerned about the impact that the move could have on the UK's economy. The UK Treasury has said that it is concerned about the impact that the move could have on the UK's single market. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We are concerned about the potential impact on the UK's single market, and on the competitiveness of the UK economy."" The Welsh government has said that it is confident that the move would not have a negative impact on the UK economy.

Tesco to fight dairy price-fixing fine from OFT,"The supermarket giant was one of nine firms facing penalties totalling close to £50m for colluding over the price of milk and cheese in 2002 and 2003. But Tesco expressed ""surprise and dismay"" at the findings, saying it ""fundamentally disagrees"" with the decision and intends to appeal. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) accused Tesco of discussing and agreeing price increases with other UK supermarkets, including Asda, Sainsbury's and Safeway. The investigation focused on price discussions that took place at a series of meetings that were allegedly organised by former dairy industry executive Robert Wiseman. The OFT said the meetings ""created a climate in which it was easier for the supermarkets to implement the price increases, and to deter customers from switching between the supermarkets"". The investigation also found that the supermarkets exchanged commercially sensitive information, such as details of their pricing plans. The OFT imposed fines totalling £49.5m on the nine companies involved. Tesco was fined £10.3m, the largest penalty. Other companies fined included Dairy Crest (£8.7m), Arla Foods (£6.3m) and Lactalis Nestle (£3.9m). Tesco said it ""acted in the best interests of customers"" and that it ""did not engage in any anti-competitive behaviour"". The company said it would ""vigorously defend"" its position in court. The other eight companies fined by the OFT have not yet commented on the decision. The OFT's investigation into dairy price-fixing is not the first time that the supermarket industry has been accused of anti-competitive behaviour. In 2002, the Competition Commission found that the four major UK supermarkets were operating a cartel in relation to the supply of fuel. The Competition Commission imposed fines totalling £252m on the four companies. The OFT's dairy price-fixing investigation is a reminder of the importance of competition in the food industry. Competition helps to keep prices low and encourages innovation. The OFT's findings suggest that the UK supermarket industry is not as competitive as it could be. The OFT's investigation may lead to changes in the way that supermarkets operate, which could benefit consumers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Google's Street View faces multi-state US probe,"It is the latest in a series of global investigations aimed at the firm. Google has admitted that its Street View cars ""accidentally"" collected data from unsecured wi-fi networks in 30 countries because of some rogue code in the company's software. The probes are looking into whether the data collection breached privacy laws and whether the company misled regulators. In the US, the investigation is being led by the attorneys general of seven states: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. They have asked Google to provide a range of documents, including records about the data collection process, the security measures that were in place and the communications between Google and its employees about the issue. Germany has already fined Google €145,000 (£107,000; $161,000) over the issue. The city of Hamburg has also banned Street View cars from operating in the area because of concerns about privacy. In June, Google agreed to pay £18m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by UK citizens over the Street View data collection. The company has since taken steps to tighten its privacy controls and has said that it is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. However, the latest investigations show that regulators are still concerned about the company's data collection practices. The probes are likely to take several months to complete. If any of the states find that Google has breached the law, they could impose fines or other penalties. Google has said that it is cooperating with the investigations and that it is confident that it has not broken any laws. However, the investigations could damage the company's reputation and make it harder to convince people to share their personal information with Google. The probes also come at a time when Google is facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. The European Commission is investigating Google's search practices, while the US Federal Trade Commission is looking into the company's advertising practices. The investigations show that regulators are increasingly concerned about the power of large technology companies and their ability to collect and use personal data.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sellafield partly closed after 'above normal' radiation,"Each building was checked after a perimeter alarm was triggered at the north of the site. The company later said it was naturally occurring background radiation and not a nuclear leak. A spokesman added: ""Our priority is the safety of our workforce and the protection of the environment. We take all radiation alarms seriously and investigate them thoroughly. ""We are confident that there has been no release of radioactive material from the site."" The alarm was triggered at around 08:30 BST on Saturday. The site was partly closed as a precaution, with only essential staff allowed on the northern part of the site. The Environment Agency said it was monitoring the situation and had no concerns about any impact on the public or the environment. Sellafield is one of the UK's most hazardous nuclear sites. It is home to a number of nuclear reactors and reprocessing facilities. In 2005, a major fire broke out at the site, which led to the release of radioactive material. The fire caused widespread public concern and led to a number of investigations. The site has been subject to a number of safety upgrades since the fire, including the installation of new fire detection and suppression systems. The latest incident is a reminder of the potential risks associated with nuclear power. However, Sellafield's operator, Sellafield Ltd, said it was confident that the site was safe. A spokesman said: ""We have a robust safety culture and we are committed to operating the site safely and securely.""

Tamboran: Licence for fracking plans terminated,"Tamboran was granted a petroleum licence in 2011. It had three years to inform the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on its work programme and drilling schedule. Tamboran was unable to do this in the agreed timescale. DETI subsequently served several late submission notices on the company. In a statement, Tamboran Resources UK Ltd said that while the company ""fundamentally disagrees with the decision"" it would ""comply fully"" with the government's decision. The company said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision as it had submitted ""a robust plan to undertake exploration drilling"". ""The company believes that the proposed exploration drilling programme would have been in accordance with the terms of the licence and Northern Ireland legislation and would have been carried out safely and responsibly,"" the statement continued. Tamboran also said that it had ""confidence in the safety and regulation of onshore oil and gas exploration and drilling in the UK"". In a statement, DETI said that the licence had been terminated ""in accordance with the relevant legislation and after careful consideration of all available information"". The department said that it ""recognises the potential economic benefits of oil and gas exploration and production in Northern Ireland"". However, it added that ""the safety of our environment and the wellbeing of our communities must be paramount"". DETI said it would ""continue to engage with stakeholders on the future of onshore oil and gas exploration and production in Northern Ireland"". The decision to terminate Tamboran's licence is likely to be welcomed by environmental groups. Friends of the Earth Northern Ireland said that the decision was a ""victory for common sense and the environment"". ""This decision sends a clear message that fracking will not be tolerated in Northern Ireland,"" the group said in a statement. Greenpeace also welcomed the decision, saying that it was a ""major victory for the people of Northern Ireland"". ""This decision is a testament to the power of people power,"" the group said in a statement. The decision is also likely to be welcomed by some local residents. Many people in the area where Tamboran was planning to drill have expressed concerns about the potential impact of fracking on their health and the environment. A petition against fracking in Northern Ireland has been signed by more than 50,000 people.

"North Korea access to outside media up, says US study","The government was unable to maintain a ""total monopoly"" over information and the people's ""understanding of the world is changing"", the report by InterMedia, a Washington-based research group, concluded. The report found that access to outside information in North Korea has increased significantly over the last few years, thanks to the widespread use of mobile phones and USB flash drives. This has opened up a new window to the outside world for North Koreans, who are now able to access a wider range of information than ever before. The report found that the North Korean government is aware of the increasing access to outside information and is trying to crack down on it. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful, and access to outside information continues to grow. The report's findings are based on a survey of North Korean defectors who have recently arrived in South Korea. The defectors were asked about their access to outside information, and their responses were used to estimate the overall level of access to outside information in North Korea. The report's findings are significant because they suggest that the North Korean government is losing its grip on the information environment. This is a major development, and it could have a profound impact on the future of North Korea. If the North Korean people continue to gain access to outside information, they will become more aware of the outside world and the possibilities that exist beyond their borders. This could lead to a growing demand for change, and it could eventually lead to the downfall of the North Korean government. The report's findings are a reminder that the world is changing, and that even the most repressive regimes cannot completely control the flow of information. The North Korean government may be able to block access to certain websites and social media platforms, but it cannot stop the flow of information altogether. The North Korean people are now more connected to the outside world than ever before, and this is having a profound impact on their lives. They are becoming more aware of the outside world and the possibilities that exist beyond their borders. This could lead to a growing demand for change, and it could eventually lead to the downfall of the North Korean government.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Windrush scandal: Compensation could be capped under proposed scheme,"Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high amount"" compared to others who had been wronged. The department also insisted it planned to make the scheme ""as simple and straightforward as possible"". However, while the Home Office has proposed a minimum payment of £10,000 for each person who was unlawfully detained or deported, the proposed maximum compensation is yet to be set. Campaigners have said that a cap of £100,000 would not be acceptable as many people had lost much more than that as a result of the scandal. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, described the consultation as ""a complete insult to the victims"". ""The Windrush scandal is one of the most shameful episodes in recent British history and the victims deserve much more than what is being offered,"" she said. ""A cap of £100,000 is completely inadequate. Many victims have lost their jobs, their homes, and their health as a result of this scandal. They deserve to be properly compensated."" The Windrush generation refers to people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971 to help rebuild the country after World War Two. Many were children at the time and had no idea they did not have the right documentation to be in the UK. The scandal erupted in 2018 when it emerged that some members of the Windrush generation had been wrongly detained and deported, while others had been denied access to healthcare and benefits. The government has since apologized for the scandal and set up a compensation scheme. However, the details of the scheme have been criticized by campaigners who say it does not go far enough. The Home Office said the consultation would give victims and their representatives the opportunity to have their say on the design of the scheme.

Greene King Black Boy pubs renamed in 'anti-racist' move,"Greene King has changed the names of three pubs called The Black Boy, and another called The Black's Head. Managing director Wayne Shurvinton said there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism"". The pubs have been renamed The Black Horse, The White Hart, The Coach and Horses, and The Duck. Shurvinton said the decision was made after ""listening to feedback from our customers and local communities"". He added: ""We want our pubs to be welcoming and inclusive spaces where everyone can enjoy themselves. We believe that changing the names of these pubs is an important step in making that happen."" The move comes amid a wider debate about the use of racially insensitive language and imagery in the UK. In recent months, several statues of historical figures with links to slavery have been toppled or removed. Greene King's decision has been welcomed by some anti-racism campaigners. ""This is a positive step forward,"" said Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote. ""The names of these pubs were offensive and had no place in our society. Changing them is a sign that we are moving in the right direction."" However, others have expressed concerns about the move. ""This is a knee-jerk reaction to a very small minority of people who are trying to rewrite history,"" said historian David Starkey. ""The names of these pubs have been around for centuries and they do not have any racist connotations."" Greene King is one of the largest pub chains in the UK, with over 2,700 pubs. The company has said that it will continue to review the names of its pubs and make changes where necessary. In addition to the four pubs that have been renamed, Greene King also plans to change the name of a pub called The Black Boy in Nottingham. The company has said that it will work with local historians to find a new name for the pub that is ""appropriate and respectful"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"France: More than 2,500 break virus restrictions at illegal rave","Some of the 2,500 ravers in Lieuron near Rennes in Brittany had planned to party until Tuesday. Police issued fines to revellers found leaving and the organisers were being identified as the party ended. Around 1,500 police officers had been deployed to disperse the crowds, with reinforcements from as far away as Paris and other cities. They used drones, tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to break up the party. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the illegal rave was a ""serious threat to public order"" and that the police had acted ""firmly but fairly"". He said that the party had been planned for weeks and that the organisers had expected up to 5,000 people to attend. The rave was held in a field near a small town, with stages and sound systems set up for the revellers. The party-goers were mostly young people, many of them from the Paris region. The illegal rave in Lieuron is the latest in a series of similar events that have taken place in France in recent months. In June, a rave in the north-eastern city of Metz was attended by over 3,000 people and lasted for several days. The French government has condemned these illegal raves and vowed to crack down on them. In July, the government announced new measures to prevent and punish illegal raves, including increased fines and prison sentences for organisers. However, some rave organisers say that the government's crackdown is unfair and that they are simply providing a space for young people to express themselves and have fun. They say that the government should focus on providing more legal and safe places for young people to party. The debate over illegal raves is likely to continue in France, as the government tries to balance the need to maintain public order with the right of young people to enjoy themselves.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cardiff Airport to get loan fund of up to £13m to attract new airlines,"The first £3.5m of the loan, from the Welsh government, will be drawn down by the airport next year. Welsh ministers have described the loan as the most significant step since they bought the airport 18 months ago. The rest of the money will come from commercial lenders. The airport hopes to use the loan to attract new airlines and increase passenger numbers. Cardiff Airport has been struggling in recent years, with passenger numbers falling. The airport has been losing money and has had to cut staff. The Welsh government hopes that the loan will help to turn around the airport's fortunes. The government believes that the airport is vital to the Welsh economy. The loan will be used to fund a number of projects at the airport, including: A new terminal building A new runway A new control tower A new baggage handling system A new car park The airport is also planning to launch a new marketing campaign to attract new airlines. The Welsh government has said that it is confident that the loan will be a success. The government believes that the airport has the potential to be a major economic driver for Wales.

HIV flushed out by cancer drug,"By James Gallagher Health and science reporter, BBC News website The cornerstone of treatment, anti-retroviral therapy, kills the virus in the bloodstream but leaves ""HIV reservoirs"" untouched. The study, published in PLoS Pathogens, showed the drug Vorinostat flushed out some of these reservoirs in the blood. Researchers say it is still early days, but this suggests a combination of cancer and HIV treatments could one day lead to a cure. HIV has a unique ability to evade the immune system - it hides its genetic material inside the DNA of immune cells. When an immune cell is activated to fight an infection, the latent HIV emerges to produce new virus particles. Finding and destroying these reservoirs is crucial for a cure for HIV. Dr Paul Bieniasz, from the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, who led the study, said: ""Most people believe that HIV cannot be cured with current therapies because of these latent reservoirs. ""And because they are latent, they don't present a target to the immune system or to anti-retroviral therapy."" His team treated HIV-infected human cells with Vorinostat for four days. Most of the virus remained hidden, but some of the dormant HIV was exposed. ""It's only a modest effect,"" he said. ""But it's an important proof-of-concept study that this type of approach might have promise."" Dr Bieniasz said the next step would be to see if the drug has the same effect in animal models of HIV. And he said it was possible HIV-infected people who needed Vorinostat for their cancer could benefit from this side-effect. Dr Sarah Fidler, a HIV cure researcher at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were ""an interesting proof-of-concept"". She said: ""If this strategy could be translated to HIV patients, it could be used either to reduce reservoirs at the start of treatment to enhance standard therapy, as a strategy to eliminate reservoirs after the virus has been reduced to very low levels, or to enhance immune-based strategies where the aim is to kill infected cells."" She added: ""There will still be challenges to overcome, such as trying to identify the right time to administer the drug, and considering the side-effects or interactions with HIV drugs or treatments for other conditions.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts,"Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts The Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd was taken over by a limited company and charity after it closed in 2014. A statement on its Facebook page said it closed its doors on Saturday. A post on its social media page said: ""It is with great sadness that we have to announce the closure of The Muni Arts Centre. ""As a board of trustees and staff, we have worked tirelessly in recent years to address these significant financial challenges and have been exploring all possible options to keep the centre open. ""However, despite these efforts, we have been unable to secure the funding necessary to continue operating the venue and have had to take the difficult decision to close."" The Muni Arts Centre was built in 1910 as a public library and became a popular venue for music, theatre and dance in the 1970s and 1980s. The centre played a key role in the cultural life of Pontypridd, but it closed in 2014 due to financial difficulties. The Muni Arts Centre was taken over by a limited company and charity in 2015. The new owners had hoped to reopen the centre in 2016 but were unable to secure the necessary funding. The closure of the Muni Arts Centre is a major blow to the cultural life of Pontypridd. The venue played an important role in the community, providing a space for people to enjoy music, theatre and dance.

Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis' death 'caused by heading balls',"Alan Jarvis played for Everton and Hull City in the 1960s and 1970s, winning three caps for his country. The 76-year-old, who died in March, was diagnosed with dementia in 2016. A coroner ruled that heading footballs during his playing days ""more than likely"" caused the brain damage which led to Jarvis developing the condition. Professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than the general population and there is a growing concern about the long-term effects of heading the ball. Experts believe it could be linked to the repetitive heading of the ball causing small amounts of trauma to the brain. However, they say more research is needed to establish a definitive link between the two. The Football Association (FA) said it was ""committed to improving the understanding of the long-term health of former players"" and was funding research into the issue. In a statement, the FA said: ""The FA is committed to improving the understanding of the long-term health of former players and is funding research into the issue. ""We are aware of the concerns that have been raised about the potential risks of heading the ball and are committed to working with other organisations to help protect players."" The FA has introduced a number of measures to try to reduce the risk of heading the ball, including limiting the number of headers that players can do in training and introducing a ban on heading for children under the age of 12. It is hoped that these measures will help to protect future generations of players from the risk of developing dementia. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the long-term effects of heading the ball. More research is needed to establish a definitive link between the two and to determine whether the measures that are being introduced are effective in reducing the risk of dementia.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Australian casino shares tumble after China arrests,"Crown Resorts, controlled by James Packer, closed 13.9% lower after Crown confirmed 18 of its staff had been detained in China. Among those arrested was a senior executive in charge of international high-roller operations, Jason O'Connor. Crown said the arrests were related to an investigation by Chinese authorities into ""an alleged offence of promoting gambling"". The company said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the arrests and was providing consular support to its staff. The arrests come at a time when the Chinese government is cracking down on gambling and money laundering. In recent months, Chinese authorities have detained several executives from other casino operators, including Star Entertainment Group and the former head of Macau's gaming regulator, Alvin Chau. Analysts said the arrests could have a significant impact on Crown's business in China. Crown generates around 20% of its revenue from China, and it has been investing heavily in the country in recent years. ""The arrests are a major blow to Crown's China ambitions,"" said David Bain, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""Crown has been targeting high-rollers from China, and these arrests will make it much more difficult for the company to attract these customers."" The arrests also come at a time when Crown is facing other challenges. The company is currently under investigation by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) for alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Crown is also facing a class action lawsuit from shareholders who allege that the company misled them about its compliance with anti-money laundering laws. The combination of these challenges has put pressure on Crown's share price. Crown's shares have fallen by more than 30% in the past year. Analysts said the arrests in China could further damage Crown's share price. ""The arrests could lead to a sell-off in Crown shares, as investors become increasingly concerned about the company's exposure to China,"" said Bain.

Google hit with €1.5bn fine from EU over advertising,"It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. Google has previously faced EU antitrust fines of €2.4bn in 2017 and €4.3bn in 2018. The company said it would appeal the latest fine. ""We will appeal this decision,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""The decision ignores our investments in Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" The European Commission said Google's conduct had ""denied consumers a genuine choice of mobile search apps and services and stifled innovation in the mobile advertising market"". ""Google has cemented its dominance in general search in the vast majority of member states through various practices,"" commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. ""It has also used Android as a vehicle to consolidate its dominance in search via mobile devices."" Vestager said the fine was ""proportionate and dissuasive"". The case relates to agreements between Google and mobile network operators and device manufacturers. The commission said the agreements included clauses that required the pre-installation of Google's search app on Android devices and prevented manufacturers from developing and distributing competing apps. The commission said Google also prevented rivals from accessing key information needed to develop competing search apps. Google denied the allegations, arguing that its agreements with partners were ""pro-competitive"". The company said its partners were free to choose any search provider they wanted. Google also pointed to the large number of competing search apps available on Android devices.

Wales child abuse: 38 calls to children's commissioner,"Keith Towler said some were from people wanting to make ""fresh allegations"", and he would welcome further calls. Details of abuse, centred on children's homes in north Wales, began to emerge in the 1990s leading to the Clwyd inquiry, which reported in 2002. A later inquiry, the Waterhouse inquiry, reported in 2000 on allegations of abuse in children's homes in north Wales. Mr Towler said an inquiry must be independent and explore all aspects of child abuse, but he said a narrow inquiry may not be the best approach. He said: ""I feel very strongly that we should be talking about a broader inquiry and we should not be excluding, for example, the churches, [or] local authorities."" He was also asked if abuse continues to this day, and he replied: ""I cannot say for sure because I haven't got the information available to me. But what I would say is that there is a danger that there are still some people who are working with children who shouldn't be."" A statement from the Welsh government said: ""The First Minister has asked the Children and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales (CSSIW) to complete a review of safeguarding and governance around residential child care in north Wales by the end of the financial year. ""The CSSIW will also be asked to look into ways to improve reporting across organisations and agencies on safeguarding matters, including the role of the commissioner for children."" In a statement, the Commissioner for Children for Wales said child sexual abuse is a ""scourge on society"" and that the individuals involved should be ""thoroughly investigated"". The commissioner said: ""We need to take action now to protect children and young people from further abuse.

""It's a period in history I'm very intrigued by,"" said Pine. ""I think historically Robert the Bruce was one of the greatest warriors and greatest heroes of Scotland. ""His story is one of rebellion and kind of triumph over tyranny and I think is still such a moving and exciting story today."" Pine said he was attracted to the role as it allowed him to explore the idea of heroism. ""I always like to think that heroism isn't just about the individual,"" he said. ""It's about a community coming together. The sum of all the parts creates a heroic whole."" He added: ""There are so many different kinds of heroes, from those who stand up for what they believe in to those who are just trying to make a better life for their family.

Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam',"By Chris Baraniuk Technology reporter In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" that led to the theft of £79 million. An investigation by the BBC has discovered that the targets of the attack were Google and Facebook's parent company, Meta. The attack saw the fraudster pose as a representative of a Taiwanese hardware manufacturer and send emails to staff at Meta and Google. The emails contained links to a malicious website that looked like a genuine login page for the companies' email systems. Staff at Meta and Google were tricked into entering their usernames and passwords into this fake website. The fraudster then used this information to log in to Meta and Google's email systems and send out requests for payments to fraudulent bank accounts. In some cases, the fraudster also used the compromised email accounts to send out phishing emails to the companies' customers, in an attempt to steal their personal data. Meta and Google have not publicly confirmed that they were the targets of this attack, but a source close to the investigation has confirmed the BBC's findings. The attack is a reminder of the importance of being vigilant against phishing attacks. Phishing emails often look very genuine, but there are some tell-tale signs to watch out for. For example, phishing emails often: - Use generic greetings, such as ""Dear Valued Customer"" or ""Dear Sir/Madam"". - Contain spelling and grammar errors. - Ask you to click on a link to a website that you don't recognise. - Ask you to enter your personal information, such as your username, password, or credit card number. If you receive an email that you think may be a phishing email, do not click on any links or open any attachments. Forward the email to your company's IT department or to a dedicated phishing reporting service. You can also report phishing emails to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at report@phishing.gov.uk.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
US Senate passes sanctions on Iran central bank,"The measures, passed by 100 votes to nil, would ban foreign firms from doing business with the Iranian central bank. Before it can become law, it must be approved by the House and President. The bill's supporters say it will cripple Iran's economy and force it to abandon its nuclear programme. However, critics argue that it will only harm the Iranian people and make it more difficult to resolve the nuclear issue through diplomacy. The Obama administration has not yet said whether it will support the bill. However, it has previously warned that new sanctions could make it more difficult to resolve the nuclear issue through diplomacy. The US and Iran have been locked in a standoff over Iran's nuclear programme for years. Iran insists that its programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US and its allies believe that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. In 2015, Iran and six world powers, including the US, reached a deal to limit Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. However, President Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Since then, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated. In January 2020, the US assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to retaliate by firing missiles at US forces in Iraq. The US has also imposed additional sanctions on Iran in an attempt to cripple its economy. However, Iran has refused to abandon its nuclear programme, and the standoff continues. The passage of the new sanctions bill by the US Senate is a further escalation of tensions between the two countries. It remains to be seen whether the bill will be approved by the House and the President, and whether it will have any impact on the nuclear standoff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UK ministers halt Scottish fracking ahead of Holyrood move,"UK ministers will, however, consult with companies which have already applied for licences before any final decision is made. New powers over the industry are due to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament in the coming months. Scottish ministers have welcomed the announcement, saying it provides ""certainty"" for communities and businesses. ""The Scottish Government has always been clear that we do not support fracking, and we are pleased that the UK Government has listened to our concerns,"" said a Scottish Government spokesperson. ""We will now work with the UK Government to ensure that the transition to a net-zero economy is fair and just for all."" The decision to halt fracking in Scotland has been met with mixed reactions from the industry. Some companies have welcomed the move, saying it provides clarity and certainty for their operations. Others have expressed disappointment, saying they believe fracking could have played a role in reducing the UK's reliance on foreign energy imports. The UK Government's decision to halt fracking in Scotland is a significant development in the debate over the future of the industry in the UK. It is likely to lead to increased pressure on the government to ban fracking in England and Wales. Fracking is a controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from shale rock. It involves drilling a well into the rock and then injecting water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure to fracture the rock and release the oil or gas. There are concerns that fracking can cause environmental damage, including water contamination and air pollution. There are also concerns that it can cause earthquakes. The Scottish Government has a long-standing opposition to fracking, and in 2015 it introduced a moratorium on the practice. The UK Government has previously supported fracking, but in recent months it has come under increasing pressure to ban the practice. The decision to halt fracking in Scotland is a major victory for environmental campaigners.

Hepatitis C vaccine: Oxford researchers' trial 'promising',"Designing a vaccine has been difficult as the virus changes its appearance, making it hard to find something to target. Writing in Science Translational Medicine, researchers say their vaccine targets all major strains of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The vaccine is made using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) – harmless viruses that can deliver genetic material into cells. It delivers genes encoding non-structural proteins (NS) of HCV, which are essential for viral replication and not targeted by current direct-acting antiviral drugs. They tested the vaccine in mice with liver disease and found that it produced high levels of antibodies and reduced levels of viral RNA in the liver. The findings were consistent across all strains of HCV tested, suggesting it could provide broad protection against the virus. They then tested the vaccine in non-human primates and found that it was safe and induced robust antibody responses. Dr Rebecca Spindler, of the University of Oxford, said: ""These results are very promising and suggest that this vaccine strategy could be used to prevent or treat HCV infection. We are now planning to start clinical trials in humans."" Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus that can cause liver damage, scarring and liver cancer. It is estimated to affect around 71 million people worldwide. The current standard of care for HCV is direct-acting antiviral drugs, which are highly effective at clearing the virus but can be expensive and have side effects. A vaccine would be a more cost-effective and convenient way to prevent HCV infection. The new vaccine is still in the early stages of development, but the results from the animal studies are promising. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective in humans, it could have a major impact on the global burden of HCV. In addition to developing a vaccine, researchers are also working on new treatments for HCV. One promising approach is gene editing, which could be used to cure the virus by removing it from the body. Clinical trials of gene editing for HCV are currently underway.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Her detention sparked international concern, with the US and the UN calling for her immediate release. Amnesty International said the charges against her were ""baseless"" and politically motivated. Gao has been a thorn in the side of the Chinese government for many years. In 1989, she was imprisoned for her reporting on the Tiananmen Square protests. After her release, she continued to write and comment on China's political system. In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on dissent, and Gao's imprisonment is seen as a further sign of this. Chinese state media has accused Gao of betraying her country and endangering national security. However, many believe that she is being punished for her independent journalism and her criticism of the government. The case has also raised concerns about the freedom of the press in China. In recent years, several other journalists have been detained or imprisoned for their work. In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Gao's imprisonment. The club said that ""the detention of Gao Yu is a clear signal that the Chinese government is determined to silence independent journalism"". The Chinese government has not commented on the international criticism of Gao's imprisonment. However, it is clear that the government is determined to crack down on dissent and to maintain its control over the media.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nearly 200 Wales carers 'had to give up jobs' to look after family,"By India Pollock BBC Wales social affairs correspondent Carers Wales found the figure amounted to just under half of the people it surveyed.

Chief executive of Carers Wales, Elaine Bennett, said: ""The research shows the huge impact that caring can have on people's lives. ""Many people are having to give up work or reduce their hours in order to care for a loved one. This can have a significant financial impact on families, as well as making it difficult for people to progress in their careers. ""We want to see the Welsh Government do more to support unpaid carers. This could include providing more financial assistance, more respite care, and more flexible working arrangements."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We know that unpaid carers make a huge contribution to our communities, and we are committed to supporting them. ""We provide a range of support to carers, including financial assistance, respite care, and information and advice. We are also working to improve the flexibility of working arrangements for carers.

Jack and Sophie most popular baby names in Scotland,"Other favourites for babies born in 2010 included Lewis for boys and Olivia for girls. The details, released by the Registrar General for Scotland, also showed Oliver and Jamie as new entrants in the top 10. ""This information is fascinating as it provides valuable insights into current trends and gives us a glimpse into what people are choosing to name their children,"" a spokesperson from the Registrar General for Scotland commented. Additionally, Noah, Elijah, Charlie, and Oscar continued to hold their places in the top 10 list of boys' names. Meanwhile, Isabella, Emily, Ava, and Isla remained consistent favourites for girls. The report also revealed that some traditional names have experienced a resurgence in popularity, such as Lachlan, which moved up 20 places in the rankings. Eilidh, a classic Gaelic name, also saw a surge in popularity, jumping from 15th to 10th place. The data also suggests that parents are increasingly opting for shorter, simpler names. Max, Jack, and Josh have become more common for boys, while Isla, Ava, and Mia have gained popularity among girls. The choice of baby names can be influenced by various factors, including personal preferences, cultural heritage, and even celebrity influences. It is interesting to observe how these trends evolve over time, reflecting the changing cultural landscape and societal values.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Regulator to investigate sale of online dating profiles,"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has said it will investigate the sale. The ICO said the sale of this information could be ""a significant personal data breach"". The regulator said it had become aware of claims that personal data from online dating profiles is being sold on the internet. The ICO said it was concerned that this data could be used for ""fraudulent or malicious"" purposes. ""The sale of personal data from online dating profiles could be a significant personal data breach,"" the ICO said in a statement. ""We are aware of these claims and we will be investigating them thoroughly."" The ICO said it was not yet clear how many people had been affected by the sale of their data. The regulator said it was working to establish the full extent of the breach. ""We will be working with the relevant organisations to establish the full extent of this breach and to take appropriate action,"" the ICO said. The ICO's investigation comes after a report by The Sunday Times newspaper claimed that the personal data of millions of people who have used online dating websites had been sold on the internet. The newspaper said the data included names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The report claimed that the data had been sold to a number of companies, including a company called Cybersitter. Cybersitter has denied any wrongdoing. The ICO said it was aware of the report in The Sunday Times and was taking it ""very seriously"". The regulator said it would be working with the relevant organisations to establish the full extent of the breach and to take appropriate action. The ICO's investigation is likely to focus on whether the companies involved in the sale of the data have breached the Data Protection Act 1998. The Act requires companies to take reasonable steps to protect the personal data they hold. If the ICO finds that the companies involved in the sale of the data have breached the Data Protection Act, it could take a number of enforcement actions, including issuing fines. The ICO's investigation is a reminder of the importance of protecting your personal data. When you provide your personal data to a company, you should make sure that you are confident that the company will take steps to protect your data.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Fewer cars' as London congestion charge zone cut back,"TfL said in the first three months of the year there was also a negligible impact on air quality and minimal change in traffic speeds in the area. The organisation said that overall, the ULEZ had not affected journey times for motorists, with many finding alternative routes or using public transport instead. However, some businesses in the affected areas have reported a drop in trade since the ULEZ was extended. A spokesperson for the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the expansion of the zone had been ""a blow"" to many small businesses, particularly those that rely on customers driving to their premises. ""We have heard from members who have seen a significant drop in footfall since the ULEZ was extended,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is particularly concerning for businesses that are already struggling in the current economic climate."" The spokesperson added that the chamber was calling on the Mayor of London to review the ULEZ and consider exemptions for certain types of businesses. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has defended the ULEZ, saying that it is necessary to improve air quality in the capital. He has also pointed to the fact that the ULEZ has been accompanied by a number of measures to support businesses, such as grants for electric vehicles and discounts on public transport. ""The ULEZ is essential to protect the health of Londoners and reduce air pollution,"" Khan said. ""We have provided support for businesses to help them adapt, and we will continue to work with them to ensure that they can continue to thrive."" The ULEZ is part of a wider strategy to improve air quality in London. Other measures include the introduction of a low-emission zone for buses and coaches, and the promotion of walking and cycling.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid in Scotland: 'Majority' of criminal trials on hold for lockdown,"Until the end of February only the ""most serious"" trials will proceed, to reduce the number of people needed to attend. Such cases will include those with a ""significant risk"" to life, sexual or violent offending, or vulnerable witnesses. From 1 March, all criminal trials due to begin before 28 February will be adjourned until after the end of the current lockdown period, unless they fall within the ""most serious"" category. The changes were announced by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) following a review by Scotland's senior judges during a meeting with the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC. Temporary legislation was passed in March last year to allow most hearings to be held virtually, but physical attendance is still required for trials, with witnesses present in person and jurors sitting physically distanced in courtrooms. The SCTS said it was ""essential that the sheriffs and judges can exercise their discretion in the best interests of justice"". It added: ""This can only be done by holding hearings in person in court, where it is possible to do so safely."" A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said: ""We welcome the fact that, through the use of technology and other measures, it has been possible to continue to progress many cases during the pandemic. ""However, the restrictions have had a significant impact on the ability of the criminal courts to operate at full capacity. ""We are committed to continuing to work with our partners across the justice system to do all that we can to ensure that cases are progressed as quickly as possible without compromising on the principles of justice."" The number of Covid cases in Scotland has surged in recent weeks, after the emergence of the Omicron variant. The latest figures show there were 23,607 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours - more than at any other point in the pandemic. The total number of cases confirmed since the start of the pandemic now stands at 1,000,262. Meanwhile, another 17 deaths have been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 9,663. The Scottish government has urged people to stay at home as much as possible, and to avoid social gatherings, in a bid to slow the spread of Omicron. The latest measures announced by the SCTS are designed to reduce the number of people who need to attend court, and to help prevent the spread of Covid.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Farage: May 'wilfully deceiving' people over Brexit deal,"The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would not support it in Parliament and accused Mrs May of ""wilfully deceiving"" the public about the deal's implications. Mrs May has repeatedly said that her deal is the only one that can deliver Brexit and protect jobs. But Mr Farage said it would leave the UK ""tied to the EU"" and ""subject to EU laws"". ""This is not Brexit,"" he said. ""This is a new European treaty."" Mr Farage also accused Mrs May of ""wilfully deceiving"" the public about the deal's implications. He said she had promised that the UK would be able to leave the EU without paying a ""divorce bill"", but the deal would actually see the UK paying £39bn. ""She has wilfully deceived the public,"" he said. ""She has lied to the public."" Mrs May has denied that she has misled the public about the deal. She said that the £39bn payment is a ""settlement"" for the UK's obligations to the EU, and that it is necessary to secure a smooth and orderly Brexit. The interview came as Mrs May was facing mounting pressure from within her own party to abandon her Brexit deal. Several Conservative MPs have said they will not support the deal in Parliament, and there are fears that it could be defeated when it is put to a vote. If the deal is defeated, it would plunge the UK into further political uncertainty and could lead to a no-deal Brexit. This would mean the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place, which would have a significant impact on the UK economy and could lead to chaos at the border. The Brexit Party is a pro-Brexit party that was founded by Mr Farage. It is currently the largest party in the European Parliament, and has been gaining support in recent months. Mr Farage has been a vocal critic of Mrs May's Brexit deal, and has said that he would not support it in Parliament. He has also called for Mrs May to resign as Prime Minister.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Israel eases restrictions following vaccine success,"From Sunday, shops, libraries and museums can open but social distancing and masks are still required. The health ministry says it is because of the country's successful COVID-19 vaccination programme that these restrictions can now be eased. Over 80% of the population have been fully vaccinated and over 90% of over 60s have been vaccinated. The easing of restrictions comes as a relief to many businesses and there are hopes that the economy will start to recover. However, the health ministry is warning that the pandemic is not over and people should continue to be cautious. ""We have made great progress but we are not out of the woods yet,"" said health ministry spokesman Ofer Levy. ""We need to continue to be vigilant and follow the guidelines."" The easing of restrictions has been welcomed by some but others are concerned that it is too soon. ""I'm glad that things are starting to open up again but I'm also worried that it might be too soon,"" said Jerusalem resident Sarah Cohen. ""I think we should wait a little longer to make sure that the virus is under control."" The government has said that it will continue to monitor the situation and will tighten restrictions if necessary. ""We are taking a cautious approach,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We will not hesitate to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public."" Here is a summary of the restrictions that are being eased: Shops, libraries and museums can open. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed. Indoor gatherings of up to 20 people are allowed. Restaurants and cafes can open with outdoor seating only. Hotels can open with restrictions.

Henry Moore statue: Minister's concerns over sale plan,"Len Tingle Political editor, Yorkshire Now her planned sale is provoking a national outcry and the lady is certainly not going quietly. This week there was a fierce protest with locals blocking access to the site for hours. The statue, Ascending Form, is one of 11 works by Mr Moore commissioned for the Headingley campus in the 1970s. Following the collapse of the music department five years ago, the university sold the first of the bronze figures, Oval Forms, to an art dealer. It went to a private collector in Italy and fetched £6.5m. Now the university wants to sell more of its Moore artwork – three of the most significant pieces including Ascending Form. This has angered the local community, a large number of whom donated the money to pay for the statues in the first place. They believe that the university is reneging on an agreement made in 2004, when it was granted ownership, that the sculptures would remain on campus for the enjoyment of the people of Leeds. The protesters are furious and the outcry has reached Westminster. The arts minister, Lord Parkinson, has written to the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Simone Buitendijk, expressing his concerns. The minister has also offered to meet the university and local representatives to discuss the matter. But the university has accused the protesters of spreading misinformation and insisted it is within its rights to sell the sculptures. The university says it is not planning to sell all three of the pieces. Ascending Figure could be bought back using donations, but the university says the other two are “likely to be of interest to national or international institutions”. It also argues that the funds raised from the sale of the sculptures will be used to benefit the university and its students. But Henri Brocklebank, of the Action for Moore group, says the university is trying to cash in on its “cultural inheritance”. Mr Brocklebank said: “The only thing that has changed since 2004 is that the value of the sculptures has increased. So now the university has given itself a get-out clause. “It is the people of Leeds who paid for these sculptures. Why should they be flogged off to private collectors?” The university says it is not ignoring the wishes of the Leeds people. It says it is asking the Arts Council England to review the agreement made in 2004 and hopes to reach an agreement that allows it to sell some of the statues while still satisfying the desire to “retain these important works within the public realm in Leeds”.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The Indian tribe that gave up hunting to save forests,"At one time, 76-year-old Chaiyievi Zhiinyii was a skilled hunter. But he stopped hunting in 2001. The Angami tribe gave up what was an important source of livelihood some 20 years ago in order to create a community-owned forest reserve. The Angamis are one of the largest Naga tribes in Nagaland, a state in north-eastern India. They live in the foothills of the Himalayas, and their traditional way of life has always been closely tied to the forest. In the past, the Angamis hunted for food, and also to protect their crops from animals. But as the human population grew, so too did the demand for land. The forests were being cleared for agriculture, and the animals that the Angamis hunted were becoming increasingly scarce. In the late 1990s, the Angamis realized that they needed to take action to protect their forest. In 2001, they banned hunting in their traditional territory. They also set up a community forest management committee to manage the forest and ensure that it was used sustainably. The Angamis' decision to give up hunting was a difficult one, but it has paid off. The forest has now recovered, and the animals that live there are thriving. The Angamis are also able to collect firewood, fruits, and vegetables from the forest, which provides them with a source of food and income. The Angamis' story is an inspiring example of how a community can come together to protect their environment. It is also a reminder that we all have a responsibility to protect the planet for future generations. The Angamis' community-owned forest reserve is now a model for other communities in India. It has shown that it is possible to protect the environment while also meeting the needs of the local people. The Angamis are proud of what they have achieved, and they hope that their story will inspire other communities to take action to protect their environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
NI political reaction to Birmingham pub bombing apology,"Michael Christopher Hayes is a self-confessed republican bomb-maker. He said he was sorry that 21 innocent people died in the attack in 1974. Bombs exploded in two Birmingham pubs, killing 21 people and injuring over 180 on the evening of November 21, 1974, in what became known as the Birmingham pub bombings. Hayes, who was 28 at the time and had been serving a life sentence for his role in the bombings, was released in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In a statement released through his solicitor, Hayes said: ""I want to apologize to all those who suffered because of our actions. I know that an apology will not be enough for many people, but I hope that it will at least show that I am truly sorry for what happened that night."" Hayes' apology has been welcomed by some victims' families, but others have said they find it hard to forgive. Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings, said she was not ready to accept Hayes' apology. ""I don't think he's being genuine. I think he's just saying sorry because he's been caught,"" she said. ""I don't think he understands the pain that he caused."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said that Hayes' apology was ""a step in the right direction"", but he added that ""it is important to remember that this was a horrific crime that caused unimaginable suffering to many innocent people"". Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said that Hayes' apology was ""a significant gesture"", but he added that ""it is important that we do not allow this to overshadow the ongoing campaign for justice by the victims and their families"". The Birmingham pub bombings were one of the most notorious atrocities of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The bombings were carried out by the Provisional IRA, which was fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and create a united Ireland. The families of the victims have campaigned for justice for decades, and in 2012 the British government announced a new inquiry into the bombings.

Rio 2016: 'Welcome to Hell' warn police,"By BBC Trending\ What's popular and why Along with the relatives carrying flowers and taxi drivers waiting with name boards there were lines of off-duty police with banners that had a far more ominous message: ""Welcome to Hell"". These are not the usual words of welcome at an Olympic Games, but they are a reflection of the concerns that many in Brazil have about security at the Rio Games. In the lead-up to the Olympics, there have been several violent incidents in Rio, including a mugging of a Dutch journalist and a shooting in the Olympic Park. The police in Rio have been criticised for their heavy-handed tactics, and there are concerns that they may use excessive force during the Games. Despite these concerns, the Brazilian government has insisted that the Olympics will be safe. ""We have taken all the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the athletes and the public,"" said Sergio Cabral, the governor of Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian government has deployed 85,000 security personnel to the Games, including 47,000 police officers. The police will be using a variety of tactics to keep the Games safe, including facial recognition technology, surveillance cameras, and armed patrols. However, some experts are sceptical about whether the Brazilian government will be able to keep the Games safe. ""The Brazilian government has a lot of experience in policing large events, but the Olympics is a different beast,"" said Robert Muggah, a security expert at the Igarape Institute. ""The Olympics is a global event, and it attracts a lot of attention from criminals. The Brazilian government will need to be on its guard to prevent any major security incidents."" The Olympics are a major opportunity for Brazil to showcase its culture and achievements to the world. However, the security concerns are a reminder that Brazil still has a long way to go in terms of reducing crime and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Dog microchipping to be compulsory in Wales by 2015,"The move is seen as a way to improve animal welfare and develop responsible dog ownership by helping identify strays. It is estimated 190,000 dogs will be microchipped over the next five years. The Welsh Government has said the scheme will help reunite lost dogs with their owners, reduce the number of strays in pounds, and deter dog theft. Compulsory microchipping is already in place in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government said it is working with local authorities and animal welfare organisations to implement the scheme in Wales. Microchipping involves implanting a small electronic chip under the dog's skin, which contains a unique identification number. This number can be scanned by a vet or animal welfare officer to identify the dog and its owner. The Welsh Government said it will provide funding to help local authorities and animal welfare organisations cover the cost of microchipping dogs. The British Veterinary Association (BVA) has welcomed the Welsh Government's decision to make microchipping compulsory. ""Microchipping is a simple and effective way to identify dogs and reunite them with their owners if they get lost or stolen,"" said BVA president John Fishwick. ""We believe that compulsory microchipping will help to improve animal welfare and responsible dog ownership in Wales."" The RSPCA Cymru also welcomed the Welsh Government's decision. ""Compulsory microchipping is a positive step forward for animal welfare in Wales,"" said RSPCA Cymru chief executive Chris O'Brien. ""It will help to reunite lost dogs with their owners, reduce the number of strays in pounds, and deter dog theft."" The Kennel Club has also welcomed the Welsh Government's decision.

Iran nuclear deal: Rouhani says West has no right to make changes,"The US and French leaders announced on Tuesday that they were working on a ""new deal"" that would expand and extend the terms of the 2015 accord. But Mr Rouhani said they had no right to do so. ""The nuclear deal will remain in place in its present form,"" he said. ""No one can change it, not even the US and France."" Mr Rouhani's comments came after US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Paris and discussed the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has repeatedly criticized the deal, calling it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"". He has also said that he will withdraw the US from the agreement unless it is renegotiated. Macron has said that he wants to preserve the deal, but he has also called for it to be expanded to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional activities. The other signatories to the deal - the UK, Germany, Russia and China - have all said that they want to preserve the agreement in its current form. The Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2015 after years of negotiations. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The deal has been credited with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. However, it has also been criticized for not doing enough to address Iran's other activities, such as its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism. The future of the Iran nuclear deal is uncertain. Trump has said that he will withdraw the US from the agreement unless it is renegotiated. Macron has said that he wants to preserve the deal, but he has also called for it to be expanded. The other signatories to the deal have all said that they want to preserve the agreement in its current form. It remains to be seen whether the US and France will be able to negotiate a new deal that is acceptable to all parties. If they fail to do so, the Iran nuclear deal could collapse, which would have serious consequences for the region and the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Announcing the plans on Monday, Environment Minister Mairi Gougeon said: ""We are determined to protect Scotland's seas and safeguard our extraordinary marine environment for future generations, and we know that Marine Protected Areas are vital to achieving that. ""Designating Loch Torridon as an MPA will protect the area's diverse range of marine life, including the internationally important populations of basking sharks and other large marine species, as well as critically endangered flapper skate. ""This designation will support Scotland's commitment to the protection of our seas, building on the recent agreement reached at COP15 to protect at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030."" The Scottish Wildlife Trust welcomed the announcement, saying it would help to protect ""one of Scotland's most iconic marine species"". ""Flapper skate are a critically endangered species and we need to do everything we can to protect them,"" said the trust's chief executive, Maggie Keegan. ""This designation will help to ensure that this important habitat is safeguarded for future generations."" The MPA designation will prohibit activities such as bottom trawling, dredging and scallop dredging within the area. The Scottish government said it would work with stakeholders to ensure that fishing activities that do not damage the seabed can continue. The designation of Loch Torridon as an MPA is part of a wider programme of work to protect Scotland's seas. The Scottish government has already designated 33 MPAs around the coast of Scotland and is committed to designating more in the future. MPAs are designated under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. They are a key tool for protecting Scotland's marine environment and can help to conserve and enhance marine biodiversity, safeguard and restore marine ecosystems, and promote sustainable use of marine resources.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
How many migrant children cross the English Channel?,"By William McLennan BBC News More than 7,400 people have stepped into small boats and navigated one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world to reach the south coast of England in 2020. At least six people are now thought to have died trying to make the crossing so far this year, compared with at least four last year. The figures, released by the UK government, include people who have reached the UK on small boats, such as dinghies and kayaks, as well as larger commercial vessels. In 2019, the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats was 1,843. The majority of those crossing are single men from Iran, followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. The number of women and children crossing has also increased in recent months. In the first six months of 2020, there were 1,295 children who crossed the Channel, compared with 296 in the same period last year. The Home Office said it was ""working round the clock to tackle the issue"", including increasing patrols in the Channel and working with the French authorities to prevent people from leaving France. ""We are also working to return people who have no right to be in the UK to their home countries,"" a spokesperson said. However, campaigners have said that the government's response is ""inhumane"" and called for more safe and legal routes for people to seek asylum in the UK. ""The government's failure to provide safe and legal routes for people to seek asylum is forcing people to take desperate measures, like crossing the Channel in small boats,"" said Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council.

"Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat","Kamal Ahmed Economics editor@bbckamalon Twitter That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's everyday lives is now widely accepted, by politicians and economists alike. The question that vexed Mark Carney was whether the effects are likely to persist, worsen or ease in the remaining time available to complete the UK's withdrawal negotiations with the European Union. Having concluded that any unresolved Brexit will likely inflict ""material economic harm"", the governor of the Bank of England told the Treasury Select Committee, the biggest threat is now ""the risk of a no deal Brexit"". Theresa May's deal may not be perfect, Carney said, but it at least provides business with ""clarity"" about the rules that will pertain after the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU in March next year. Without a deal, he warned, ""firms would face significant disruption to their just-in-time supply chains, the movement of their staff, and the trade in goods and services"". All of which could take the UK's economic growth ""below zero for an extended period of time"". Carney's remarks come just weeks after the prominent Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg outlined his own vision of a ""no deal"" scenario, which included the prospect of reverting to trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms. The governor did not mention Rees-Mogg by name, but he warned that increased customs checks and tariffs would impose ""significant costs"" on UK companies. ""WTO rules are not costless,"" he said. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit has been dismissed by some as scaremongering by Remainers. But the governor's comments serve as a reminder that it is a very real possibility. The government's own analysis, published in November, estimated that a no-deal Brexit would cost each UK household £2,000 a year. The Bank of England's job is not to tell the government what to do on Brexit, but to ensure it has the tools at its disposal to mitigate the negative effects. But Carney's comments make it clear that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided, if at all possible. The problem is that the prime minister has effectively ruled out changing her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected by a large margin in the House of Commons last month. And the EU has said it is not prepared to reopen the negotiation. That leaves MPs with a difficult choice. They can either accept May's deal, vote against it and risk the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, or vote against it and force a delay to Brexit. The choice is theirs, but they should bear in mind the economic consequences of each option.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ian Paisley challenges BBC over Maldives 'wrongdoing' evidence,"He was speaking for the first time since a BBC Spotlight programme. It alleged the government minister paid for part of the trip. ""If there is something untoward, I'll be the first one to say 'Mea culpa'. Frankly, I don't know what the problem is,"" he said. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician was a guest of the Maldivian government on a five-day trip to the archipelago nation in November 2014. He travelled with his wife, Rhonda, and two party staff members. The programme alleged that the former North Antrim MP did not pay for any of the trip himself. It also said that the £10,000 cost was paid for by a Maldivian businessman who is a government adviser. It claimed that this businessman's company had subsequently been given a contract to provide security equipment to the Maldives government. Mr Paisley denies any wrongdoing and has threatened legal action against the BBC. He said: ""I have never met the person who allegedly paid for the trip. Nor have I ever spoken to him."" Mr Paisley said he believed the company that paid for the trip was owned by a different Maldivian businessman, whom he knows. ""I was asked if I would go and meet with the opposition, which I had intended to do on this trip,"" he said. ""I was told I would be meeting the president, the prime minister and other ministers and I agreed to do that."" He said he had met with the Maldivian president and had also met with the leader of the then-opposition Maldivian Democratic Party. However, he did not meet any opposition figures on this particular trip. He said he believed the Maldives government had paid for the trip. ""I did not pay for any of it,"" he said. ""I am not responsible for other people's expenses."" The BBC said it stands by the story. A spokesperson said: ""We robustly defend our journalism and maintain the accuracy of our reporting.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Billy Caldwell: Campaigner's company sells cannabis oil,"Charlotte Caldwell has been treating her severely epileptic son Billy, 12, with cannabis oil since 2016. His most recent supply was confiscated at Heathrow Airport. It was returned to him after doctors made clear it was necessary to prevent life-threatening seizures. Ms Caldwell, from Castlederg, Co Tyrone, believes the oil is the only thing that stops her son's seizures - which could otherwise strike up to 100 times a day. She has now set up a not-for-profit company that aims to import and distribute the oil to other families affected by childhood epilepsy. Charlotte's Web Ireland imports and distributes Bedrolite, a cannabis oil extract from the Netherlands. Bedrolite contains THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive component of cannabis, and CBD (cannabidiol), which has no psychoactive effect. The company has not yet received a license from the UK Home Office, making it illegal to sell or distribute the oil in the UK. However, Ms Caldwell said she is prepared to challenge the law if necessary. ""I am not going to sit here and watch my son suffer,"" she told the BBC. ""I am not going to wait for the government to give me permission to save my son's life."" Ms Caldwell said she had been contacted by more than 100 families from the UK who are desperate to access cannabis oil for their children. ""These children are suffering every single day,"" she said. ""They are having seizures that could kill them. We have to do something to help them."" A spokesman for the Home Office said: ""The misuse of drugs can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. ""The government has a responsibility to protect the public from the harms caused by controlled drugs and to ensure that they are used for legitimate medical purposes only."" The spokesman added that the Home Office is ""aware of the case of Billy Caldwell and is working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure that he receives the necessary medical treatment."" Ms Caldwell's campaign has been supported by a number of high-profile figures, including the actor and campaigner Michael Sheen. Sheen said: ""I believe that Charlotte Caldwell is a remarkable woman who is doing everything she can to save her son's life. ""The government should be ashamed of themselves for not doing more to help her.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Tintin and the vanishing murals: Brussels races to save art,"In the early 1920s Hergé, then a 15-year-old Georges Remi, was a scout and student at Institut St Boniface, in the Ixelles. One day, during an outing, he and his fellow scouts came across a derelict cottage in the nearby Forest of Soignes. Intrigued, they ventured inside and discovered a series of murals depicting the adventures of a young boy and his dog. The boy in the murals bore a striking resemblance to Hergé himself, and the dog to his own wire-haired fox terrier, Milou. Inspired by the discovery, Hergé began to develop the character of Tintin, who would go on to become one of the most iconic figures in the history of comics. Fast forward to the present day, and the murals that inspired Hergé are under threat. The cottage in which they were found has been left abandoned for decades, and the murals themselves are fading and peeling. In a race against time, the City of Brussels has launched a project to restore and preserve the murals, ensuring that they can be enjoyed by future generations. The restoration project is a complex and delicate undertaking. The murals are painted on a variety of surfaces, including plaster, wood, and canvas, and each requires a different approach. Conservators are using a variety of techniques, including laser cleaning, retouching, and consolidation, to restore the murals to their former glory. The project is expected to take several years to complete, but the results are already impressive. The murals are gradually regaining their vibrant colors and intricate details, and they are beginning to tell the story of Tintin's adventures once again. The restoration of the Tintin murals is a testament to the enduring legacy of Hergé's creation. Tintin has been translated into more than 100 languages and has sold more than 250 million copies worldwide. He is a beloved character who has inspired generations of readers and artists. The murals that inspired Hergé are a precious part of Tintin's history, and their restoration is a fitting tribute to the artist and his work.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pisa literacy survey: Finland loses top spot to Asians,"The tri-annual Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) survey of 15-year-olds ranked China's Shanghai region in first place. With Finland coming third, its education system has been a source of envy for many nations. However, this latest report suggests that even the best can be challenged. The survey, which tests students' reading, mathematics, and science skills, has been conducted since 2000 and is considered one of the most comprehensive international assessments of student achievement. In the latest round of testing, Shanghai students outperformed their peers in all three subjects. Singapore and Hong Kong also ranked highly, while Finland dropped to third place. The results have sparked a debate about the reasons for Finland's decline. Some experts believe that the country's education system has become too focused on equality and that it needs to do more to challenge its top students. Others argue that Finland is simply facing the same challenges as other developed countries, such as an aging population and increasing diversity. Whatever the reasons, the Pisa results suggest that Finland's education system is no longer the gold standard it once was. The country will need to make some changes if it wants to regain its top spot. One possible explanation for Finland's decline is that the country's education system has become too focused on equality. Finland has a long tradition of egalitarianism, and its education system is designed to ensure that all students have equal access to quality education. However, some experts believe that this focus on equality has come at the expense of excellence. Another possible explanation for Finland's decline is that the country is simply facing the same challenges as other developed countries, such as an aging population and increasing diversity. As the population ages, there are fewer young people to fill the teaching positions. This can lead to a decline in the quality of teaching, which can in turn lead to a decline in student achievement. Whatever the reasons, the Pisa results suggest that Finland's education system is no longer the gold standard it once was. The country will need to make some changes if it wants to regain its top spot.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Spyware use in domestic violence 'escalating',"By Zoe Kleinman Technology reporter, BBC News Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under £50 and are easy to use. Used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, they are increasingly being deployed by abusers in domestic violence cases. In June, the government launched a consultation on its Domestic Abuse Bill, which proposes creating a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"". However, the consultation does not address the issue of spyware. Sarah*, who was in an abusive relationship, said spyware was used on her during the eight years she was with her partner. ""He always had to have his phone next to him, and I'd get messages saying 'Are you where you say you are?'"" she said. ""At first I laughed it off and said he was being a bit OTT [over the top]. But it got more sinister. He'd know where I was all the time, even if I hadn't told him."" ""I found a tracking app on his phone,"" said Sarah. ""It was really easy to use. Once it's installed on a phone, it can track everything you do - where you go, who you call, and even your messages."" ""He'd send me messages saying 'I know you're with him' or 'I know you're there', and I'd be scared. I felt like I had no privacy. He knew everything about me."" Sarah is not alone. In a survey of 2,000 women by domestic violence charity Refuge, 40% said they had been tracked or monitored by their partner. ""In the past, domestic abuse was often physical,"" said Refuge's chief executive, Sandra Horley. ""But now, with the advent of new technologies, abusers are finding new ways to control and coerce their victims."" ""Spyware is particularly insidious because it is often invisible to the victim,"" said Horley. ""It can be installed on a phone without the victim's knowledge or consent, and it can be used to track their movements, access their messages, and even record their conversations."" ""This can have a devastating impact on the victim's life,"" said Horley. ""It can make them feel isolated, it can make them fear for their safety, and it can make it difficult for them to escape the relationship."" The government needs to do more to address the issue of spyware in domestic violence cases, said Horley. ""We need to raise awareness of the issue, we need to make it easier for victims to report spyware abuse, and we need to make sure that the police have the resources to investigate these crimes.""Sarah's name has been changed to protect her identity",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Energy firm's Cheshire plans refused by councillors,"Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee voted 10 to 1 to reject IGas's plans for Ellesmere Port because of ""climate change"" concerns. The company wanted to drill for gas at Ince Marshes, near the town, but councillors said it went against the council's policies on reducing emissions. IGas said it was ""disappointed"" but would ""consider its options"". The plans were opposed by environmental groups who said the project could increase greenhouse gas emissions. They also said it was located in an area that is at risk of flooding. The planning committee heard evidence from both sides before making its decision. IGas said the project would create jobs and help to reduce the UK's reliance on imported gas. The company also said it had taken steps to minimize the environmental impact of the project. However, the council's planning committee said the project was not in line with the council's policies on climate change. The committee also said it was not convinced that the project would create enough jobs to justify the environmental impact. IGas said it was ""disappointed"" by the council's decision. In a statement, the company said: ""We are disappointed by the decision of Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee to refuse our planning application for Ince Marshes. ""We believe that this project would have created jobs, reduced the UK's reliance on imported gas, and helped to meet the UK's energy needs in a responsible way. ""We will now consider our options."" The decision by the council's planning committee is the latest setback for IGas.

Did Boris Johnson just announce an election without actually doing so?,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor @bbclaurak Twitter He's always said that he really doesn't want to go to the country again. Downing Street insists that all the talk of an imminent election is just ""Westminster chatter"". But there's a different tone now and it's coming from the top. Today, Boris Johnson signalled that he is preparing for an election, telling Sky News: ""I don't want an election, but if there is one, we'll fight it and we'll win it."" It's a significant shift in language from the prime minister, who has until now been adamant that he doesn't want an election. So what's changed? One possibility is that Johnson has been spooked by the recent polls, which suggest that Labour is now ahead. Another possibility is that he believes that an election would give him a chance to break the deadlock in Parliament and get his Brexit deal through. Whatever his reasons, it's clear that Johnson is now preparing for an election. He's doing the things that a prime minister would do if they were planning to go to the country, such as setting out his vision for the future and attacking the opposition. Of course, it's still possible that Johnson will change his mind and decide not to call an election. But the latest comments from the prime minister suggest that he is increasingly likely to do so. If Johnson does call an election, it will be the third general election in less than five years. It would also be a high-stakes election, with the future of Brexit and the country's political landscape at stake. The latest YouGov poll, conducted on 13-14 October, put Labour on 38%, the Conservatives on 33%, the Liberal Democrats on 12%, the Brexit Party on 7% and the Greens on 5%. The poll also found that 40% of voters think Johnson is doing a bad job as prime minister, while 31% think he is doing a good job. The Conservatives have been trailing Labour in the polls for several months, and Johnson's personal ratings have also been falling. If the polls are accurate, Johnson would face an uphill battle to win an election. However, the prime minister has a track record of defying the odds, and he will be hoping to do so again at the next election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence,"Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities. It works. Amsterdam is to adopt an approach to reducing violence that has been successfully used in Cardiff. The Dutch city is to introduce a system of 'violence reduction units' (VRUs) which will bring together police, health and community groups to tackle the root causes of violence. The VRUs will work to identify and support people who are at risk of becoming involved in violence, and to provide them with access to services such as education, employment and housing. The approach is based on the work of Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University. Professor Shepherd has argued that violence is a public health issue, and that it can be reduced by addressing the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to it. The approach has been credited with helping to reduce violence in Cardiff. According to figures from the Home Office, the number of violent crimes recorded in Cardiff fell by 13% in the year to March 2022. This is compared to a 6% increase in violent crime across England and Wales as a whole. Professor Shepherd said: ""I am delighted that Amsterdam is to adopt our approach to reducing violence. This is a clear sign that our work is having an impact, and that it can be replicated in other cities."" The VRUs will be introduced in Amsterdam in the coming months. The city's mayor, Femke Halsema, said: ""We are committed to making Amsterdam a safer city for everyone. We believe that the violence reduction unit approach can help us to achieve this goal."" The VRUs will be part of a wider strategy to reduce violence in Amsterdam. The city is also investing in community policing, and in programmes to support young people who are at risk of becoming involved in violence. The Dutch city of Rotterdam is also considering adopting the Cardiff approach. Rotterdam is one of the most violent cities in the Netherlands, and the city council is keen to find ways to reduce violence. The Cardiff approach is a promising new approach to reducing violence. It is based on the evidence that violence is a public health issue, and that it can be reduced by addressing the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to it. The VRUs will be introduced in Amsterdam in the coming months. It will be interesting to see whether the approach can be as successful in Amsterdam as it has been in Cardiff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Rhino poaching: South Africa and Vietnam sign deal,"The price of rhino horn - used in traditional medicine in Asian countries - has soared. Rhino poaching is already banned under international conventions but the extent of the problem across Africa remains stubbornly high, driven by the huge profits to be made. South Africa is home to the majority of the world's rhinos. In 2017, 1,028 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa alone. In 2018, this number rose to 1,349. Vietnam is one of the largest markets for rhino horn, which is used in traditional medicine to treat a range of ailments, including cancer and impotence. The demand for rhino horn has led to a surge in poaching in South Africa, where the animals are often killed by armed gangs. The deal between South Africa and Vietnam is aimed at tackling the illegal trade in rhino horn. It will see the two countries work together to strengthen law enforcement, improve intelligence sharing, and reduce demand for rhino horn. The deal is a welcome step forward in the fight against rhino poaching. However, it is important to remember that this is a complex issue with no easy solutions. The demand for rhino horn in Asia is likely to continue to drive poaching, and it will take sustained efforts from all stakeholders to protect these iconic animals. In addition to the demand for rhino horn in Asia, there are a number of other factors that have contributed to the rise in poaching in South Africa. These include: Weak law enforcement: The South African government has been criticized for not doing enough to combat poaching. In many cases, poachers are able to operate with impunity. Corruption: Corruption within the South African government and law enforcement agencies has also been linked to the rise in poaching. This has made it difficult to bring poachers to justice. Poverty: Many of the people who are involved in poaching are poor and desperate. They see poaching as a way to make a living. The deal between South Africa and Vietnam is a positive step forward, but it is only one part of the solution. In order to effectively tackle rhino poaching, it is important to address all of the factors that are driving it. This includes strengthening law enforcement, reducing corruption, and addressing the poverty that is driving people to poach. It is also important to educate people in Asia about the devastating impact that the illegal trade in rhino horn is having on these iconic animals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""Seren has been on these medications for several years and they have been very effective in reducing her seizures. ""The thought of changing her medication at this stage is very worrying.""

TfW is currently replacing its entire fleet with new trains. The first of the new trains are due to enter service on the Core Valley Lines in north-east Wales in the autumn of 2023.

Coronavirus: Transport for London expects to lose £4bn,"Ahead of an emergency finance committee meeting, the organisation said it needs £3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for the next two years. The remainder would come from existing cash reserves of £900m, which the organisation said was ""unsustainable"". Sadiq Khan has asked the government to provide ""urgent financial support"" to TfL, which has lost fare revenue as passenger numbers plummeted during the pandemic. He said the government support was ""essential to avoid very difficult decisions that would damage London's economy"". The emergency budget assumes there will be no return to pre-pandemic patronage, and that revenue will only account for 70% of operating costs. The fare increase was originally due to come into effect in January 2023, but TfL said it was now proposing to introduce it in March to raise more funds. The budget also proposed increasing the congestion charge for the most polluting vehicles from £12.50 to £24 in October 2023. TfL has already received about £4bn in government support during the pandemic. The transport authority said it was ""committed to working with the government to find a mutually acceptable solution that ensures TfL can continue to deliver its vital services efficiently, without the need for significant cuts to its services or staff"". A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the challenges facing TfL and are committed to working closely with the mayor to reach a fair and sustainable settlement. ""We continue to provide multi-billion pound support and have recently agreed the principles of a long-term funding settlement. ""We urge the mayor to take urgent action to improve TfL's financial position, including exploring additional commercial opportunities to generate revenue, reduce costs, and prioritise investment in the network.""

Anti-Semitic Valentine at Republican student event sparks outrage,"Warning: Some readers may find some language offensive College Republicans at Central Michigan University were distributing gift bags to students that included a Valentine's Day card containing a message widely condemned as anti-Semitic.

The group has also removed the cards from circulation and said that it will be conducting sensitivity training for its members. The incident has sparked outrage on campus and beyond. Many students have expressed their disgust and anger at the distribution of the cards. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" said one student. ""I'm disgusted that this happened on our campus."" Another student said: ""This is not just a joke. This is hate speech. It's dangerous and it needs to be condemned."" The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, has also condemned the incident. ""This is a clear example of anti-Semitism,"" said ADL regional director David Lorenz. ""The use of the swastika and the phrase 'gas the Jews' is deeply offensive and hateful."" Lorenz said that the incident is a reminder of the need for continued vigilance against anti-Semitism.

Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen re-labelled food,"The inspection of the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel found food had been re-labelled to extend its shelf life. Dozens of containers of items - including discoloured meat and fish - were uncovered by Aberdeen City Council's environmental health officers. The hotel, located in the city centre, has since been re-branded as the Sandman Signature Aberdeen Hotel & Spa. The council's report said: ""During our inspection, the following issues were noted which were of major concern."" Food items were being re-labelled with new dates to extend their shelf life. Discoloured meat and fish were being stored in the chiller. Cooked meat was being stored at an unsafe temperature. Raw meat was being stored above cooked meat. Food was being stored in open containers. The kitchen was dirty and unhygienic. The council's environmental health officers served the hotel with a prohibition notice, which means that the hotel cannot serve food until the issues have been resolved. A spokesperson for the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel said: ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our guests.

Snow disruption warning stepped down,"Snow disruption warning stepped down It steps down Police Scotland advice to stage two after being escalated to stage four ""do not travel"" overnight. A yellow Met Office weather warning for snow is in place until 12pm today. Stage two of Police Scotland's guidance means that road travel should only be undertaken when essential, and only if the journey can be completed safely. Stage four advice, which was in place from 8pm on Monday until 9am on Tuesday, meant that the public were told that all non-essential travel should be avoided. The Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice covers central, southern, and eastern parts of Scotland, as well as parts of northern England, including Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, and Yorkshire and the Humber. The warning states that snow and ice could cause disruption to travel and may lead to power cuts and loss of mobile phone signal. The Scottish Government has urged people to follow the advice of Police Scotland and the Met Office. A spokesperson said: ""The safety of the public is our top priority. We urge everyone to follow the advice of the police and the Met Office. If you have to travel, please do so with extreme care and only if your journey is essential."" The Scottish Government has also advised schools to make their own decisions on whether to close based on the local conditions. A spokesperson said: ""Head teachers will be best placed to make a decision on whether or not to close their school based on the local weather conditions. They will be able to take into account factors such as the safety of pupils and staff, the accessibility of the school, and the availability of public transport."" The latest weather forecast for Scotland can be found on the Met Office website. Advice for motorists Only travel if your journey is essential. If you do have to travel, check the latest weather forecast and road conditions before you set off. Allow extra time for your journey and take breaks as needed. Be prepared for delays and cancellations. Make sure your vehicle is well-maintained and has winter tires fitted. Carry a winter emergency kit in your vehicle, including items such as blankets, food, water, and a first-aid kit.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Russia: Fire kills 14 sailors aboard navy research submersible,"The crew was poisoned by fumes as the vessel was taking measurements in Russian territorial waters on Monday. The ministry gave no details about the type of vessel. But Russian media reports say it was an AS-12 Losharik-class deep-diving nuclear submarine. LOSHarik submarines are designed for underwater research, rescue operations and special missions. The vessel was said to have been operating in the Barents Sea when the fire broke out. The submarine managed to surface, and the crew evacuated onto a rescue vessel, the ministry said. But 14 sailors died from smoke inhalation. The rest of the crew received medical assistance, with three in a serious condition. The ministry said that all necessary measures were being taken to establish the cause of the fire and to provide assistance to the victims' families. Accidents involving Russian military vessels have happened before. In 2000, the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk was destroyed in a huge explosion, killing all 118 crew members. And in 2019, 14 sailors died in a fire on board a research submersible in the Pacific Ocean. Following Monday's disaster, the Russian navy has suspended all deep-sea operations. The AS-12 Losharik-class submarines are relatively new, entering service in 2003. They are designed to operate at depths of up to 6,000 metres (19,685 ft) and can stay submerged for up to 100 days. The submarines are equipped with a variety of sensors and equipment for underwater research and exploration. The Russian navy has a long history of operating submarines, dating back to the 19th century. The country has one of the largest submarine fleets in the world, with over 50 submarines in service. The submarines play a key role in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy and are also used for intelligence gathering and other missions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
How Meryl became Margaret,"By Tim Masters Entertainment correspondent, BBC News, in Los Angeles Mark Coulier is one half of the team that transformed one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars into one of Britain's most iconic prime ministers. The Oscar-winning make-up artist says Meryl Streep, who plays Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, was instantly recognisable in the role. ""She looks like her, she sounds like her, her mannerisms are like her,"" Coulier told the BBC. ""But because the face is so familiar, the audience will be looking to find Meryl Streep. So part of the job is to distract the audience from that."" The first step was to take a mould of Streep's face and make a plaster cast of it. This cast was then covered with a special make-up that became Thatcher's skin. Coulier had to be extremely precise in his work. ""We had to get the age right, and we had to get the character right,"" he said. ""We also had to make sure that the make-up was not too heavy, because it would have interfered with Meryl's performance."" Coulier spent hours studying photographs and videos of Thatcher to get her look just right. He also had to take into account the fact that Streep would be wearing a wig and heavy prosthetics. ""We had to make sure that the prosthetics fit perfectly and that they didn't move around when Meryl was speaking,"" Coulier said. ""We also had to make sure that the make-up stayed in place under the lights and in different weather conditions."" Coulier's work on The Iron Lady has been praised by critics and audiences alike. In a review of the film, the New York Times said that Streep's performance was ""so physically accurate that it's almost uncanny."" Coulier is proud of his work on The Iron Lady, but he says that the most important thing was to help Streep create a believable and compelling performance. ""I wanted to create a make-up that would allow Meryl to disappear into the role,"" he said. ""I think we achieved that.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Myanmar court finds trio guilty of insulting religion,"Philip Blackwood, who managed the VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested in December along with bar owner Tun Thurein and colleague Htut. They were accused of insulting religion after a photo of them standing near a sign that referenced the Buddha in an allegedly disrespectful way was posted on Facebook. All three men denied the charges. The court heard that the defendants had been drinking at the bar when they decided to take a photo in front of the sign, which read ""The Best F*ing Curry in Yangon"". The prosecution argued that the photo was offensive to Buddhists because it showed the men standing with their backs to the Buddha image and making hand gestures that were considered disrespectful. The defendants' lawyers argued that the photo was not intended to be offensive and that the men had no intention of insulting religion. They said that the men were simply having fun and that the photo was taken in a light-hearted manner. The court found all three men guilty of insulting religion and sentenced them to two and a half years in prison. The defendants' lawyers said that they would appeal the verdict. The case has been widely condemned by human rights groups, who say that it is a violation of freedom of expression. The United States Embassy in Myanmar has also expressed concern about the verdict, saying that it ""undermines freedom of religion and expression"". The verdict has also sparked protests in Myanmar, with hundreds of people taking to the streets to demand the release of the defendants. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some reports of violence. The case has highlighted the challenges that Myanmar faces in balancing freedom of expression with respect for religion. The country is home to a number of different religions, and there is a long history of religious tension. The government has been trying to promote religious tolerance, but the case of the VGastro Bar defendants has shown that there is still a long way to go.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Eurovision Song Contest: Ireland knocked out,"By Neil Smith Entertainment reporter, Kiev Galway-born Brendan Murray, 20, had a hot-air balloon with him on stage in Kiev, but it was not enough to lift him into the Eurovision final. Murray made headlines with his whimsical performance of Dying to Try in Tuesday's semi-final but the song failed to take flight with voters. The singer was Ireland's first Eurovision entrant since 2015 and looked emotional as the results were being announced. ""Thank you so much Ireland, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me this amazing opportunity,"" he wrote on Twitter after the show. ""The memories I've made over the past few weeks will stay with me forever. I'm gutted not to qualify for Eurovision but it's been an incredible experience."" Ireland has won the Eurovision Song Contest seven times, more than any other country, but Murray's defeat means the country will not be in the final for the fourth year in a row. Murray's performance was one of the most talked-about moments of the semi-final. He emerged from a large hot-air balloon wearing a sequined suit and clutching a microphone stand topped with a giant pair of angel wings. The song itself was a catchy pop number with a soaring chorus, but it was not enough to convince voters to part with their points. Ireland was one of 18 countries competing in the first semi-final, with only 10 progressing to the final on Saturday. The other countries to qualify were Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Moldova and Sweden. The United Kingdom is automatically in the final as one of the ""big five"" countries, along with France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The remaining 10 finalists will be decided in Thursday's second semi-final, with the final taking place on Saturday.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Japan protests over China ships near disputed islands,"This is the first such protest under new PM Shinzo Abe, who was elected last month. It also comes amid reports that he wants to increase defence spending. Chinese ships have sailed near the islands many times in the past, and the two countries have been embroiled in a long-running dispute over who owns them. The islands are known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China. Japan says it has controlled the islands since 1895, but China says it has a long history of control over them. The dispute flared up again last month when Japan bought some of the islands from a private owner. China sent ships to the area in response, and the two sides have been engaged in a series of diplomatic protests ever since. The latest protest is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. It comes at a time when there is already tension between them over a number of issues, including trade and China's growing military power. The dispute over the islands is also seen as a test of Abe's resolve to stand up to China. Abe has taken a more hawkish stance on foreign policy than his predecessor, and he has promised to defend Japan's territory. However, he is also aware of the need to maintain good relations with China, which is Japan's largest trading partner. The protest over the ships is a sign that Abe is willing to take a tough line with China, but it is also likely to be a calculated risk. If the dispute escalates, it could have serious consequences for both countries.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Wales' child safety 'needs more co-ordination ,' says charity","On top of this, the report calls for a ""whole-government approach to child accident prevention"" with road and water safety the priorities, as well as home safety. The charity is also promoting 'play safety zones' where children can play freely without the risk of traffic, and for reduced speed limits around schools and other places where young people gather. The report also found that: • More than 30% of parents said they do not feel confident giving first aid to their children. • 300 children under 15 in Wales die or are seriously injured in accidents every year. • Accidents in the home account for almost a fifth of deaths or serious injuries among Welsh children. The NSPCC Cymru/Wales conducted an opinion poll among 1,000 parents in Wales of children aged 0-14, and gathered their experiences of accidents and safety concerns. The charity's head of service for Wales, Des Mannion, said: ""Children learn from their experiences and accidents can happen when they are exploring their surroundings and trying out new things. ""But we can prevent many childhood accidents from happening at all, and we can also reduce the severity of injuries by taking steps to make the places where children live and play safer. ""All parents can follow our simple advice to help prevent accidents, but more action is needed from government and professionals to make our communities safer for all children. ""This means improved training for staff working with children, a greater focus on road safety by local authorities and more resources for initiatives to educate parents and children about safety issues."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We welcome the NSPCC's report and share its aims of reducing the number of accidents involving children in Wales. ""We have already introduced a number of measures to improve child safety, including reducing the default speed limit on restricted roads to 20 mph, and we are committed to working with our partners to further improve child safety in Wales."" The Welsh government has also recently launched a new road safety campaign, 'Be Safe, Be Seen', which is aimed at reducing the number of children killed or seriously injured on the roads. The campaign is urging parents to ensure that their children are visible to drivers when they are out and about, by wearing bright clothing and using reflective materials.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sydney seaplane crash: Wreckage raised from riverbed,"On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage of the seaplane from the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, on Friday. The plane was raised from about 50m (165ft) underwater. The bodies of those on board were not found inside, but it is hoped the operation will help police determine how the crash occurred. The seaplane had been travelling from Sydney to Rose Bay when it crashed on New Year's Eve. Australian police said the plane was lifted slowly out of the water at a rate of 3m (10ft) per hour, with the process being delayed by the need to clear debris from the riverbed. Once the wreckage was raised, it was taken to a facility where it will be stored until further forensic examination can be carried out. Police divers had previously recovered the plane's fuselage and one of its floats, but the main body of the aircraft remained submerged. The crash is being investigated by Australian authorities. Preliminary findings suggest the plane sent out a distress signal before crashing, but it is not yet known what caused the incident. The victims have been identified as Mr Cousins, 58, his partner Emma Bowden, 48, his two sons Edward, 23, and William, 25, his daughter Sophie, 22, and the pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. Mr Cousins was the former chief executive of Compass Group, a UK-based food services multinational. He was also a director of the BBC and a former member of the UK government's Business Advisory Group. Paying tribute to him, Prime Minister Theresa May described him as ""a great British business leader"". ""He was a passionate advocate for business and his contribution to the UK economy was immense,"" she said. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is also investigating the crash. It is expected to release a preliminary report into the incident within the next six to eight weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid: North East hospitals warn over 'rapidly rising' admissions,"Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital has temporarily suspended non-urgent elective surgery to free up staff. In a joint statement, the bosses of several health trusts said they were having to deal with ""rapidly rising"" numbers of covid-related admissions. The number of Covid patients in North East hospitals has increased by 50% in the last week, with 1,118 people now being treated. The bosses of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said the rise was putting ""significant pressure"" on the region's hospitals. ""We are seeing a rapidly rising number of patients with COVID-19 and this is having a significant impact on our hospitals,"" they said. ""As a result, we have had to make the difficult decision to temporarily suspend non-urgent elective surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead. ""This will allow us to free up staff to care for the increasing number of patients with COVID-19. ""We understand that this will be disappointing for patients who have been waiting for surgery, but we hope they will understand that this is a necessary step to ensure that we can continue to provide safe and effective care for all of our patients."" The bosses said they were doing everything they could to increase the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients and were working with other NHS organisations in the region to ensure that patients could be transferred to the most appropriate hospital. They urged people to continue to follow the government's advice on social distancing, wearing face masks in indoor public places, and getting vaccinated. ""The best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 is to get vaccinated,"" they said.

Covid: Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health boards offer tests for 'flu symptoms',"People in the Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health board areas with flu symptoms or who are unwell after contact with a confirmed Covid case can get tested. People are being urged to take up the offer even if they have had a negative Covid test in the past. The director of public health for Hywel Dda, Dr Brendan Mason, said: “We would encourage people to get tested for both flu and Covid-19 this winter, particularly if they have any symptoms, as it will help to protect both themselves and their loved ones.” Cwm Taf Morgannwg is offering mass testing for anyone over the age of 16 who lives in the county borough. The testing is being carried out at walk-in test centres in Aberdare, Merthyr and Mountain Ash. The leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Andrew Morgan, said: “We strongly encourage everyone who can get tested to do so.” The Welsh government announced earlier this week that everyone over the age of 65 in Wales will be offered a free flu vaccine this winter. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said: “I urge everyone who is eligible to take up the offer of a free flu vaccine.” The flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself against the flu. It is safe and effective, and it can help to reduce your risk of getting the flu by up to 60%. If you do get the flu, the vaccine can help to reduce the severity of your symptoms. The NHS is also offering free flu vaccines to people who are pregnant, have a long-term health condition, or are in a care home. You can book an appointment for a flu vaccine at your GP surgery or local pharmacy. The flu virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing, or close contact with someone who is infected. Symptoms of the flu can include fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. The flu can be a serious illness, and it can lead to hospitalisation or even death. If you have any symptoms of the flu, it is important to stay at home and get tested.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Canada's 'free the beer' case loses in Supreme Court,"Canada's top court upheld a New Brunswick liquor law limiting the amount of alcohol that can be carried across its provincial border. In 2012, Gerald Comeau was stopped and fined for bringing more than the 12-pint maximum into the province. He challenged the law, arguing that it violated his mobility rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 against Comeau, finding that the law was a valid exercise of the province's authority to regulate alcohol sales. The Court found that the law was aimed at protecting public health and safety by reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm. It noted that New Brunswick has a higher rate of alcohol-related deaths and hospitalizations than other provinces. The Court also found that the law was not overly restrictive, as it allowed individuals to bring a reasonable amount of alcohol into the province for personal use. The Court's decision is a blow to those who advocate for the free movement of alcohol across provincial borders. However, it is also a reminder that provinces have the authority to regulate alcohol sales in order to protect public health and safety. The decision is also likely to have implications for other provinces that have similar laws. For example, Nova Scotia has a law that limits the amount of alcohol that can be brought into the province to 12 pints of beer, 12 ounces of spirits, or 1.5 litres of wine. It is possible that this law could also be challenged in court. The Supreme Court's decision is a complex one that weighs the individual's right to mobility against the province's right to regulate alcohol sales. Ultimately, the Court found that the province's interest in protecting public health and safety outweighed the individual's right to bring more alcohol into the province.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
China jails two more Tibetan monks over fire death,"Chinese authorities say the man, Rigzin Phuntsog of the Kirti monastery, immolated himself on 16 March. Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum will be jailed for 13 and 10 years respectively for ""intentional homicide"", Xinhua reported. The pair protested against Beijing's rule in Tibet, as well as China's treatment of the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule and now lives in India. The court heard the monks had spread leaflets and set fire to Tsering Tenzin's house to lure police to the scene, Xinhua reported. The monks had given Rigzin Phuntsog petrol and a lighter, the report said. The court was told that Tsering Tenzin ""felt ashamed"" after police put out the fire at his home. ""But he and Tenchum encouraged the victim to continue carrying out his self-immolation action, which resulted in the victim setting himself on fire again,"" Xinhua news agency reported. The court said it had taken into consideration the fact that the pair had confessed and pleaded guilty. The verdict comes as Beijing is stepping up security in Tibetan areas after reports of several self-immolations. Chinese state media said troops have been deployed in the Tibetan area of Kardze, where there were five self-immolations over the last month. Meanwhile, in London, the protesters outside the Chinese embassy clashed with police as they tried to enter the building. About 150 members of the Tibetan community and their supporters were demonstrating against the jailing of the monks. The protesters shouted slogans and waved Tibetan flags and placards before police moved in to push them back. The demonstrators said they were angry about the sentences and wanted the Chinese government to respect Tibetan rights. ""We are here to protest against the unlawful arrest and imprisonment of the two Tibetan monks,"" said Karma Yeshi, a spokesman for the Tibetan Community in the UK. ""They have been charged with intentional homicide, which is a serious charge, but they are innocent,"" he said. ""The Chinese authorities have failed to provide any evidence to support the charges and we believe they have been jailed for their peaceful protests against China's oppressive rule in Tibet.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jack Phillips: Boy from Godalming became Titanic hero,"By Sally Nancarrow BBC News, Surrey The son of a draper, Jack Phillips operated the most modern and powerful wireless equipment of any merchant ship of the time. But before the doomed vessel sailed, he learnt it was to be called Titanic rather than Olympic. The ships were often confused, as they were almost identical sister ships built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. Born in Godalming, Surrey, the son of a draper, Phillips joined the Royal Naval Reserve, but suffered from seasickness so became a wireless operator instead. Aged 25, and just two months into his first job as a radio operator on the Amerika, he was called up to join the Titanic. Phillips was one of the two wireless operators on board and the only one to survive the sinking. For over 70 years after the ship hit an iceberg and sank on the night of 14 April 1912, it was believed that Phillips had gone down with the ship. But in 1985, his body was identified in a Nova Scotia cemetery. His grave bears an inscription reading: ""In loving memory of Jack Phillips, wireless operator on the ill-fated SS Titanic, who gave his life in the service of others."" 'A Titanic struggle' Some 80 years after his death, Phillips's great-nephew, Ian Phillips, a retired police officer from Farnham, Surrey, wrote a book, A Titanic Struggle, about his life and death. ""I grew up knowing about Jack. He was a bit of a hero,"" he told the BBC. ""When I started researching his life, I was particularly struck by his tenacity and his determination to complete a task. ""He finished sending that final distress call, which led to lifeboats being despatched to help some of the passengers survive."" Phillips tirelessly tried to get a distress message out. One of the last messages sent was: ""Come at once. We have struck a berg."" He stayed at his post in the Marconi wireless room despite taking time to put on a lifejacket. Phillips may have lived if he had got into a lifeboat, as his body was found with a lifejacket on. The Marconi wireless room was on the port side of the Titanic and therefore most exposed to the freezing water when the ship sank. His body was among the first to be recovered, just six days after the ship went down. Phillips was buried in Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where many of the Titanic dead were laid to rest, but his body was exhumed in 1985. DNA testing was used to positively identify his remains, which were reburied in the same plot. Phillips's story was brought to life again in the 1997 James Cameron film Titanic. The character Harold Bride, who sent the final distress call, was based partly on Phillips. His great-nephew believes Phillips has been undervalued in the aftermath of the Titanic disaster. ""He was a Godalming boy who achieved international fame and has been largely forgotten,"" said Ian Phillips.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Church of England schools tackle gay bullying,"The Bible or religious texts should not be used to justify homophobic behaviour, says the advice sent to all Church of England schools. But homosexuality is recognised as a ""divisive issue"" in the church. The guidance says that all pupils, staff, and visitors should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. It adds that schools should: - Create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students - Challenge homophobic behaviour and language - Support students who are experiencing homophobic bullying - Work with parents and carers to promote understanding and acceptance ""We want to make it clear that there is no place for homophobia in our schools. We want to create a safe and welcoming environment where all pupils feel respected and valued,"" said Nigel Genders, chief education officer for the Church of England. In recent years, the Church of England has come under increasing pressure to clarify its stance on homosexuality. In 2017, the General Synod, the church's governing body, voted to reject a motion that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry in church. The decision was met with disappointment by many LGBT+ Christians and their supporters. It also led to calls for the church to do more to tackle homophobia in its schools. The new guidance is a step in the right direction. It sends a clear message that homophobia is not tolerated in Church of England schools. It also provides schools with practical guidance on how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. However, the guidance does not go as far as some LGBT+ campaigners would like. For example, it does not require schools to teach about same-sex relationships in a positive way. Despite these limitations, the guidance is a welcome step forward. It shows that the Church of England is taking the issue of homophobia in schools seriously. It also provides schools with the tools they need to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The university said it was ""disappointed"" by the virtual protests and that it was ""confident that the vast majority of our students feel supported and positive about their learning experiences."" The protests come as universities across the UK face criticism for their handling of the pandemic. Students at several other universities have also staged protests over issues such as rent, online learning, and mental health support. The National Union of Students (NUS) has called on the government to provide more financial support to students and to ensure that universities are providing a high-quality education online. The government has said that it is committed to supporting students during the pandemic and has announced a number of measures, including a £256m package of support for students in financial hardship. However, the NUS has said that more needs to be done to ensure that all students are able to access the support they need. The University of Exeter said it was ""committed to providing a high-quality education for all of our students"" and that it was ""working hard to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.""

Swine flu offers 'extraordinary super immunity',"By Michelle Roberts Health reporter, BBC News In beating a bout of H1N1 the body makes antibodies that can kill many other flu strains, a study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine shows. Doctors' hopes of developing an effective universal flu vaccine have been boosted by the discovery that natural infection with swine flu produces antibodies which can tackle many different strains of the virus. Flu is caused by an influenza virus that is constantly changing. This means the body needs to be exposed to a new vaccine every year. But scientists have been trying to develop a universal vaccine that would offer protection against all strains of flu. Now a study by researchers at Imperial College London and the US National Institutes of Health suggests that a Bout of H1N1 could act like a universal vaccine. They found that people who had recovered from swine flu developed antibodies that were able to recognise the 'stalk' of different strains of flu. The stalk portion of the influenza virus is well conserved, meaning that it does not change much from one strain to the next. This means that an antibody that can recognise the stalk can potentially kill a wide range of flu strains. Dr Michael Farzan, one of the authors of the study, said: ""We were very excited to find out that antibodies from individuals infected with H1N1 can neutralise these viruses, which belong to different subtypes and have different hemagglutinin proteins. ""This means that natural infection could induce a form of cross-immunity that we have not seen before with other flus."" Participants who recovered from H1N1 were able to generate antibodies that neutralised the H1N1 virus they had been exposed to, but also the strains of flu virus involved in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the bird flu strain, H5N1, and two other strains of H1N1 swine flu. The researchers say that the study offers hope for developing a universal flu vaccine. ""This is a promising finding for the development of universal flu vaccines because it suggests that boosting antibodies to the influenza virus stalk could protect against viruses that may be very different from those encountered in the past,"" said Dr Farzan. However, the researchers caution that it will take many years of research to develop, test and refine a universal flu vaccine that is safe and effective. ""We need to understand a little bit more about how these antibodies are induced by natural infection,"" said Dr Farzan. ""But I think that this is a lead that we will pursue for our research going forward.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Saudi Arabia's women vote in election for first time,"Women were also standing as candidates, another first, despite the conservative kingdom being the only nation where women are not allowed to drive. A total of 978 women have registered as candidates in 13 of the country's 13 regions, competing for 20 seats allocated for women in the 150-member assembly. Among them is Samia al-Bakri, a 46-year-old running in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. ""I am so proud of this moment. I have waited long for this,"" she said before the first round of voting on December 12. The female candidates represent a range of backgrounds and expertise, including doctors, lawyers, teachers, and businesswomen. Their decision to stand for election reflects a growing desire among Saudi women to have a greater role in public life. ""Women's participation in the elections is a significant milestone in the history of Saudi Arabia,"" said Dr. Hala al-Dosari, a prominent Saudi women's rights activist. ""It sends a message that women are just as capable as men to contribute to the decision-making process."" The local elections are part of a wider process of reforms initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has sought to modernize the country and improve its image abroad. However, women's rights activists have criticized the government for not doing enough to address other restrictions on women, such as the driving ban and the male guardianship system that requires women to have permission from a male relative to travel, work, or study. Despite these limitations, many Saudi women are optimistic that the local elections will be a positive step towards greater equality. ""This is just the beginning,"" said Aisha al-Mana, a 25-year-old voter. ""We have a long way to go, but we are moving in the right direction."" The elections are also being closely watched by other countries in the region, where women's rights are often severely restricted. The participation of Saudi women in the political process could inspire similar reforms elsewhere. The local elections are an important step forward for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. While there is still much work to be done, the participation of women in the political process is a sign of progress. It is hoped that these elections will lead to greater equality and representation for women in the kingdom.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Life-extending lung cancer nivolumab drug approved,"Campaigners, including the late Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill, have repeatedly called for access to the immunotherapy, which can add months to life. Scotland already provides the drug through its health service. Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ""We strongly welcome this announcement which will save lives, and it is an important moment for UK cancer care. ""For too long, patients in England have faced unnecessary delays in getting access to nivolumab. Now, they will benefit from the same level of care as those in countries such as Scotland and Wales. ""Nivolumab demonstrates the transformational power of cancer immunotherapy. It is a new type of cancer treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells. ""Nivolumab has shown great promise in clinical trials, and it is already helping thousands of patients with lung cancer and other types of cancer around the world. ""We look forward to seeing the NHS quickly implementing the use of nivolumab so that all patients who could benefit from it can access it as soon as possible."" Dr Alex Stewart, Cancer Research UK's head of population science, said: ""This is excellent news for patients with advanced lung cancer in England. ""Nivolumab has been shown to improve survival in patients with this type of cancer, and it is a welcome addition to the range of treatments available to them. ""We hope that the NHS will now quickly implement the use of nivolumab so that all patients who could benefit from it can access it as soon as possible.""

UK to probe Huawei staff's role at cybersecurity centre,"The news follows a report by Parliament's intelligence committee which raised concerns that staff working at the base in Oxfordshire were employed by the Chinese telecoms firm. Part of their job is to test Huawei's own equipment. The government has said it will now conduct its own investigation into the matter. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We are aware of the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and we are considering its findings."" The report, which was published on Tuesday, said that the government had ""failed to take account of the national security risks"" of allowing Huawei to work at the centre. It also said that the government had ""not properly considered"" the potential for Huawei to use its access to the centre to gather intelligence. The government has defended its decision to allow Huawei to work at the centre, saying that the company is a ""valued partner"" in the UK's telecommunications industry. However, the report's findings have raised concerns about the government's approach to cybersecurity. The report comes at a time when the UK is facing increasing pressure from the US to ban Huawei from its 5G networks. The US has accused Huawei of being a security risk, and has urged its allies to do the same. The UK government has so far resisted pressure from the US, but the report's findings could make it more difficult for the government to continue to support Huawei. The report's findings are likely to fuel the debate about the role of Chinese companies in the UK's critical infrastructure. The government will need to carefully consider the report's findings and decide how to respond.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UK government to press for European Court reform,"Ken Clarke said the government would press for changes to the way the court operated when the UK takes over the chairmanship of the Council of Europe. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, he said the UK had been “too quick” to condemn the court in the past and should now focus on reforming it from within. The court has been criticized for being too slow, too expensive, and too political. Clarke said the government would propose changes to make the court more efficient and less bureaucratic. He also said the UK would push for the court to be given more powers to enforce its rulings. The Council of Europe is a 47-member organization that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The UK will take over the chairmanship of the organization in November. Clarke's comments come after a number of high-profile cases in which the court has ruled against the UK government. In 2012, the court ruled that the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting was unlawful. In 2014, the court ruled that the UK government had failed to protect the rights of a man who was killed by police. The government has argued that these rulings show that the court is out of touch with the British public. However, Clarke said the government should not simply withdraw from the court, but should instead work to reform it from within. He said: “We have been too quick to condemn the court. We should now focus on reforming it from within. The UK has a long history of upholding human rights and the rule of law. We should be at the forefront of efforts to strengthen the European Court of Human Rights.” Clarke's comments were welcomed by human rights groups. Amnesty International UK said: “Ken Clarke is right to say that the UK should not simply withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights. The court plays a vital role in protecting human rights across Europe.” Liberty said: “We welcome Ken Clarke's commitment to reforming the European Court of Human Rights. The court is an essential part of the UK's human rights framework and we will work with the government to ensure that it remains effective.”",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pensioner liable for Donald Trump golf court expenses,"US tycoon Mr Trump hopes to build the ""world's greatest golf resort"" at Menie, north of Aberdeen. Molly Forbes, 86, and her 84-year-old husband Ian live in a modest stone-built cottage next door to the proposed site of the luxury development. The couple has been told they could face a legal bill of up to £100,000 after formally objecting to Mr Trump's plans. They are among 12 people who have lodged challenges with the Scottish government against the development. The Forbeses say they cannot afford the legal costs they have already incurred and have appealed for financial help. They fear they could lose their home if they are forced to pay the full amount. ""We're terrified,"" said Mrs Forbes. ""We don't know where we're going to find that sort of money. We've never had to pay legal fees before."" The Forbeses are not the only ones facing potential legal costs. Another objector, David Milne, has already been ordered to pay £15,000 in costs after losing a legal challenge against Mr Trump. Mr Milne, a retired teacher, said he was ""disgusted"" by the prospect of having to pay such a large sum of money. ""It's a disgrace,"" he said. ""I'm just an ordinary guy who was trying to stand up for what I believe in. I shouldn't be punished for that."" Mr Trump has defended his legal action against his opponents, saying he is entitled to protect his business interests. ""These people are trying to stop me from building a world-class golf resort,"" he said. ""I'm not going to let them get away with it."" The Scottish government is currently considering the objections to Mr Trump's plans. A decision is expected later this year. If the plans are approved, the Forbeses will be forced to sell their cottage and move out. They say they have no idea where they will go. ""We've lived here for 50 years,"" said Mrs Forbes. ""It's our home. We don't want to leave.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
City of Culture: Leicester 'disappointed but defiant',"A ""desperately disappointed"" Peter Soulsby congratulated Hull and said it perhaps needed the regeneration more. He said he had previously believed Leicester was not up for the bid but had been proved wrong in ""the most extraordinary way."" The ""heartbroken"" Labour leader said: ""I am proud of the campaign that we have run. We have made history in Leicester. When I started out, I didn't believe that Leicester was up for this bid. I have been proved wrong in the most extraordinary way. ""The people of Leicester have shown what wonderful, warm-hearted, delightful and aspirational people they are. We have come together as a city and as a county as never before. ""I wish Hull all the very best and I hope that this will indeed be the start of a renaissance for that great city. ""Hull clearly needed - perhaps more than we did - the regeneration, the renaissance and the boost that this title has brought. And I am absolutely certain that they will make a great job of it. I hope that they will take the crown with good grace and I wish them well."" Sir Peter, who admitted he felt ""heartbroken"" and ""let down"", said that despite not winning the contest, Leicester's campaign had brought the city together. He said: ""Let us stay together in this unity and this spirit of co-operation that we have found over this campaign period. We have shown what we can do. ""Let's resolve to go on and make this a better city, a great city for everybody to live in."" Leicester's bid featured plans for a huge Diwali festival, transforming the city into a ""beacon of light"" and a ""model of diversity"". There were also plans for a 120-metre high ""Helix"" sculpture, a seven-day ""River of Light"" festival, a new Shakespeare centre and a new ""cultural quarter"" in the city centre. The city's bid had the support of celebrities including Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri, comedian Ross Noble and Take That star Gary Barlow. It had also been backed by the county council and local businesses. Leicester's bid was one of six shortlisted for the title, alongside Hull, Dundee, Perth, Swansea Bay and the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft area. Hull was eventually crowned as the winner of the title, with its bid promising a ""once-in-a-lifetime transformation"" of the city.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ex-officers rehired: Case studies,"The PSNI said the appropriate place to discuss the detail of the report was with the Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee. Here are some case studies of ex-officers who were rehired: Case study 1 An officer was dismissed in 2012 for gross misconduct after being found to have engaged in sexual activity with a vulnerable person. The officer was rehired in 2014 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in a non-operational role. Case study 2 An officer was dismissed in 2015 for misconduct after being found to have used excessive force. The officer was rehired in 2016 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in an operational role. Case study 3 An officer was dismissed in 2017 for misconduct after being found to have breached the code of conduct. The officer was rehired in 2018 after appealing the decision. The officer is now working in a non-operational role. The PSNI said that all three of these officers were rehired after a thorough review of their cases. The PSNI said that it was satisfied that the officers had taken steps to address the issues that led to their dismissal and that they were now suitable to return to work. The Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee have both expressed concerns about the PSNI's decision to rehire these officers. The Policing Board has said that it is ""not satisfied"" with the PSNI's explanation for the rehirings. The Public Accounts Committee has said that it will be ""scrutinising"" the PSNI's decision-making process. The PSNI has defended its decision to rehire these officers, saying that it is committed to giving people a second chance. The PSNI has also said that it believes that these officers can make a positive contribution to policing in Northern Ireland. The issue of ex-officers being rehired is likely to continue to be a source of debate. The Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee are both likely to continue to press the PSNI for more information about its decision-making process.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Kent's festivals set to draw large crowds this summer,"By Andrew Parry BBC Kent In fact, we have more festivals than most down in the sunny south-east. From farms to parks, hills to zoos, no large space of land is safe from festival fever. Lounge on the Farm kicks off the main festival season in the county. Set in the beautiful surroundings of Merton Farm in Maidstone, it offers not only a great range of live music but also an array of street food and craft stalls. The week after Lounge, hip-hop will be taking over the Dreamland amusement park in Margate as part of Margate Soul Weekender. The three-day event will feature dozens of live acts, soul-star DJs, live art and street food. More music will follow just a week or so later at Folkestone Fringe, a scaled-down version of the town's much-loved Folkestone Book Festival, which takes place in the autumn. Music and comedy have always been a major part of Folkestone Fringe, but this year there will be plenty of other entertainment too, including science talks, nature walks and life drawing. If laughter is what you're after, then the Canterbury Festival is hosting a lineup of comedians as part of its annual month-long celebration of the arts. Taking place at venues across the city, the festival is once again promising a varied and exciting program of shows to suit all tastes. Not far from Canterbury is the small town of Tenterden, which is set to hold its first-ever Tenterden Folk Festival. Set in the beautiful gardens of Tenterden Recreation Ground, the one-day festival will welcome a variety of folk acts, as well as street food stalls and a real ale bar. This summer will also see the 20th anniversary of Hop Farm Festival. Taking place at the Hop Farm Country Park in Paddock Wood, it's one of the UK's biggest music festivals. This year's lineup includes acts such as McFly, The Fratellis and Rudimental. Away from the music, there will be comedy, street theatre, circus skills, family entertainment and a whole host of food stalls. And finally, for those who like their festivals with a touch of history, Dover Castle is hosting its first-ever Castle Concerts event. Taking place across three nights in August, the concerts will feature classical music, jazz and folk, with performances taking place in the castle's historic setting.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Sunday Times Rich List suggests UK's wealthiest defy recession,"The newspaper's research found the combined worth of the country's 1,000 wealthiest people is £414bn, up 4.7%. It means their joint wealth has passed the level last seen in 2008, before the financial crisis, and is 25% above its level a decade ago. The Sunday Times Rich List attributes much of the surge in wealth to the performance of the stock market during the pandemic, which has lifted the value of many businesses. The list's compiler, Robert Watts, said: ""The stock market has been the big driver this year. Those with big share portfolios have done very well indeed."" The biggest winner on the list is James Dyson, the inventor and owner of the eponymous vacuum cleaner company. His wealth has increased by £3.2bn to £23bn, making him the richest person in the UK for the first time. Dyson is followed on the list by brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, whose wealth has increased by £2.4bn to £21.5bn, and Sir Len Blavatnik, whose wealth has increased by £2.3bn to £20bn. The Sunday Times Rich List also highlights the growing wealth of those in the technology sector. The co-founders of online supermarket Ocado, Tim Steiner and Jason Gissing, have seen their wealth increase by a combined £1.3bn to £3.3bn. Meanwhile, the wealth of Alex Chesterman, the founder of property website Zoopla, has increased by £1bn to £2.5bn. Despite the overall increase in wealth, the number of billionaires in the UK has fallen from 171 last year to 147 this year. This is due in part to the falling value of sterling against other currencies, particularly the US dollar. The Sunday Times Rich List is a snapshot of the wealth of the UK's richest people at a particular point in time. It is important to note that wealth can fluctuate over time, and the rankings can change accordingly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'500 killed' due to medicine shortage,"In a letter to the Secretary of Health Ministry, Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi say that the region was not provided with much needed medicine. They say that due to this shortage, around 500 people have died in the last six months. The letter states that Kilinochchi Teaching Hospital alone records about 125,000 patients annually and it is estimated that about 30% of those patients are in need of life-saving medicines. However, the hospital has been facing a severe shortage of essential medicines for the past few months. The letter also says that the Mullaitivu General Hospital has also been facing a similar shortage of medicines, and as a result, many patients are being forced to travel to other districts to get the treatment they need. The Regional Directors of Health Services have urged the Health Ministry to take immediate action to address the shortage of medicines in the region. The Health Ministry has not yet responded to the letter. In a separate development, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) has also expressed concern about the shortage of medicines in the country. The SLMA says that the shortage is due to a number of factors, including the government's failure to pay its debts to pharmaceutical companies, the global economic crisis, and the war in Ukraine. The SLMA has called on the government to take immediate action to address the shortage of medicines, as it is putting the lives of patients at risk. The shortage of medicines in Sri Lanka is a serious problem that needs to be addressed segera. The government must take immediate action to ensure that all patients have access to the medicines they need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
University of Nottingham rent protesters offered 'support package',"Hundreds of University of Nottingham students called for rents to be suspended when they were unable to return due to national restrictions. Now the university has said support will be available to some. The university has announced a ""support package"" which will include a rent rebate for students who were unable to return to halls of residence during the November and December national lockdown and a hardship fund for those who are struggling to pay their rent. The rent rebate will be for the 11 weeks of the November and December lockdown and will be paid to students who were unable to return to halls of residence during that period. The hardship fund will be available to students who are struggling to pay their rent, regardless of whether they were able to return to halls of residence during the lockdown. The university said it had made the decision after listening to feedback from students and the Students' Union. The Students' Union said it welcomed the ""positive steps"" the university had taken but said it would continue to push for rent to be suspended for all students. The university said it was committed to supporting its students during the pandemic and would continue to monitor the situation and make changes to its support package as necessary. The announcement of the support package comes after months of campaigning by students for rent suspensions. In November, over 1,000 students signed a petition calling for rents to be suspended. The Students' Union also held a series of protests, including a rent strike. The university has said it hopes the support package will help students who are struggling financially during this difficult time. It is important to note that this support package is not available to all students.

Covid anxiety: Child 'asking if he's going to die',"By Sarah Easedale BBC Wales news Jane Griffiths, 47, said her four children had all been affected by the stress of the pandemic. ""My eldest two haven't shown any obvious signs of anxiety but our two youngest have been very affected,"" she said. ""My youngest says 'is it going to kill me?' and if I cough or sneeze he runs in fear."" Mrs Griffiths, from Mold, Flintshire, says they, like many families, have been through a lot of upheaval in the past year with all four children being off school for months and not seeing their friends. ""But I do also think there seems to be a lot of scaremongering out there about Covid and that has fuelled their fears,"" she added. ""My husband is a nurse and despite all the reassurances he gives them, they still worry."" Emma Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, is a single mum to nine-year-old Mia. She said her daughter - who has type 1 diabetes - had become very anxious during the pandemic, with her blood sugar levels rising as a result. ""Mia's blood sugar levels are usually very stable but when she started to get anxious we saw her blood sugars start to rise and we had to increase her insulin,"" she said. ""She's also started asking questions like 'mum, am I going to get Covid?' and 'am I going to die?' and it's heartbreaking as I'm trying to reassure her but also have to be mindful of not dismissing her concerns."" She added: ""I feel her anxiety has been fed by the media. I have a lot of friends who work in the NHS and I know it's been really tough but I don't think all of the reporting reflects that."" Dr Nicola Davies, consultant clinical psychologist for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said children's anxiety had been amplified by the pandemic. ""Many children and young people are anxious about the pandemic and how it's affecting their lives and those around them,"" she said. ""Some children may also experience physical symptoms such as stomach aches and headaches. It's important for parents and carers to take their child's worries seriously and to reassure them that they are safe."" Dr Davies said parents and carers can help children cope with anxiety by: Talking to them about their concerns and answering their questions honestly and reassuringly Helping them to develop coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques Limiting their exposure to news and social media about the pandemic Seeking professional help if their anxiety is severe or persistent If you are concerned about your child's mental health, you can contact your GP or local CAMHS team.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Power at Fukushima nuclear fuel ponds restored,"A power cut shut down cooling systems for four spent fuel ponds at reactors 1, 3 and 4 on Monday evening, although cooling was restored two hours later. This is the latest in a series of problems since the massive earthquake and tsunami of 2011 destroyed the plant's cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), said the power outage was caused by a fault with an electrical switch. A Tepco spokesman said the switch was damaged in the 2011 disaster and had been replaced, but still malfunctioned. He said the company was investigating the cause of the failure and working to prevent a recurrence. The ponds are not currently leaking and there is no immediate threat to the public, Tepco said. The ponds contain used fuel rods, which generate heat even after they have been removed from the reactors. The rods are covered with water to keep them cool and prevent them from overheating. If the water level were to drop too low, the rods could be exposed to air, which could cause them to catch fire. The power cut lasted for about two hours, and cooling was restored at all four ponds by 21:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Tepco admitted that it had allowed safety standards to slip in the months leading up to the 2011 disaster, which killed nearly 16,000 people. Following the 2011 disaster, the plant was closed and its operator, Tepco, has been struggling to decommission it. The plant is so badly damaged that it is expected to take decades to decommission, and the cost is expected to reach tens of billions of dollars. In the meantime, the vast majority of the plant's 26,000 spent fuel rods remain in cooling ponds, which are themselves vulnerable to earthquakes and other natural disasters. The power cut at the plant highlights the ongoing challenges of decommissioning the plant and the importance of ensuring the safety of the spent fuel rods.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Macedonia parliament votes to start name change process,"Two-thirds of the chamber - 80 of 120 deputies - backed the start of the process, the requisite majority to start the move. Several more votes will be needed before the changes can be ratified, including a public referendum. The move is the culmination of years of negotiations between Macedonia and Greece, which has long objected to its neighbour using the name Macedonia, arguing that it implies territorial claims over its own northern province of the same name. The agreement has been hailed by many as a major breakthrough in relations between the two countries, and could pave the way for Macedonia to join the EU and NATO. However, it has also been met with opposition from some Macedonians, who argue that it amounts to a betrayal of their national identity. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who has staked his political future on the deal, said it was a ""historic day"" for Macedonia. ""We are opening a new chapter in our history,"" he said. ""We are building a new future for our children."" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also welcomed the vote, saying it was a ""victory for Europe"". ""This is a historic day for our region,"" he said. ""We are overcoming the divisions of the past and building a better future for all our citizens."" The name change process is expected to take several months to complete. Once it is ratified by the Macedonian parliament and approved in a referendum, it will need to be recognised by the United Nations and other international organisations. The deal has been met with mixed reactions from the international community. The United States and the European Union have welcomed the agreement, but Russia has expressed concerns that it could lead to instability in the region. The name change process is likely to be a complex and challenging one. However, if it is successful, it could have a major impact on the future of Macedonia and the wider Balkans region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
What has the UK accomplished in Afghanistan?,"By Caroline Wyatt Defence correspondent, BBC News This has been the case since George Bush declared America's mission in Iraq over, under a banner that proclaimed 'Mission Accomplished'. The Taliban, Afghanistan's former rulers, seized control of much of the country again just 11 days after the US and UK finally withdrew their remaining 2,500 troops. The then US President Joe Biden said that America's mission was not to nation-build, but to ""take down al-Qaeda and to deal with terrorism"". And that, he insisted, had been achieved. The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the UK's aims in Afghanistan had been achieved too - they were to help the US with its counter-terror mission and to support the Afghan government and train the Afghan army. But while the US and UK have succeeded in removing the Taliban from power for 20 years - and in killing al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden - it is clear from the Taliban's swift return to power that there is still much that remains unfinished. What did the UK achieve in Afghanistan? The UK has been heavily involved in the US-led intervention in Afghanistan for the past two decades. The UK has deployed more than 45,000 troops to Afghanistan since 2001, and has spent more than £40bn on the war effort. The UK's main objectives in Afghanistan have been to: Help the US to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda Help to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan Train and support the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) The UK has made some progress in achieving these objectives. The Taliban was removed from power in 2001, and the UK has helped to build a number of schools and hospitals in Afghanistan. The UK has also trained and supported the ANSF. However, the Taliban has remained a potent force in Afghanistan, and the country has remained unstable. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 has raised questions about the long-term impact of the UK's intervention in the country. It is too early to say what the long-term impact of the UK's intervention in Afghanistan will be. However, it is clear that the UK has not achieved all of its objectives in Afghanistan. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan has been criticized by some. Critics argue that the UK's withdrawal has left a vacuum that the Taliban has been able to fill. They also argue that the UK's withdrawal has left the Afghan people vulnerable to the Taliban. The UK government has defended its decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. The UK government argues that the UK's objectives in Afghanistan have been achieved, and that it is now time for the Afghan people to take responsibility for their own country.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New prostate therapy recommended on NHS,"New prostate therapy recommended on NHS It's called prostate artery embolisation. And it blocks some of the blood supply to the prostate using tiny synthetic beads, causing the troublesome tissue to shrink and die. Officials say there is ""good evidence"" the new treatment can relieve symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate, such as problems urinating and needing to go to the toilet frequently. It is recommended for men who aren't suitable for surgery or other treatments, including medication. Prostate artery embolisation (PAE) is carried out under local anaesthetic, usually as a day procedure. A fine tube, called a catheter, is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded to the prostate. Tiny beads are then released into blood vessels supplying the prostate. The procedure takes about an hour and most people can go home the same day. Around a third of men over 50 experience problems urinating because of an enlarged prostate, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Symptoms include: needing to urinate more often, including at night difficulty starting to urinate a weak flow dribbling after urinating a feeling that the bladder isn't fully empty after urinating Most men with BPH can manage their symptoms with medication. But for those who don't respond to drugs, or who have side-effects, surgery has been the main option. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says PAE is a ""clinically and cost-effective option"" for these men. The health body said it was ""less invasive"" than surgery, and was associated with ""shorter hospital stays, less pain and fewer complications"". ""Around 75% of men treated with PAE report an improvement in their symptoms,"" Nice said. ""It is recommended for men for whom surgery is not an option or who prefer a less invasive treatment."" The treatment is not suitable for men with certain conditions, such as prostate cancer or a urinary tract infection. It is also not recommended for men with a very large prostate. PAE is also not yet widely available on the NHS, although Nice says it should be offered to all eligible men. The treatment costs around £2,500 privately. Prostate Cancer UK welcomed the recommendation, saying it was ""great news"" for men with BPH. ""For many men, medication is enough to manage their symptoms, but until now surgery was the only real alternative for those whose symptoms are severe or don't respond to drugs,"" said the charity's head of research, Dr Matthew Hobbs. ""PAE could offer a minimally invasive, day-case procedure that can significantly improve symptoms in many of these men, without the need for major surgery.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

China and US 'agree North Korea nuclear test measures',"Unnamed diplomats said a deal was agreed late on Monday and they hoped a draft resolution would be put to the Security Council for a vote on Tuesday. The new resolution is expected to limit North Korea's ability to import oil, ban its exports of textiles and impose sanctions on individuals and companies linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The text has yet to be released but, according to diplomats, the new measures would cut North Korea's crude oil imports by about one third. The country currently relies on China for nearly all of its oil, so cutting those imports would be a significant blow to its economy. The resolution would also ban North Korea from exporting textiles, which is one of its main sources of revenue. In addition, it would impose sanctions on individuals and companies linked to the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The agreement comes after months of negotiations between the US and China. China is North Korea's closest ally and has been reluctant to impose tough sanctions that could destabilize the regime in Pyongyang. However, Beijing has come under increasing pressure from the US and its other allies to take action following North Korea's recent nuclear and missile tests. The new resolution is expected to be met with resistance from North Korea, which has vowed to continue developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, diplomats said they hoped the measures would send a strong message to Pyongyang that its actions will not be tolerated. The agreement between the US and China is a significant breakthrough, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to deter North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests. Only time will tell how effective the new sanctions will be in curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Removing school bus chaperones in Birmingham 'dangerous',"Some pupils who used the free council bus service with guides to the Wilson Stuart School in Birmingham were told they would no longer have the same level of support and would have to make their own way to school. The decision to remove the chaperones was made by Birmingham City Council in a bid to save money. However, parents and pupils have expressed concerns about the safety of children having to travel alone. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""I'm really worried about my child having to get the bus to school on their own. They are only 11 years old and I don't think they are mature enough to do it safely."" Pupils have also expressed concerns, with one saying: ""I don't feel safe getting the bus to school on my own. There are often older children on the bus who bully me."" The council has defended its decision, saying that it is necessary to save money and that the pupils will be safe. A council spokesperson said: ""We understand that some parents and pupils are concerned about the removal of chaperones, but we believe that the pupils will be safe. We have carried out a risk assessment and we are confident that the pupils will be able to travel to school safely on their own."" However, the council's decision has been met with criticism from some quarters, with one councillor saying: ""I think it's a dangerous decision. I'm worried that children are going to get hurt.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rainfall not seen for a quarter of a century. ""It is certainly remarkable,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""The fact that it is the sunniest May on record is pretty exceptional because May is not normally a particularly sunny month, especially compared to June and July."" The extreme sunshine has been driven by a combination of high pressure and clear skies over the UK. And while the weather might have brought cheer for many, it has also heightened concerns about the impacts of climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1C since the industrial revolution, mostly as a result of human activities that emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. And climate scientists say that as the world continues to warm, the UK and other countries should expect further extremes in weather, with heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms becoming more frequent and severe. The Met Office says that ""under a high emissions scenario"", May's record sunshine could be the norm by the end of the century. ""If we don't do anything and we continue as we are, then what we would have perceived as extreme as the record sunshine in May could be our new normal,"" said Mike Kendon, a climate scientist at the Met Office. And it is not just in the UK that extreme weather events are occurring. A series of heatwaves in India and Pakistan have killed hundreds of people and have led to concerns about water shortages. While in the US, the state of California is battling its largest wildfire on record, which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the worsening climate crisis as ""a code red for humanity"". And he called on governments to ""sound the alarm"" and take urgent action to address the issue. The UK government is due to host a major UN climate summit in November, which is likely to be a battleground between countries that are demanding bolder action and those most resistant to change.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Trump aide Michael Flynn Jnr out after 'Pizzagate' tweets,"Michael Flynn, 33, left the US president-elect's transition team on Tuesday following his tweets about the so-called Pizzagate fake news story. His father, Michael Flynn Snr, Mr Trump's pick to be US national security adviser, has also shared viral Pizzagate content on social media. Pizzagate originated as a conspiracy theory that a Washington pizzeria was a front for a child sex trafficking ring run by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta. The theory spread widely on social media during the election campaign, and a North Carolina man travelled to the pizzeria in December and fired an AR-15 rifle inside, because he believed the conspiracy theory was true. Michael Flynn Jnr's Pizzagate tweets prompted the New York Police Department to post a warning on social media about the ""fictitious and unsubstantiated"" claims about child trafficking. The White House did not immediately comment on Michael Flynn Jnr's departure, but Mr Trump responded to the controversy on Twitter on Tuesday. He wrote: ""Michael Flynn Jr. - despite having an outstanding public record - is being treated very unfairly by the media. I failed to do a proper background check, therefore he is out."" Michael Flynn Jnr's departure marks the latest in a series of high-profile departures from Mr Trump's team. His chief strategist Steve Bannon, a key figure in the president-elect's inner circle, was forced to resign last week. Mr Trump's pick for labour secretary, Andrew Puzder, also withdrew his nomination on Tuesday. The controversies surrounding Michael Flynn Jnr and others have raised questions about Mr Trump's ability to staff his administration. He has repeatedly said he wants to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, but his picks for key positions have included several figures with controversial backgrounds.

Yardie actor on Idris Elba proposal: I had tears in my eyes,"By Hannah Moore Newsbeat reporter The 21-year-old has said he was already overwhelmed with emotion to be at the screening of Yardie - and that's before Idris made a special appearance. ""I was in the screening and it was a really emotional watch - I had tears in my eyes,"" said Aml Ameen, who plays the titular character D in the film. ""I remember turning around and seeing Idris standing at the back in a cap, so I thought: 'He's here, that's cool.' And then he was like, 'Come on stage.'"" After the screening, the audience was treated to a Q&A with Elba and the cast, where Elba revealed he'd asked Ameen to marry him. ""When he said that I just turned around and looked at him and I just kind of hugged him and said: 'Yes',"" Ameen told Newsbeat. ""We kind of joked about it on set. It wasn't like a serious thing, but then he did it and it was amazing. It was just so natural."" Elba and Ameen have known each other for years, having worked together on the TV series Luther. ""I'd always wanted to work with him and I always wanted to play a character that he created,"" said Ameen. ""I've been a fan of his for so long, so to actually work with him and then for him to be so gracious as to share this moment with me - it meant the world."" Yardie is a crime drama set in 1970s Kingston, Jamaica, and London. It follows the story of D, who travels to London to avenge his brother's murder. The film has been praised for its authentic portrayal of Jamaican culture and its exploration of themes such as violence, masculinity and redemption. Ameen said he was drawn to the role of D because of its complexity. ""He's a very layered character,"" he said. ""He's a very violent man, but he's also very loving and caring. He's a very complex character and I was really interested in exploring that."" Ameen said he hopes Yardie will resonate with audiences around the world. ""It's a very universal story,"" he said. ""It's about love, loss, redemption and family. I think it's a story that everyone can relate to.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Officials probe Missouri governor for 'blackmail and assault',"The spurned ex-husband of the woman, who has not been named in reports, secretly recorded her describing the otherwise consensual encounter. On Thursday, the man added that Mr Greitens had ""slapped her"" after she told him she had slept with another man. The House Special Investigative Committee on Oversight was convened to probe allegations of ""potential wrongdoing"" by Greitens. A spokesperson for the committee declined to provide details about the investigation. The woman filed for divorce from her husband in 2015, citing ""irreconcilable differences."" The woman sought and received a restraining order against her ex-husband in May 2016, alleging that he had physically abused her. In the divorce case, the woman's ex-husband alleged that his wife was having an affair with Mr Greitens. The woman, who was represented by an attorney, denied these allegations. The divorce was finalized in October 2016. In January 2017, Mr Greitens announced that he was running for Governor of Missouri. He was elected in November 2016. In March 2018, the woman's ex-husband released the audio recordings of his ex-wife describing her encounter with Mr Greitens to the media. The woman's ex-husband said that he released the recordings because he was concerned about Mr Greitens' behavior. In a statement, Mr Greitens called the allegations ""outrageous"" and ""false"" and said that he would ""not be extorted or blackmailed."" The allegations against Mr Greitens are the latest in a series of controversies that have plagued his administration. In April 2018, he was accused of misusing a charity for political purposes. He has also been criticized for his handling of a deadly tornado in Joplin, Missouri. The allegations against Mr Greitens have led to calls for his resignation. The Missouri House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry, and the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office is also investigating the allegations. Mr Greitens has denied any wrongdoing and has said that he will not resign. The investigation into the allegations against Mr Greitens is ongoing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jimmy Carr faces crowd after tax furore,"Carr has been widely condemned for taking part in a tax avoidance scheme. In response to a heckler who called him a ""tax dodger"", he replied: ""I've got to take that, I'm afraid. I've not paid tax for many years and there's nothing you can do about it. Get over it."" Carr's admission drew a mixed reaction from the audience. Some booed and hissed, while others laughed and applauded. One audience member shouted: ""You should be ashamed of yourself."" Carr has since defended his decision to use the tax avoidance scheme, saying that he did so ""entirely legally"". He has also said that he pays ""a lot of tax"" in other ways. However, his comments have been met with widespread criticism. Tax avoidance is a controversial issue in the UK, and many people believe that it is unfair for wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Carr's admission has also raised questions about the morality of comedians. Some people believe that comedians have a responsibility to use their platform to speak out against injustice, while others believe that comedians should not get involved in politics. Carr's decision to use the tax avoidance scheme is likely to continue to be debated for some time to come. It is a complex issue with no easy answers, and it is ultimately up to each individual to decide where they stand on the matter. In the meantime, Carr is continuing to perform his stand-up comedy shows. He is due to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this summer, and he is also set to embark on a UK tour in the autumn. It remains to be seen whether his tax avoidance admission will have any impact on his career. Only time will tell.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Files released on 1974 'Welsh Roswell',"There was a huge bang and a brilliant light over the Berwyn Mountains in north east Wales, and there were later claims a spaceship crash was concealed. Comparisons were drawn with Roswell, New Mexico, USA, in 1947, where it is alleged that alien bodies were recovered after a crash. The so-called ""Welsh Roswell"" incident took place in the early hours of 23 January 1974. Many people in the area reported seeing a bright light, some of whom also heard a loud bang. The incident was investigated by the police, who could find no evidence of a crash. However, some people believe that evidence of a crash was covered up by the authorities. In 2008, a new witness came forward to claim that he had seen a crashed spaceship being transported away from the Berwyn Mountains on the back of a low-loader. This witness, who has remained anonymous, said that he saw the spaceship being taken away from the mountains towards RAF Wrexham. The MOD has denied any involvement in the incident. However, some people believe that the MOD is still covering up the truth about what happened in the Berwyn Mountains in 1974. In 2014, a group of UFO researchers conducted an investigation into the Welsh Roswell incident. The group, known as the Welsh UFO Research Group, concluded that there was ""compelling evidence"" to suggest that a UFO had crashed in the Berwyn Mountains. The Welsh UFO Research Group based its conclusions on interviews with witnesses, as well as an examination of physical evidence. The group said that it had found ""pieces of metal and other debris"" that were ""consistent with the wreckage of a UFO."" The MOD has dismissed the findings of the Welsh UFO Research Group. However, the group's report has renewed interest in the Welsh Roswell incident. The Welsh Roswell incident remains one of the most famous UFO cases in British history. Despite the MOD's denials, many people believe that a UFO crashed in the Berwyn Mountains in 1974.

Amnesty calls for GCHQ spying inquiry,"It said it was ""outrageous"" that human rights bodies were being monitored. It came after the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) informed Amnesty that GCHQ had breached rules by keeping data intercepted from a secure communications network for longer than necessary. The tribunal ruled it had ""no doubt that the retention of the metadata for so long was incompatible with the law"". The tribunal's report follows a three-year legal battle by Amnesty to force the government to reveal the extent of its surveillance operations. Amnesty said the IPT's findings were ""deeply troubling"" and called for a full public inquiry into GCHQ's spying activities. ""It is outrageous that human rights organisations are being targeted by the British government,"" said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK's director. ""This is not just about Amnesty, this is about the right of all of us to privacy and to freedom of expression. ""The government must now come clean about the extent of its surveillance operations and establish an independent public inquiry into GCHQ."" The IPT's report found that GCHQ had intercepted communications between Amnesty staff and activists, and had stored the data for up to two years. The tribunal said that GCHQ had breached the law by keeping the data for so long, as it was only allowed to retain intercepted data for 60 days. The government said it was ""disappointed"" by the IPT's ruling, but accepted its findings. A government spokesman said: ""The Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled that GCHQ breached the rules in relation to the retention of metadata. ""We are disappointed by this ruling, but we accept it and have already taken steps to address the issue.

Oculus anti-piracy update cracked in a day,"The update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device. It also breaks an unofficial patch called Revive, which allowed users to play Rift-exclusive games on their HTC Vive or Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Within a day of the update's release, a group of hackers released a new version of Revive that bypasses the anti-piracy measures. The new version of Revive allows users to continue playing Rift-exclusive games on their non-Oculus headsets. The Oculus anti-piracy update is a significant development in the VR industry. It is the first time that a major VR headset manufacturer has implemented an anti-piracy measure. The update is likely to have a significant impact on the piracy of VR games, but it is unlikely to stop piracy altogether. The release of a cracked version of the update so quickly after its release is a testament to the skill and determination of the hacking community. It is also a reminder that no anti-piracy measure is foolproof. The Oculus anti-piracy update is a controversial development. Some users have praised the update, arguing that it is necessary to protect the VR industry from piracy. Others have criticized the update, arguing that it is too restrictive and that it will harm the VR community. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the Oculus anti-piracy update remains to be seen. It is likely that the update will reduce the piracy of VR games, but it is unlikely to stop piracy altogether.

Labour/Tory deal at Stirling Council ousts SNP,"Both parties said their priority would be balancing the local authority's books over the next two years. The deal comes despite the SNP returning nine councillors at last week's local election compared to Labour's seven and the Tories' six. The total number of seats in the chamber was reduced from 23 to 22 following boundary changes. Stirling Council is facing a financial challenge, having already made significant cuts to its budget in recent years. The new SNP/Tory administration is likely to continue this trend, as the council looks to reduce its reliance on government grants. The deal has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the move, arguing that it will bring stability to the council at a time of financial uncertainty. Others have criticised the agreement, saying it is a betrayal of the voters who elected the SNP as the largest party. The SNP has been in power in Stirling since 2007, but its support has declined in recent years. The party lost four seats at the local election, while Labour gained three and the Tories one. The SNP's vote share also fell by 4.4% to 34.9%. The SNP's losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the party's handling of the Scottish independence referendum and its performance in government. The party has also been criticised for its lack of focus on local issues. The Labour/Tory deal is a significant development in Scottish politics. It is the first time that these two parties have worked together in a formal coalition at a local level. It remains to be seen whether the deal will be successful, but it is a sign that the Scottish political landscape is changing. In the wake of the election, the SNP has pledged to continue to hold the new administration to account. The party has also said that it will be working to regain the trust of voters in Stirling.

The duchess started with the official opening of Te Papaiouru, a new $27 (£16.5m) museum in Wellington. The museum tells the story of New Zealand's democracy. It was built to mark 125 years since women won the right to vote in New Zealand. This gives the country a claim to being the first self-governing country in the world to give women the vote. Speaking at the event Meghan said: ""The achievements of the women of New Zealand 125 years ago was a resounding call to action - not just here in New Zealand but across the world."" These sentiments were echoed by her husband, who attended the ceremony with her. The couple also laid a wreath at the Kate Sheppard Memorial.

Thai Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn leads bike ride 'for Mom',"Wearing shirts in the queen's colour - sky-blue - and emblazoned with ""Bike for Mom"", the cyclists paraded through streets closed to traffic. Many Thais outside the capital were expected to gather for similar events. Bicycle clubs around the country, from Chiang Mai in the north to Songkhla in the south, held rides to show loyalty to the king's mother, who is a keen cyclist herself. Vajiralongkorn, the only son of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, is known for his love of cycling. He has competed in international events and often leads bike rides with the public. He wore sky-blue cycling gear, a helmet and sunglasses, and was surrounded by bodyguards as he waved to the crowds. The queen, 86, is revered by many Thais and is seen as a symbol of unity. She has been treated for several health issues in recent years. The bicycle ride was one of several events held to mark the queen's birthday, which falls on 12 August.

Rajar figures: Radio news listeners fall but boost for music shows,"Today's audience dropped by 839,000 year-on-year, while 5 Live Breakfast was down 337,000, according to Rajar, which monitors UK radio listening. The BBC said a quieter news agenda in the second quarter may have contributed to the fall, as there were fewer major breaking stories compared with the same period last year. Despite the drop in news audiences, there was a boost for music shows, with Radio 1's Breakfast Show with Greg James gaining 128,000 listeners. Radio 2's Breakfast Show with Zoe Ball also saw a rise of 94,000, while Scott Mills' show on Radio 1 gained 68,000 listeners. The figures show that commercial radio continues to grow, with Global's Heart remaining the UK's most popular commercial station, with a reach of 8.3 million. Bauer's Absolute Radio also saw a rise in listeners, with a reach of 5.2 million. The Rajar figures also show that podcast listening continues to grow, with a record 12.4 million people now listening to podcasts each week. The most popular podcasts include BBC Sounds' Newscast, Desert Island Discs, and Today in Focus. The Rajar figures are based on a survey of 59,000 people aged 15 and over, and are considered to be the industry standard for measuring radio listenership in the UK.

Culture secretary questions Edinburgh tourist tax plans,"The council says adding a £1 charge to hotel guests' bills could raise £11m to fund local services in Edinburgh. Leader Adam McVey posted on Twitter: ""Our plans for a transient visitor levy could raise an estimated £11m each year, which would be ring-fenced for new or improved local services to help tackle the additional visitor pressures our city faces."" However, the plans have been met with criticism from some in the tourism industry. ""The Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) last year called on the authority to abandon its proposed tourist tax after more than 500 hoteliers and hospitality businesses responded to a consultation,"" the BBC reports. ""The STA said the results showed 86% of businesses rejected the idea, with just 14% in favour of it."" Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government wants to ""understand the implications of a transient visitor levy"", but added that she has ""some concerns"".

""Edinburgh is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and we need to make sure that we don't do anything that would damage that."" Hyslop said she is ""also concerned about the impact on low-income visitors"". ""I think it's important that we have a fair and equitable system that doesn't disproportionately impact on those who are less well-off,"" she said. The Scottish government is currently considering a range of options for funding local services in tourist destinations.

ExpressTest's CEO, David Evans, said: ""We are delighted to be working with Edinburgh Airport to provide this new testing service. We believe that testing is essential for safe travel, and we are committed to providing our customers with fast, accurate and affordable testing options."" The opening of the screening site at Edinburgh Airport comes after the Scottish government announced a number of other measures to increase testing capacity for international travellers. These measures include: The launch of a new online booking system for PCR tests, which will allow passengers to book their tests in advance and avoid queues at airports. The expansion of testing capacity at Glasgow and Aberdeen airports. The introduction of new testing requirements for passengers arriving from countries with high levels of Covid-19. The Scottish government has also announced that it is working with the UK government to develop a new ""traffic light"" system for international travel. Under this system, countries will be placed on a red, amber or green list, depending on their Covid-19 risk level. Passengers arriving from red list countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while passengers arriving from amber list countries will be required to self-isolate at home for 10 days. Passengers arriving from green list countries will not be required to quarantine or self-isolate. The Scottish government has said that it is hopeful that the new testing and quarantine measures will help to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and support the safe restart of international travel.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Depression: 'Mindfulness-based therapy shows promise',"By Smitha Mundasad Health reporter, BBC News Scientists tested it against anti-depressant pills for people at risk of relapse and found mindfulness worked equally well. The study, in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, involved more than 200 people who had recently recovered from a depressive episode. Half of them practised mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) while the others took the antidepressant drug escitalopram, or a placebo. Over 24 months, they found 43% of those who received MBCT relapsed compared with 51% of those on escitalopram and 60% on placebo. Researchers said this meant it could offer people who are struggling with repeat depression a safe alternative to or work alongside medication. Lead author Prof Willem Kuyken, from Oxford University, said: ""MBCT looks to be an important additional treatment for depression relapse prevention. ""Currently there are few psychological treatments that are effective against depression relapse, and those that are can be time-consuming or not widely available. ""MBCT is a transdiagnostic treatment, meaning it can be used to treat and prevent all types of depression."" Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy MBCT is a form of psychotherapy that draws on the principles of mindfulness meditation but is adapted to be focused on depression. It involves group sessions where people sit, walk or lie still to learn how to focus their awareness on the present moment and process their emotions without judgment. Participants are also encouraged to practice mindfulness at home. Prof Kuyken said it was the first study to find MBCT was as effective as medication in preventing depression relapse, but added it was still too early to recommend MBCT as a first-line treatment for everyone with depression. He said: ""People at high risk of depression relapse are likely to prefer to take a pill once a day rather than practise mindfulness. ""But for those who don't want to take medication, or who have not had good experiences of medication, MBCT is a welcome new option."" Other experts said it was important to note the study did not compare MBCT against a talking therapy, so it was difficult to draw definite conclusions about its effectiveness. But Dr Carmine Pariante, a researcher from King's College London, said there was growing evidence that MBCT was effective in preventing depression relapse. ""This is welcome news as it provides an alternative option for people who do not want to take medication, or who have not found medication helpful,"" he said. ""It is also worth noting that MBCT is relatively easy to learn and deliver, so it has the potential to be widely accessible.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Hong Kong 'Umbrella' protesters sentenced to jail terms,"Four others received suspended sentences on Wednesday, while one had their sentencing deferred until June. The nine activists were found guilty earlier this month over their involvement in the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"" pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The movement, which called for greater democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, saw large-scale demonstrations and occupations of major thoroughfares. The nine activists were charged with offenses including conspiracy to commit public nuisance and incitement to unlawful assembly. Benny Tai, an academic and one of the leaders of the movement, was sentenced to 16 months in prison. Two other prominent activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were each sentenced to eight months in prison. The remaining six defendants received sentences ranging from six to eight months. The sentencing of the activists has been widely condemned by human rights groups and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. They argue that the sentences are politically motivated and intended to suppress dissent in the city. The Chinese government has defended the sentences, saying that the activists were convicted of serious crimes and that the sentences were proportionate to their offenses. The sentencing of the activists is likely to further polarize Hong Kong society and increase tensions between the city's pro-democracy movement and the Chinese government. It is also likely to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly in the city. The ""Umbrella Movement"" protests were sparked by the Chinese government's decision to restrict the number of candidates who could run for the city's top post in 2017. The protests lasted for 79 days and at their peak involved more than 100,000 people. The Chinese government has since cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, arresting a number of pro-democracy activists and introducing new laws that restrict freedom of speech and assembly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nearly 100 subsidised bus routes cut in Wales in 2011-14,"The figures obtained by BBC Wales reveal that nearly one in seven routes across 19 council areas have been axed. The charity Age Cymru warned of the impact this could have on older people, saying they could become increasingly isolated. ""A lot of older people rely on buses to access essential services such as health appointments, food shopping and social events,"" said Ian Thomas, Age Cymru's head of policy. ""If there is no bus service, it means people cannot get to these places and are more likely to be cut off from society."" The cuts have also been criticized by the Welsh government, which said they were ""unacceptable."" ""We are committed to improving public transport in Wales, not cutting it,"" said a spokesman for the government. ""We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that everyone has access to affordable and reliable bus services."" The cuts have been blamed on a number of factors, including government funding cuts and the rising cost of fuel. ""We are in a very difficult financial position and have had to make some tough decisions,"" said a spokesman for one council that has cut bus services. ""We have tried to protect the most essential services, but some routes have had to be axed."" The cuts have sparked protests from passengers and community groups. ""We are very angry about these cuts,"" said one protester. ""Buses are a lifeline for many people in our community and we are not going to let them be taken away."" The Welsh government has said it is working with local authorities to find ways to mitigate the impact of the cuts. ""We are exploring a number of options, including providing financial support to bus operators and working with community groups to develop new transport services,"" said a spokesman for the government. The cuts have also raised concerns about the future of public transport in Wales. ""These cuts are a symptom of a deeper problem,"" said one transport expert. ""The Welsh government needs to come up with a long-term plan for public transport that is affordable, reliable and sustainable.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cancer awareness 'low in black and South Asian groups',"By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News The study of nearly 50,000 people found those with a black ethnic background were least likely to have ever had a cancer screening, and men from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of some cancers. Overall, 67% of people in the UK have ever had a cancer screening (not including cervical screening). But the study found just 57% of black respondents had ever had a cancer check, compared with 69% of white respondents. For some cancers - such as testicular, prostate and lung cancer - awareness of the risks was much lower among black and South Asian men compared with white men. Dr Julie Sharp, head of health and patient experience at Cancer Research UK, said the findings showed ""clear disparities in cancer awareness between different ethnic groups"". ""This is concerning, as being aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer can lead to earlier diagnosis, and earlier diagnosis usually leads to better outcomes,"" she said. The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, looked at data from the Health Survey for England, which collected information on cancer screening and awareness from nearly 50,000 adults between 2018 and 2020. The researchers found that black respondents were less likely to have ever had a cancer screening than white respondents, even after taking into account factors such as age, sex, education and socioeconomic status. The study also found that men from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of testicular, prostate and lung cancer than white men. And women from South Asian backgrounds were less likely to be aware of the risks of cervical, breast and ovarian cancer than white women. Dr Sharp said the reasons for the disparities in cancer awareness were complex, but could include factors such as cultural beliefs, language barriers and a lack of trust in healthcare services. ""It's important to address these disparities so that everyone has the opportunity to be diagnosed with cancer at an early stage when treatment is more likely to be successful,"" she said. Cancer Research UK is calling for more to be done to raise awareness of cancer in black and South Asian communities, and to make sure that everyone has access to high-quality cancer screening and treatment services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Durham neo-Nazi teenager detained for terror attack plan,"The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named due to his age, guilty of preparing for an act of terrorism, possession of explosives and making threats to kill. The boy, who had been obsessed with Hitler and the Nazis, was first arrested in March 2019 when he was aged 15 after police raided his family home in Durham. They found a diary in which he had written about his hatred for black and Asian people and his desire to start a race war. He had also drawn up a list of targets for attacks, including schools, mosques, and synagogues. The boy's parents told police that he had become increasingly withdrawn and isolated in the months leading up to his arrest. He had spent hours alone in his room, playing video games and reading neo-Nazi material. He had also been attending meetings of a far-right group and had made threats to kill people online. In June 2020, the boy was convicted of preparing for an act of terrorism, possession of explosives and making threats to kill. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. The case of the Durham neo-Nazi teenager highlights the growing threat of far-right extremism in the UK. In recent years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of hate crimes committed against ethnic minorities and religious groups. The government has been accused of failing to do enough to tackle the problem. In light of the rise in far-right extremism, the BBC is launching a new series of investigative reports into the threat posed by white supremacists in the UK. The series will examine the factors that drive people to adopt far-right ideologies and will investigate the activities of far-right groups in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Safoora Zargar: Bail for pregnant India student blamed for Delhi riots,"She was more than three months pregnant when she was arrested in April. Police called her a ""key conspirator"" in anti-Muslim riots that swept Delhi in February. She is one of three Muslim women who are facing charges over the unrest, which left more than 50 people dead. All three women are accused of instigating violence, but they deny the charges. Safoora Zargar, a student at Jamia Millia Islamia University, was granted bail on Thursday by Delhi High Court. The court said that there was no evidence to support the charges against her. Her release was welcomed by activists and opposition politicians, who have accused the government of targeting Muslims in its crackdown on the Delhi riots. ""This is a victory for justice and for all those who have been fighting against the Modi government's draconian policies,"" said Umar Khalid, a prominent Muslim activist who was also arrested in connection with the Delhi riots. The government has defended its handling of the riots, saying that it is committed to ensuring that all those responsible are brought to justice. However, critics say that the charges against Safoora Zargar and the other two women are politically motivated. They point out that the government has not arrested any of the Hindu nationalists who are accused of inciting violence against Muslims. The Delhi riots were sparked by protests against a new citizenship law that was seen as discriminatory against Muslims. The protests quickly turned violent, with mobs of Hindu nationalists attacking Muslim homes and businesses. The government has been accused of turning a blind eye to the violence, and even of encouraging it. In the aftermath of the riots, the police have been accused of using excessive force against Muslims and of carrying out arbitrary arrests. The case of Safoora Zargar has become a symbol of the government's crackdown on dissent. She is a young, pregnant woman who has been accused of serious crimes based on little evidence. Her release on bail is a small victory, but it is a reminder that the fight for justice in India is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stanford rape case Judge Aaron Persky faces recall petition,"Community leaders from Santa Clara County filed a notice of intention on Monday to collect signatures to recall Judge Aaron Persky next year. Judge Persky was accused of bias in the sentencing of Brock Turner, a former Stanford University swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in 2015. The recall effort is being led by Recall Judge Aaron Persky, a group of community members who believe that Judge Persky's actions in the Turner case were ""unjust and biased."" The group has 160 days to collect 58,632 valid signatures from registered voters in Santa Clara County in order to force a recall election. If the recall effort is successful, Judge Persky would be the first California judge to be recalled since 1932. Judge Persky has defended his handling of the Turner case, saying that he followed the law and the evidence in making his sentencing decision. He has also said that he is ""deeply sorry"" for the victim's pain. The Turner case generated national outrage and led to widespread criticism of Judge Persky's sentencing decision. Many people felt that the six-month sentence that he gave Turner was too lenient. In response to the criticism, Judge Persky announced in June that he would not seek re-election when his term expires in 2022. The recall effort is the latest development in the ongoing fallout from the Turner case. The case has also led to changes in California law, including a new law that requires judges to consider the impact of sexual assault on victims when making sentencing decisions. The recall effort is expected to be contentious. Judge Persky's supporters argue that he is a fair and impartial judge who has been unfairly targeted by activists. His opponents argue that he is unfit to serve on the bench and that he should be removed from office. The recall election is scheduled to be held on June 7, 2022.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Muslim families sending children to Catholic schools,"By Sean Coughlan Education correspondent For the first time, an annual census of Catholic schools has collected information on the number of pupils from other religions. The biggest group of non-Catholic pupils are from other Christian denominations - but there are growing numbers of Muslims and Hindus. In England, there are around 2,300 Catholic schools, which educate about 10% of all school pupils. The census for 2022 shows that 83% of their pupils are now Catholic - down from 88% a decade ago. Of the remaining 17%, the biggest group are from other Christian denominations, such as Anglican or Methodist. But the number of Muslim pupils in Catholic schools is now 5%, up from 3% a decade ago. And the number of Hindu pupils is now 2%, up from 1% a decade ago. The growth in the number of non-Catholic pupils in Catholic schools reflects the changing demographics of England's population. According to the 2021 census, 46% of the population now identify as Christian, down from 59% a decade ago. The proportion of the population identifying as Muslim has increased from 4.9% to 6.5% over the same period. There are a number of reasons why Muslim families are choosing to send their children to Catholic schools. Some parents are attracted by the schools' strong academic record. Others appreciate the Catholic ethos of the schools, which emphasizes values such as compassion, service, and forgiveness. Some Muslim families also feel that Catholic schools provide a more welcoming environment for their children than non-religious schools. In a survey conducted by the Catholic Education Service, 80% of Muslim parents said that they felt their children were welcomed and respected in Catholic schools. The trend of Muslim families sending their children to Catholic schools is likely to continue in the years to come. As the Muslim population in England continues to grow, so too will the demand for schools that are both academically rigorous and welcoming to pupils of all faiths.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Isa Muazu: Nigeria to accept UK deportee's plane,"Isa Muazu was returned to the UK after a private jet chartered to take him to Nigeria on Friday was met with protests and demonstrations, forcing it to return to England. Muazu, a Nigerian national, was detained by the UK Home Office in November 2021 on immigration grounds and has been fighting to remain in the UK ever since. The Home Office said Muazu had ""no right to remain in the UK and has exhausted all legal avenues to do so"" and they intended to remove him to Nigeria. However, Muazu's supporters argued that the 53-year-old had been living in the UK for more than 30 years and considered it his home. Muazu had travelled to Nigeria in 2019 to visit his sick mother but was refused re-entry to the UK on his return after officials said he had overstayed his visa. His supporters believe he is the victim of a Home Office ""administrative error"" and they have been campaigning for his return. The Nigerian authorities have now agreed to accept Muazu, after initially refusing to cooperate. A spokesperson for the Nigerian High Commission in London said it had ""agreed to issue the necessary travel documents"" for Muazu. ""We are pleased that the Nigerian government has finally agreed to accept Mr Muazu's return,"" said Muazu's legal representative, Jacqueline McKenzie. ""This is a victory for common sense and compassion. Mr Muazu has been living in the UK for over 30 years and it is his home. He should never have been deported in the first place."" Muazu's return to the UK is expected to take place in the coming days. It is unclear whether he will face any further action from the Home Office.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Badger cull: Queen's Brian May praises Welsh government for halting plan,"The Queen guitarist and badger campaigner congratulated Environment Minister John Griffiths and said he had made a courageous decision. Mr Griffiths has opted to vaccinate the animals following a review. May, a patron of the Badger Trust, said the government had listened to science and accepted ""the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is the only humane and effective way to control bovine TB"". ""This is a momentous day for badgers and for the countryside,"" he said. ""I applaud the Welsh government for taking this bold step."" The badger cull has been a controversial issue in England, where it is used to try to control the spread of bovine TB. But there is no scientific consensus on whether the cull is effective, and there are concerns that it is cruel and inhumane. In 2019, the UK government announced that it would end the badger cull in England by 2025. But the Welsh government has said it will continue with its own cull, which is due to start in 2023. Mr Griffiths said he had decided to halt the cull after a review of the evidence. He said the review had found that vaccination was a more effective and humane way to control bovine TB. ""I have listened to the science and I have accepted the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is the only humane and effective way to control bovine TB,"" he said. ""I believe that this is the right decision for Wales and for the welfare of our badgers."" The decision to halt the badger cull has been welcomed by animal welfare groups. The RSPCA said it was ""delighted"" by the news. ""This is a victory for badgers and for common sense,"" said RSPCA Cymru chief executive Chris O'Brien. ""We have always maintained that culling is not an effective or humane way to control bovine TB, and we are pleased that the Welsh government has finally listened to the scientific evidence.""

Germany strikes explained: The long and the short of it,"This week's strikes could be the first of many. So why do they matter? And what do they say about Germany in 2018? We've boiled the long story short. This week, thousands of workers from various sectors in Germany have walked out in a series of strikes, causing major disruptions to public transport, schools, and other essential services. The short of it The strikes are primarily driven by demands for higher wages. High inflation and rising living costs have eroded the purchasing power of many workers. Trade unions, representing workers' interests, are negotiating with employers to secure better pay and benefits. Negotiations have reached an impasse, leading to the current strikes. The long of it Economic factors: The German economy is enjoying a strong period of growth, with low unemployment and rising wages. However, inflation has also been on the rise, outpacing wage growth in some sectors. This has led to a decrease in real wages and a squeeze on household budgets. Political factors: The strikes come at a time of political uncertainty in Germany, with the ruling coalition facing challenges and growing support for far-right and left-wing parties. The strikes could put pressure on the government to address economic concerns and inequality. Social factors: The strikes reflect a growing sense of frustration and dissatisfaction among many workers in Germany. They feel that the benefits of economic growth are not being shared fairly and that their voices are not being heard. What the strikes say about Germany in 2018 The strikes highlight several key trends and issues in contemporary Germany: Economic inequality: The widening gap between the rich and the poor is a growing concern in Germany, and the strikes are a reflection of that. Labor unrest: The strikes show that labor unions remain a powerful force in Germany, capable of mobilizing workers in large numbers. Political polarization: The strikes come at a time of political division in Germany, and they could further exacerbate tensions between the left and the right. What's next? The strikes are likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Negotiations between unions and employers will be closely watched, and the outcome will have significant implications for the German economy and society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Andrew Lloyd Webber: Arts at risk over austerity cuts,"Speaking at the House of Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber said the sector was being put at risk by policies introduced in the wake of the recession.

Lord Lloyd-Webber is one of 150 figures from the UK's theatre industry who have signed a letter to the government warning that the arts are ""on the brink of collapse"" because of soaring energy bills and other costs, while local authority spending cuts are also impacting them. The 150 signatories include stage and screen actors, theatre owners, directors and producers, as well as members of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre. They warn that the government cuts could have ""devastating consequences for an industry that contributes £111bn to the UK economy every year"". In a speech at the Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber said that the arts must be seen as an investment, not a luxury, adding that ""arts institutions and creative industries make our lives better and more beautiful"". The letter to the government argues that ""the energy crisis and cost of living crisis, alongside local authority funding cuts, threaten to decimate our theatres and arts organisations if more support isn't given."" The signatories call on the government to provide urgent support, including a review of business rates, a reduction in VAT on theatre tickets and the introduction of a ""theatrical investment relief"" tax credit to encourage investment in theatre productions. They also demand a ""freeze"" on local authority cuts to arts funding and an acknowledgement of the ""devastating impact"" reductions in spending are having on theatre and other art venues.

Insurers warn of travel premium rise,"By Simon Gompertz Personal finance correspondent, BBC News Drivers going on holiday could need also need extra paperwork, the Association of British Insurers said. Next Thursday, the UK leaves the European Union's single insurance market. This means that the Green Card - the document which proves your car is insured - will no longer be valid in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and Andorra. You can now buy a Green Card from your insurer to prove you have adequate cover. It will cost between £25 and £50. The insurance industry says most people will not need a Green Card, but there are some cases where it is essential. You must have a Green Card if you drive: to Ireland - as it is not part of the EU to Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo to any country that is not part of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and Andorra You might want to get a Green Card if you: are hiring a car abroad are driving near the borders of the countries not covered by the Green Card The ABI also warns the cost of travel insurance is likely to rise as the UK leaves the EU. EU rules mean that insurers can no longer ask customers where they come from when pricing their policies, or take into account previous claims history. This is likely to lead to higher premiums for British holidaymakers, because the UK is seen as a higher-risk country than many EU nations. ""We anticipate that prices will go up for UK residents,"" said the ABI's Matthew Maxwell Scott. The ABI is the trade body for the UK insurance industry. It represents around 200 insurance companies. Sarah Francis, from the travel insurance comparison website TravelSupermarket, said: ""Holidaymakers should expect to pay more for travel insurance when travelling to the EU. ""The ABI are warning of a 6% increase in the cost of travel insurance when travelling to Europe this summer."" The ABI says the increase in premiums is likely to be modest. But Mr Maxwell Scott said: ""There is likely to be a widening of the differential between the prices of travel insurance for EU and non-EU destinations."" He added: ""It is more important than ever that holidaymakers shop around for the best deal on their travel insurance, and make sure they have adequate cover. ""They should also remember that they may need a Green Card to drive in some countries.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The FPOe's rise was not unexpected - the party has been on the rise for some years, and has been predicting that the mainstream parties would lose support. It is not yet clear how the FPOe will behave in parliament, but it could be more disruptive than at any time since it entered parliament in 1999. The Freedom Party leader, Norbert Hofer, said on Monday that the party's advance was a ""great mandate"" for the party. He said the FPOe had won support from ""those who want to regain power in this country"". He added that the party was not interested in governing ""at any price"": ""Personally I would prefer to be in opposition. But I will certainly not participate in a government that works against our values."" The FPOe is opposed to same-sex marriage, immigration, and multiculturalism, among other things. It wants to leave the European Union, and hold a referendum on whether Austria should leave the eurozone. The FPOe's rise has been blamed on a number of factors, including: The public's dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the immigration crisis The country's economic problems The rise of populism across Europe It is unclear whether the OeVP and SPOe will be able to form a stable government. The two parties have very different views on a number of issues, and it is possible that they could clash over policy. The OeVP is more pro-European than the SPOe, and it is more likely to support austerity measures. The SPOe is more left-wing, and it is more likely to support social welfare programmes. If the OeVP and SPOe cannot form a coalition, it is possible that the FPOe could end up in government. This would be a major shift in Austrian politics, and it could have a significant impact on the country's future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cilla Black encouraged me to be an actress - now I'm playing her on stage,"Hayworth followed her instruction. Now 28, she has won her first major role appearing as the star on stage. She will play the late singer and TV host in Cilla The Musical, which opens in August in London. Cilla Black, who died in 2015, was a national treasure, and was known for presenting the TV shows Blind Date and Surprise, Surprise. Hayworth will play Black through the various stages of her career, from her early days as a singer in the 1960s, through to her success as a TV star in the 1970s and 1980s. The musical will also feature Black's relationship with her husband, Bobby Willis. Hayworth was born in Liverpool, where Black grew up, and says she ""has the same accent and mannerisms"" as the star, who was known for speaking her mind and her infectious laugh. ""I'd been told I was like her and I remember watching Cilla Black on TV and thinking she exuded warmth and fun, and she was very strong and independent. I felt like I could relate to her on that level,"" says Hayworth. Despite the similarities, Hayworth was determined to create her own interpretation of Black. ""I wanted to find Cilla's vulnerability and her struggles, because she had a lot of those as well. This role has been a really nice challenge."" Hayworth was cast after a long audition process, which involved singing, dancing, and acting. ""I sang one of Cilla's songs, Anyone Who Had A Heart, and I performed a monologue that told her story,"" she says. ""I had to do a lot of research to really understand her - reading her autobiography and watching lots of YouTube videos. I wanted to get the full picture of who she was."" Hayworth says ""it has been a huge privilege to play such an iconic figure"". ""Cilla was loved by so many people, and I hope I can do her story justice,"" she says. Cilla The Musical will run at the Lyric Theatre, London, from 25 August 2023 to 6 May 2024.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Homebirths to restart with new safeguards,"The arrangement in the Lothians includes a limit of one birthing partner and the need for a separate changing space for them to get into personal protective equipment (PPE). Homebirths currently account for 2% of births in Scotland. The Scottish government said it aimed to get this back to pre-pandemic levels of 5% to 10%. The Royal College of Midwives said homebirths were a ""safe choice"" for many women. The new guidelines were published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). They include advice on how to protect against Covid-19, such as wearing face masks and washing hands regularly. The guidelines also recommend that women should have a birth plan in place that includes their preferences for pain relief and where they would like to give birth. The RCOG said that homebirths were a ""safe and effective"" option for many women. The college said that there was no evidence to suggest that homebirths were more risky than hospital births. The RCM said that homebirths were a ""positive and empowering"" experience for many women. The college said that homebirths could help to reduce the number of interventions, such as episiotomies and Caesarean sections. The Scottish government said that it was committed to providing women with a choice of where to give birth. The government said that it would continue to work with the NHS to ensure that women had access to safe and high-quality maternity care. The new guidelines are likely to be welcomed by many women who are planning to give birth. Homebirths can offer a number of benefits, including: A more relaxed and comfortable environment Reduced risk of interventions Greater control over the birth process If you are considering a homebirth, it is important to talk to your midwife or doctor to discuss the risks and benefits. You should also make sure that you have a birth plan in place that includes your preferences for pain relief and where you would like to give birth.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Unions call for end to local authority pay freeze,"Unison, Unite and the GMB have lodged their annual pay claim, saying a ""living wage"" of £7.20 an hour should be brought in. They want to see a 1% pay rise for all staff and a minimum wage of £7.20 for all local authority workers. The unions say that the pay freeze has had a ""devastating"" impact on local authority workers, who have seen their wages fall in real terms by 20% since 2010. They say that many workers are now struggling to make ends meet, and that the pay freeze is making it difficult for local authorities to recruit and retain staff. The unions are calling on local authorities to end the pay freeze and to invest in their workforce. They say that a pay rise would boost the local economy and help to improve public services. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, said that it was ""disappointed"" by the unions' pay claim. The LGA said that councils are facing ""significant financial pressures"" and that they cannot afford to give their staff a pay rise. The LGA said that it was ""committed to working with the unions to find a fair and affordable settlement"" but that it could not ""promise to meet the unions' demands in full"". The unions have said that they are prepared to take industrial action if their demands are not met. They have warned that they could call a strike ballot of their members if the LGA does not agree to end the pay freeze. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010, when the government imposed a 1% cap on public sector pay rises. The government says that the pay freeze is necessary to reduce the national deficit. The unions say that the pay freeze is unfair and that it is having a devastating impact on public sector workers. They say that the government should end the pay freeze and invest in its workforce.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Greece 'may need 10bn euros more' in aid - Stournaras,"Yannis Stournaras said: ""If there is need for further support to Greece, it will be in the order of about 10bn"". The comments come after the Greek government and its creditors reached an agreement on the terms of a third bailout. The deal is expected to provide Greece with up to €86bn in loans over the next three years. However, Stournaras said that the country may need additional funding if it is to meet its fiscal targets. He said that the Greek government is committed to reducing its budget deficit and debt, but that it may need help from its creditors to do so. ""We are committed to meeting our targets, but we may need some additional support,"" he said. Stournaras' comments suggest that the Greek government is not confident that it can meet its fiscal targets without further assistance from its creditors. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned that Greece may need additional funding, and has said that it is not prepared to provide any more loans to the country until it sees evidence that the Greek government is committed to reforms. The Greek government has been under pressure from its creditors to implement a series of reforms in order to reduce its budget deficit and debt. These reforms include cuts to public spending, tax increases, and reforms to the labour market. The Greek government has agreed to implement these reforms, but it is unclear whether it will be able to do so without causing social unrest. The country has already seen a number of protests against the austerity measures that have been implemented in recent years. If the Greek government is unable to implement the reforms that it has agreed to, it may find itself in need of additional funding from its creditors. This could lead to a further deterioration in the country's economic situation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Crossing Divides: Do you live in a social bubble?,"We asked people in an international poll how they felt about their choice of friends. See how you compare in our interactive quiz: The results of the survey, conducted among people with internet access across 27 countries, suggested that many of us feel we live in social bubbles. The findings were published in the journal 'Nature Human Behaviour'. They revealed that on average, people estimated that around half of their friends were like them in terms of their political views. This was true even in countries with a high degree of political polarisation, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The researchers also found that people were more likely to be friends with people who were similar to them in terms of their age, education, and income. This suggests that we tend to associate with people who share our social and economic status. The findings of this study are important because they highlight the potential for social bubbles to reinforce existing biases and make it more difficult for us to see the world from different perspectives. So, what can we do to break out of our social bubbles? One way is to make a conscious effort to meet people who are different from us. This could involve joining a club or group that focuses on a topic that you're interested in, or volunteering your time to a cause that you care about. Another way to break out of your social bubble is to travel to different countries and cultures. This will expose you to new ideas and ways of life, and help you to see the world from a different perspective. Finally, it's important to be open to new experiences and to challenge your own beliefs. This doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that everyone else says, but it does mean being willing to listen to other people's opinions and to consider their perspectives. Breaking out of our social bubbles can be challenging, but it's important to remember that we all have something to learn from each other. By making an effort to meet people who are different from us, we can broaden our horizons and become more understanding and tolerant individuals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Mayor considers Hoo peninsula in Kent as airport option,"Mr Johnson wants to increase flight capacity around London without expanding Heathrow. He has also been considering building an airport in the Thames Estuary to the east of the city. The Hoo peninsula is located in Kent, to the south-east of London. It is sparsely populated and has good transport links to the capital. The peninsula has been suggested as a potential site for an airport for many years. In 2014, a report by the Airports Commission concluded that the Hoo peninsula was one of the most feasible options for a new airport in the South East. However, the government ultimately decided to expand Heathrow instead. The Mayor of London's interest in the Hoo peninsula has reignited the debate about the need for a new airport in the South East. Supporters of a new airport argue that it is needed to meet the growing demand for air travel. They also say that it would create jobs and boost the economy. Opponents of a new airport argue that it would damage the environment and increase noise pollution. They also say that it is not needed, as there is already sufficient airport capacity in the South East. The government has not yet made a decision on whether to build a new airport in the South East. However, the Mayor of London's interest in the Hoo peninsula is likely to put pressure on the government to reconsider its options. If the government does decide to build a new airport in the South East, the Hoo peninsula is likely to be one of the frontrunners. It is a well-connected site with good transport links to London. However, there are also environmental concerns that need to be considered. The decision of whether or not to build a new airport in the South East is a complex one. There are a number of factors that need to be considered, including the environmental impact, the economic benefits, and the need for additional airport capacity. The government will need to weigh all of these factors carefully before making a decision.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: People 'have got the message' and stayed home,"The Welsh Government responded by imposing severe curbs on people's lives, with fines for disobeying. It came after thousands of people had flocked to beauty spots in the first weekend after the lockdown was announced. But this weekend, things were very different. The streets were largely deserted, and the few people who were out were keeping their distance from each other. The same was true across the UK. In England, the government had advised people to stay at home over the long Easter weekend, and most people had heeded the advice. The roads were quiet, and the parks were empty. It seems that the public has finally got the message about the importance of social distancing. After weeks of mixed messages from the government, it is clear that people now understand the need to stay home to save lives. This is a major breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus. If people continue to follow the advice, it will help to slow the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. However, it is important to remember that the virus is still out there, and we must not become complacent. We must continue to stay home, wash our hands regularly, and avoid contact with others. The government has said that the lockdown will continue for at least three more weeks. This may seem like a long time, but it is important to remember that it is for our own good. By staying home, we are helping to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and the NHS. We can get through this together. By following the advice, we can help to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives. The BBC has been reporting on the coronavirus pandemic since it began.

Bat virus clues to origins of Sars,"By Keeren Flora BBC Radio Science Unit Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats which are closely related to the pathogen that infects humans.  The viruses are the closest relatives yet found to the one which caused the Sars outbreak in 2002-03, but differ from the virus that is now circulating and causing Covid-19. The discovery suggests that the original Sars virus may have originated in horseshoe bats, and jumped into humans via an intermediary animal. The two new viruses, named RmYN02 and RmYN05, were found in bats from Yunnan province in southern China. They were identified by researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who compared their genetic sequence to that of the original Sars virus. The findings have been published in the journal Nature Microbiology. The researchers say that the two new viruses are 96% and 97% identical to the original Sars virus, respectively. This suggests that they are closely related, and may have evolved from a common ancestor. However, the two new viruses are not identical to the original Sars virus. They have some small genetic differences, which means that they are not able to infect human cells in the same way. The researchers say that this suggests that the original Sars virus may have evolved from a common ancestor of the two new viruses, and then changed slightly over time. They believe that the two new viruses may have been circulating in horseshoe bats for some time, and that they may have jumped into humans via an intermediary animal. The researchers say that their findings provide important clues about the origins of the Sars virus, and could help to prevent future outbreaks. They say that their work highlights the need for further research into the viruses that circulate in bats, and the potential risks that they pose to humans. The Sars outbreak in 2002-03 caused widespread alarm, and led to the deaths of more than 700 people. Since then, there have been several other outbreaks of Sars-like viruses, including the current Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers say that their findings could help to develop new vaccines and treatments for Sars-like viruses, and could help to prevent future outbreaks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Alex Salmond launches £103m renewable energy fund,"The Renewable Energy Investment Fund (REIF) aims to attract more private investment to the sector. Its priorities include wave and tidal energy, and renewable district heating. Mr Salmond also announced plans to set up an expert taskforce to advise the Scottish government on the next steps toward achieving its renewable energy ambitions. The taskforce will be led by Professor Sir Jim McDonald, the principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Strathclyde, and will include representatives from industry, academia, and the public sector. It will advise the government on how to develop the right policy and regulatory framework to support the growth of the renewable energy sector, and how to ensure that Scotland remains at the forefront of this global industry. Mr Salmond said: ""Scotland has the potential to be a world leader in renewable energy, and the Renewable Energy Investment Fund will help us to unlock that potential.

Twitter abuse and bomb threat claims probed by police,"The Met said its central e-crime unit would investigate the claims, including three that were made outside London. On Wednesday, four female journalists, a student and a member of the public reported receiving threatening messages, including bomb threats. The threats were made in response to an article published in the Times newspaper about a former MP's alleged sexual harassment. The journalists were all women who had written about the allegations against the former MP. The student was a young woman who had tweeted about the article. The member of the public was a man who had also tweeted about the article. The Met said in a statement: ""We are aware of a number of reports of threatening messages being sent to journalists, a student and a member of the public. These messages are being investigated by our central e-crime unit."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) condemned the threats, saying that they were ""an attempt to intimidate and silence journalists who are doing their job."" The NUJ's general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: ""These threats are a reminder of the dangers that journalists face in the course of their work. We stand with our members and will not be intimidated by those who seek to silence us."" The threats come at a time when there is growing concern about the level of abuse and intimidation faced by journalists online. A recent survey by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) found that nearly two-thirds of female journalists have experienced online abuse. The IFJ's general secretary, Anthony Bellanger, said: ""Online abuse and intimidation are a serious threat to freedom of expression. We urge governments and social media companies to take action to protect journalists from these attacks."" The Met's investigation into the threats is ongoing.

Liberia warlord 'Jungle Jabbah' jailed for 30 years in the US,"Mohammed Jabbateh was found guilty of immigration fraud for falsely telling US authorities in the 1990s that he had never belonged to an armed group. One of the most notorious figures of the Liberian civil wars, Jabbateh - known as ""Jungle Jabbah"" - was jailed for 30 years in a US court in 2018. Jabbateh has always denied any role in the atrocities which took place during the two Liberian civil wars, from 1989-96 and 1999-2003, each of which claimed the lives of an estimated 250,000 people. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia (TRC) found Jabbateh personally responsible for the massacre of more than 1,000 civilians during the first war. The TRC report alleges that Jabbateh recruited and trained child soldiers and ordered the ritualistic cannibalism of civilians. In 2001, Jabbateh was offered asylum in the US after being resettled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He did not disclose his past and was granted permanent residency in 2003. An indictment in 2016 charged Jabbateh with committing crimes in Liberia, including acts of murder, forced labour and the use of child soldiers. He was extradited from the US to Liberia in 2017, but the Liberian authorities failed to prosecute him and returned him to the US to face trial. The US trial focused on Jabbateh's immigration status. Prosecutors argued that he had lied on his asylum application, resulting in his acquiring citizenship which he was ineligible for. Jabbateh claimed he concealed his past to protect himself and his family. The jury found Jabbateh guilty of perjury and fraud and he was sentenced in 2018 to 30 years in prison. The presiding judge, Richard Gergel, said Jabbateh's crimes ""went beyond mere deceit"" and that he had committed ""heinous atrocities that shocked the conscience"". Jabbateh's case has drawn attention to the challenges of prosecuting war crimes in a country where the perpetrators live alongside their victims, and the importance of accountability for atrocities committed during civil wars.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan rules out offensive against Punjab militants,"By M Ilyas Khan BBC News, Islamabad His remarks came hours after he told a parliamentary committee that ""Punjabi Taliban"" were entrenched in southern parts of Punjab. Mr Sharif said they were behind recent attacks in Punjab's Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. Recent attacks in the province have killed more than 100 people, including police officers and civilians. The Taliban are a banned militant group that was set up in Afghanistan in the 1990s with the support of Pakistan. After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, many members returned to Pakistan. They have since regrouped and claimed responsibility for numerous attacks across the country. While the Pakistani government has launched major offensives against the group in other parts of the country, including the north-western tribal region of Waziristan, it has held back from doing so in Punjab. Some analysts believe that the government is reluctant to launch a full-scale operation in Punjab because it does not want to alienate the province's powerful feudal lords, many of whom are believed to have links to the Taliban. Others argue that the government is concerned that a military operation in Punjab could lead to a wider conflict. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said that the government had been ""successful in containing"" the threat from the Punjabi Taliban. He said that the group had been ""degraded"" and that its ""capacity to carry out terrorist attacks has been significantly reduced"". However, he also acknowledged that the group remained a ""threat"" and that the government would continue to take ""stern action"" against it. Mr Sharif's speech was welcomed by some analysts, who said that it showed that the government was serious about tackling the threat from the Punjabi Taliban. However, others were more sceptical. They argued that the government had been talking tough on the Punjabi Taliban for years, but had failed to take any concrete action against them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Havelock House: Residents welcome rejection of demolition plans,"The building, on lower Ormeau Road, was vacated in 2018 ahead of a UTV move to new offices on City Quays. London company Olympian Homes bought the site with plans to knock it down and build around 145 apartments. However, Belfast City Council's planning committee rejected the application, following a public consultation that saw 119 objections and one representation in support. The Twentieth Century Society welcomed the decision, saying it was an ""important step in the right direction"". ""This is potentially a landmark case,"" said the society's director Catherine Croft. ""Havelock House is a key part of Belfast's architectural heritage. It is a striking building that gives the city a distinctive character.

Dog's dinner: DNA clue to how dogs became our friends,"By Helen Briggs BBC News Our canine companions developed the ability to digest starchy foods during the farming revolution thousands of years ago, according to DNA. This helped them scavenge more effectively for human scraps and may have been key to their domestication. The results, published in Nature, suggest that genetic changes in dogs since wolves became our pets were heavily influenced by the changing diets of humans. Scientists at Uppsala University in Sweden analysed DNA from hundreds of ancient and modern wolves, dogs, and foxes. They found that dogs developed a new gene variant after they became domesticated that helped them digest amylase - a starch-digesting enzyme found in saliva. The emergence of this gene is thought to have coincided with the advent of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. Farming led to a shift in the human diet towards more plant-based foods, which produced a change in the types of food scraps available to dogs. ""Around this time, dogs would have been hanging around humans and scavenging for scraps,"" said Prof Peter Savolainen, part of the research team. ""Starch was a new type of food for them, so the selective pressure to adapt to this food source may have been essential for their survival."" The study found a high frequency of the starch-digesting gene variant in dogs from East Asia, the region where rice farming first began. The scientists believe that dogs from this region then spread the gene to other dog populations around the world. The findings have implications for modern pet dogs, many of whom are fed a diet that is still relatively high in starch. And just like our early canine companions, modern dogs still seem to have a sweet tooth for starchy treats. ""I know lots of dogs who love bread,"" said Prof Savolainen. ""And although it's not great for their health, I think it's something that reflects their genetic interest in starches."" The study also found that dogs developed other genetic changes since they diverged from wolves, including changes that affect their body size, behaviour, and disease susceptibility. These changes may have resulted from ongoing natural selection, artificial selection by humans, or a combination of the two. ""Our results provide strong evidence that dogs have evolved in response to changes in the human diet,"" said Prof Savolainen. ""This highlights the close relationship between humans and dogs, and the role of diet in this relationship.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
South East hospitals charged £1.5m for ambulance delays,"Patient handovers should not take longer than 15 minutes. Hospitals are charged £2.44 for each extra minute. Jonathan Fox, from the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, told the BBC the charges were ""nothing new"" but said the data highlighted the ""severity, scale and cost to the NHS of handover delays"". The data, released under freedom of information laws, show how much each NHS trust paid to South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) in 2021-22 for delayed handovers.  King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London was charged the most - £443,326.48 - followed by Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust which paid £345,617.44 and St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which was charged £297,940.80. Of the 28 trusts covered by SECAmb, only two were not charged in 2021-22. These were the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust and the Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust, which is responsible for community health services rather than acute hospital care. The data also reveals the wide variation in charges between trusts. For example, in March 2022, the Princess Royal University Hospital NHS Trust was charged a total of £105,059.04 while Medway NHS Foundation Trust was charged just £3,332.96. A spokeswoman for SECAmb said the trust was ""committed to working with our NHS partners to improve handover times and ensure that our patients receive the best possible care"". She said: ""We have invested significantly in our ambulance service, including increasing staff numbers and introducing new vehicles and technology. We are also working closely with NHS trusts to improve handover processes and reduce delays."" The charges for delayed handovers are part of a national scheme introduced in 2017 to improve patient flow through A&E departments. The scheme is designed to encourage hospitals to improve their handover processes and reduce the amount of time that patients spend waiting in ambulances. The charges are paid by hospitals to ambulance services. The money is then used to fund ambulance services, including staff costs, vehicles and equipment.

New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague,"The former foreign secretary warned of the risk of a ""hate-filled"" campaign if the government attempted to revisit the issue and tell people ""they got it wrong"". He suggested that the government should focus on other issues, such as cost of living and climate change. ""We need to talk about real issues, not repeat referendums,"" he said. Hague's comments come amid growing speculation that Prime Minister Liz Truss could call a new referendum on Brexit. Truss has said she is ""not ruling out"" a second referendum, but has also said that she wants to focus on ""delivering"" Brexit. However, a new poll suggests that the public is divided on the issue of a second referendum. The poll, conducted by YouGov, found that 42% of Britons would support a second referendum, while 38% would oppose it. The poll also found that support for a second referendum is highest among young people, with 54% of 18-24 year-olds saying they would support it. The issue of a second referendum is likely to continue to be debated in the coming months, as the government faces pressure from both sides of the Brexit divide. Meanwhile, the leader of the Liberal Democrats has said that he would support a second referendum if it were ""the only way"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Sir Ed Davey said that he would prefer to see the government negotiate a new deal with the EU, but that he would ""not rule out"" supporting a second referendum if necessary. ""If it is the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit, then I would support a second referendum,"" he said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
MSPs back Scottish smacking ban proposals,"A bill lodged by Green MSP John Finnie is designed to give children the same protection from assault as adults. It would repeal the common law defence of ""justifiable assault"" for parents and carers, which currently allows them to use ""reasonable"" physical punishment on children. The bill has the backing of the Scottish government and is likely to be passed by the Scottish Parliament. If it becomes law, Scotland will become the first country in the UK to ban smacking. Supporters of the ban say it is necessary to protect children from physical abuse and to promote positive parenting. They argue that smacking is ineffective as a form of discipline and can damage children's physical and mental health. Opponents of the ban say it is a step too far and that it will criminalise parents who use reasonable physical punishment. They argue that the law should not interfere in family life and that parents should be allowed to discipline their children as they see fit. The debate over smacking is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and it is likely to continue for many years to come. However, the Scottish government has made it clear that it believes that a ban on smacking is necessary to protect children from harm. If the bill is passed, it will send a clear message that smacking is not acceptable in Scotland. It will also help to change attitudes towards physical punishment and promote positive parenting. In addition to the bill lodged by John Finnie, there is also a separate campaign to ban smacking in Scotland. The campaign is led by the group Children 1st, which is calling for a public consultation on the issue. Children 1st argues that a ban on smacking would send a strong message that violence against children is unacceptable. It would also help to change attitudes towards physical punishment and promote positive parenting. The campaign has the support of a number of organisations, including the Scottish Children's Commissioner, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and the Royal College of Nursing. The Scottish government has said that it will consider the findings of any public consultation on smacking before making a decision on whether to introduce a ban. However, the government has also made it clear that it believes that a ban on smacking is necessary to protect children from harm. It is likely, therefore, that the government will introduce a ban if it receives public support for doing so.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Algerian army 'kills jihadist behind Herve Gourdel beheading',"Abdelmalek Gouri and two associates were shot dead late on Monday in the town of Isser, a statement said. His group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), pledged allegiance to Islamic State. The army said he was killed in an ambush after the three men refused to surrender. Gourdel, a 55-year-old mountain guide, was taken hostage in the mountains east of Algiers on 21 September. He was featured in a video released a week later by his captors, who threatened to kill him if France did not halt air strikes in Iraq. France refused and on 24 September the militants released another video showing Gourdel's severed head. President Francois Hollande described the killing as ""a barbaric act"" and said France would ""continue to fight terrorism"". The French air force has stepped up its strikes on Islamic State in Iraq since Gourdel's death. Jund al-Khilafa is believed to have only a few dozen members and is one of several small Islamist groups operating in Algeria. The group emerged in 2014 and is led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran jihadist who was involved in the 2013 siege of a gas plant in eastern Algeria that killed 40 people. Belmokhtar's group is based in southern Libya and has been linked to several attacks in Algeria and neighboring Mali. The Algerian army has been fighting Islamist militants for decades, and has largely succeeded in containing the threat. However, the emergence of Jund al-Khilafa and other groups aligned with Islamic State has raised concerns that Algeria could become a new battleground in the militants' global campaign. The killing of Gourdel has also highlighted the security challenges facing Westerners in North Africa, where several other hostages have been taken in recent years. In 2011, two French journalists were killed in northern Mali by al-Qaeda-linked militants, and in 2013, a British tourist was kidnapped and held for three months before being released. The kidnappings and killings have led some Western governments to advise their citizens against traveling to certain parts of North Africa.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Wage inequality lowest in Wales, says ONS figures","By Sarah Dickins BBC Wales economics correspondent The highest paid 1% of Welsh workers earn on average £41.20 an hour, seven times the lowest 10% on £5.80. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there has been little change in wage inequality in Wales since 2019, when the gap was slightly narrower. Wales has the lowest wage inequality of the UK nations and regions. But unions say the squeeze on living costs means workers in Wales are still struggling. The ONS figures show that since records began in 1997, there has been a long-term increase in the hourly pay gap between the highest and lowest paid workers in Wales. In 1997, the top 10% of earners were paid 3.8 times more than the lowest 10%. The TUC said the rising cost of food, fuel and energy meant workers were ""in the midst of a cost of living crisis"". Shavanah Taj, the TUC's Wales regional secretary, said: ""This data shows that the gap between the highest and lowest paid workers is growing. ""Workers in Wales, like workers across the UK, are in the midst of a cost of living crisis."" She called on the UK government to take ""urgent action"" to support low-income workers and families. ""That means increasing the minimum wage to at least £10 an hour immediately, boosting Universal Credit and increasing investment in public services,"" she added. The Welsh government said it was ""committed to tackling inequality"" and had taken steps to support low-paid workers. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have introduced the real living wage for all our employees and NHS workers, and invested £36m to establish the Young Person's Guarantee, which will ensure young people in Wales are offered a job, apprenticeship, training opportunity or other support after completing their education or training. ""We are also investing heavily in supporting businesses to grow and innovate, which will help to create more high-quality jobs in Wales.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Birmingham voters reject elected mayor plan,"Birmingham was among 10 English cities voting in mayoral referendums on the same day as the local council elections. In Birmingham 57.8% voted no. Eight other cities voted to adopt the elected mayor model. The referendum was held on 5 May 2023. <br> The proposal to change Birmingham’s system of local government was put forward by Birmingham City Council. It argued that a mayor would be able to provide stronger leadership and would be more accountable to the public than the current committee system. <br> However, the proposal was opposed by a number of groups, including the Birmingham Trades Union Council and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. They argued that an elected mayor would be too powerful and would not be representative of the city as a whole. <br> The turnout for the referendum was 28.9%, which was lower than the turnout for the local council elections. This suggests that many people were not engaged with the issue of whether or not to have an elected mayor. <br> The result of the referendum means that Birmingham will retain its current committee system of local government. This system is based on the principle of collective responsibility, meaning that all decisions are made by the council as a whole. <br> The result of the referendum is a blow to the government’s plans to introduce elected mayors in all of England’s major cities. However, it is not clear whether the government will abandon its plans in light of the Birmingham result. <br> The decision on whether or not to have an elected mayor is a complex one. There are a number of factors to consider, including the size of the city, the level of public engagement, and the nature of the local political landscape. <br> In the case of Birmingham, it is clear that the public was not convinced by the arguments in favor of an elected mayor. It is also worth noting that Birmingham has a long history of strong civic leadership, which may have made the public less likely to support a change to the current system.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid: Highest weekly deaths in Wales since pandemic began,"There were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before. This was nearly 40% of all registered deaths, the highest proportion since the pandemic began. The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also show that the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales since the pandemic began were recorded in the last week of December. Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate of 297 people in the week ending 29 December. This is up from 172 the previous week and is the highest weekly total since the week ending 7 May 2020. The number of Covid-related deaths in Wales has been rising in recent weeks, after a period when they had been relatively low. In the week ending 18 December, there were 15 Covid-related deaths. In the week ending 25 December, there were 29 Covid-related deaths. And in the week ending 1 January, there were 47 Covid-related deaths. The ONS figures show that the number of deaths from all causes in Wales has also been increasing in recent weeks. In the week ending 15 January, there were 1,165 deaths in Wales, up from 1,105 the previous week. This is the highest weekly total since the week ending 23 April 2020. The increase in deaths is likely to be due to a number of factors, including the cold weather, the flu season, and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The Welsh government has said that it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation and is ""taking action to reduce the number of deaths"". The government has urged people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu, and to take other measures to protect themselves, such as wearing masks in crowded places and washing their hands regularly. The government has also said that it is ""working with the NHS to ensure that there is enough capacity to meet the increased demand for healthcare services"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Belarus: Journalists covering protests stripped of accreditation,"Two journalists with the BBC's Russian service are among those affected. In a statement, the BBC said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the move by the Belarusian authorities. ""Journalists must be allowed to do their jobs without fear of reprisals,"" the statement said. ""We stand by our journalists and will continue to report on the situation in Belarus."" The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) said that the move was a ""blatant attack on freedom of the press"" and called on the authorities to reinstate the journalists' accreditation. ""This is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence independent journalists who are reporting on the protests,"" BAJ chairman Andrei Bastunets said. ""We will not be silenced."" The move by the Belarusian authorities comes amid a wider crackdown on dissent in the country. In recent months, hundreds of people have been arrested and detained for taking part in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's rule. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and has been accused of rigging elections and suppressing dissent. The current protests were sparked by the August 9 presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide. However, the opposition and many international observers have said that the election was rigged. The protests have been largely peaceful, but there have been some violent incidents. In August, a protester was killed by a police rubber bullet. The Belarusian authorities have responded to the protests with a heavy-handed crackdown. Police have used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons against protesters. Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained, and some have been tortured. The international community has condemned the crackdown and called for Lukashenko to step down. The European Union has imposed sanctions on Belarus, and the United States has said that it will consider imposing sanctions as well. Despite the crackdown, the protests have continued. Protesters have taken to the streets every day since the election, and they show no signs of giving up.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Over 300 patients refuse ambulance over Covid-19 fears,"Toby Lewis, chief executive of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, said hospitals are now ""much clearer"" about how to manage the infection. ""We've been doing this now for quite some time, we've had this experience over the last couple of months, so I think the trust is now much better placed and better equipped at managing this issue,"" he said. ""So all our hospitals and all of our services have got safe pathways in place for managing patients. We're disinfecting equipment and we're cleaning our facilities regularly, our staff are washing their hands frequently, and we're providing masks and gloves where necessary."" He said the trust is also working with Public Health England to ""ensure that we're following all the guidance and that we're doing everything we can to protect our patients and our staff"". Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust is one of a number of trusts across the UK that have reported a rise in the number of patients refusing to be transported to hospital by ambulance because of fears over Covid-19. A survey by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives found that 306 patients had refused to be taken to hospital by ambulance between 1 March and 10 April. The survey also found that 136 patients had left an ambulance or hospital department before they had been seen by a clinician. The association's chief executive, Martin Flaherty, said the findings were ""concerning"" and that the public should ""not be afraid"" to call for an ambulance if they need one. ""We understand that people may be worried about catching Covid-19, but we want to reassure them that our ambulances are safe,"" he said. ""Our crews are following all the necessary infection control procedures and we are doing everything we can to protect our patients and our staff."" The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has also urged the public not to be afraid to call for an ambulance if they need one.

Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision',"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off due to mistakes in the care of Jack Adcock, six, after a criminal trial. The Court of Appeal heard her removal for a ""one-off mistake"" had caused ""significant distress"" but should not have resulted in her losing her career. The case has highlighted concerns over the GMC's approach to fitness to practise hearings and raised questions over whether doctors are being unfairly punished. Her suspension was met with widespread condemnation from the medical profession, who argued that it was disproportionate to the mistake she had made. They said it would have a chilling effect on other doctors, making them less willing to take risks. The GMC defended its decision, saying that it needed to protect the public and that Dr Bawa-Garba's mistake had fallen ""far below the standards expected of a doctor"". The Court of Appeal agreed that Dr Bawa-Garba's mistake had been serious but said that it did not justify striking her off. The court said that the GMC had failed to take into account her good character and her previously unblemished record. The court also said that the GMC had not given enough weight to the fact that Dr Bawa-Garba had admitted her mistake and had taken steps to improve her practice. The GMC said it would consider the court's judgment carefully and would decide whether to appeal. Dr Bawa-Garba said she was ""relieved and grateful"" at the court's decision. She said she hoped to return to work as a doctor as soon as possible. The case has raised important questions about the GMC's role and the way it regulates doctors. It has also highlighted the need for a more proportionate approach to fitness to practise hearings. The GMC needs to find a way to balance the need to protect the public with the need to ensure that doctors are treated fairly. It must also find a way to restore public confidence in the medical profession.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
EasyJet hopes to reopen 75% of route network by August,"The airline is already starting limited services this month, as it adjusts to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Customers and cabin crew must wear face masks, and no food or drink will be served on board. EasyJet will use the experience gained from these services to gradually bring more aircraft back into operation through summer and during the peak holiday period in August. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said: ""The safety and well-being of our customers and crew remains our highest priority. ""The measures we are implementing will ensure we are operating our flights safely and in line with the highest standards of hygiene, giving our customers the confidence to fly with us."" EasyJet's flights will initially operate from eight UK airports - Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle. The destinations served will include some of Europe's most popular beach and city break destinations, such as Malaga, Palma, Faro, Corfu, Mykonos and Venice. Customers will be able to book flights on the EasyJet website or through the mobile app. The airline has also announced a number of other measures to help customers feel safe when flying, including: Enhanced cleaning and disinfection of aircraft Hand sanitizer will be available throughout the airport and on board aircraft Passengers will be asked to check in online and print their own boarding passes Passengers will be required to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their flight Passengers will be asked to maintain social distancing at all times EasyJet is the latest airline to announce plans to resume flying after the coronavirus lockdown. British Airways has already started to operate a limited number of flights from Heathrow, and plans to resume more services in July. Ryanair has also announced plans to resume flying from July, with a reduced schedule. The aviation industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines around the world grounding their fleets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has estimated that the airline industry will lose $84bn (£67bn) in revenue this year. But there are signs that the industry is starting to recover, as governments around the world begin to ease lockdown restrictions.

Why we need internet jokes and memes more than ever,"By Will ChalkNewsbeat reporter But how closely are the two linked and what does that say about our mindsets, the internet and our society? Yeah. We're tackling some big questions. And, let's be honest, we are still in the early stages of working out its effects on our lives. But I'm interested in the internet from a philosophical point of view. On some level, the internet is a mirror to the human condition. Sure, it can be a tool for good. Sharing information, supporting each other and connecting people from across the globe. But we can't ignore the toxic side of the web. From misinformation to online abuse, the internet has fostered some of the ugliest parts of society. So much of what we are online is performed. We share the good and the funny things, but how much of ourselves are we shielding? I suggest we look to internet jokes and memes for answers. They're a reflection of ourselves, our foibles, our fears and our dreams. They can be stupid, smart, funny, dull, bizarre, satirical, nonsensical, absurd - all of these things and something we cannot yet comprehend or categorise. I mean, that's what memes are for. Take, for example, the ""distracted boyfriend"" meme that became popular in 2017. The picture is of a man walking down the street, looking at another woman. His girlfriend, walking next to him, is looking the other way. The caption reads: ""Me trying to focus on something important while my mind is distracted by something stupid."" This meme is funny because it is relatable. We have all been distracted by something stupid at some point in our lives. It also pokes fun at our own hypocrisy. We all want to be seen as intelligent and attentive, but we can't help but be distracted by the silly things in life. Another example is the ""two buttons"" meme. This meme shows two buttons, one labelled ""good"" and the other labelled ""bad"". The caption reads: ""Which button will you press?"" This meme is funny because it is so simple. It forces us to confront our own moral choices. We all like to think of ourselves as good people, but what would we do if we were faced with a difficult decision? Internet jokes and memes are not just a way to waste time. They are a way for us to express ourselves, to connect with others, and to make sense of the world around us. They are a reflection of our culture and our society. And they are more important than ever in a world that is increasingly complex and confusing. So next time you see an internet joke or meme, don't just scroll past it. Take a moment to think about it. What does it say about you? What does it say about the world? And most importantly, what does it make you laugh at?",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Census 2020: US adds controversial citizenship question,"A dozen US states are suing to block the move, saying it will deter immigrants from participating. Trump administration officials say the data will help the government allocate resources and enforce the Voting Rights Act. The question, which asks respondents if they are US citizens, was last included in the census in 1950. It was removed in subsequent censuses due to concerns that it discouraged participation by immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants. Opponents of the question argue that it will have the same effect today, leading to an undercount of the population, particularly in immigrant communities. They also argue that the question is unnecessary, as the government can obtain citizenship information from other sources, such as the American Community Survey. Supporters of the question argue that it is necessary to ensure an accurate census count. They say that the data will help the government allocate resources to communities with large immigrant populations and enforce the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in voting based on race or national origin. The Trump administration has said that the question is ""essential"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act. However, critics have argued that the administration's real motive is to suppress the vote of immigrants, particularly Latino immigrants, who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. The legal battle over the citizenship question is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. The Court has previously ruled that the government has a legitimate interest in collecting citizenship data, but it has also said that the government cannot use the data to discriminate against immigrants. The outcome of the legal battle will have a significant impact on the 2020 census. If the citizenship question is allowed to remain on the census, it could lead to an undercount of the population, particularly in immigrant communities. This could have a negative impact on the allocation of resources and the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
No cause of death for Eric Garner after New York arrest,"Continuing from the given text, the incident involving Eric Garner has sparked outrage and raised questions about police use of force. Two officers and a police sergeant have been placed on desk duty while they are investigated. Speaking to reporters, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said: ""The video is disturbing and raises serious questions."" He also said it was inappropriate for officers to put their hands around a suspect's neck. The video has been widely shared on social media, and has led to protests in New York City and other cities across the United States. Protesters are demanding justice for Garner and an end to police brutality. Some protesters believe that Garner was killed as a result of excessive force used by the police officers. However, the medical examiner's report has not yet been released, and it is unknown what caused Garner's death. The New York City Police Department has a long history of using excessive force against minority suspects. In 2014, a grand jury declined to indict a police officer who killed an unarmed black man named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. That decision led to widespread protests and unrest across the United States. The Garner case is likely to add to the already strained relationship between the police and minority communities. It is also likely to lead to increased scrutiny of police use of force in the United States. In a statement, Garner's family said: ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our loved one. We believe that the officers who killed Eric should be held accountable for their actions."" The family also called for an independent investigation into Garner's death. The Garner case is a reminder of the ongoing problem of police brutality in the United States. It is a tragedy that has left a family and a community in mourning. It is also a call to action for those who believe that police brutality must end.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Health regulator problems 'persist',"By Nick Triggle Health correspondent, BBC News The Care Quality Commission (CQC) was only created in 2009 but has been under fire virtually ever since. The House of Commons' Health Select Committee said the CQC had ""a history of missed opportunities to improve quality and patient safety"". The committee chair, Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, said the CQC was ""too quick to praise and slow to punish"". ""The CQC must become a more consistent, more effective, more transparent and more independent regulator,"" he said. The committee's report comes after a series of high-profile scandals in the NHS, including the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds of patients died unnecessarily due to poor care. The CQC has been criticized for failing to take tough action against underperforming hospitals and care homes. In its report, the committee said the CQC ""needs to be much clearer about the standards it expects providers to meet, and it needs to be more consistent in its judgments"". The committee also said the CQC ""needs to be more transparent about its inspection process and its decision-making"". The CQC has defended its record, saying it has made significant progress in improving the quality of care in the NHS. However, the committee's report suggests that much more needs to be done. The CQC is responsible for regulating all health and social care services in England. It was created in 2009 to replace the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The CQC's remit includes: Inspecting health and social care services Enforcing standards of care Taking action against providers who fail to meet standards Providing information to the public about the quality of services The CQC has been criticized for a number of reasons, including: Being too lenient on underperforming providers Failing to take tough action against providers who put patients at risk Not being transparent about its inspection process Not being independent enough from the government The CQC has defended its record, saying it has made significant progress in improving the quality of care in the NHS.

Royal Cornwall Hospital 'neglected' woman who died in A&E,"Katy Lowry, 30, who had chromosomal abnormalities and learning difficulties, was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital on 13 December 2016. She had been vomiting every 15 minutes for nearly 24 hours. Despite her condition, Lowry waited for hours in A&E before being seen by a doctor. She was repeatedly sent home and told to come back the following day. On 14 December, Lowry returned to the hospital with her mother. She was seen by a doctor but was again sent home. On 15 December, Lowry was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance after her condition deteriorated. She was admitted to A&E at 8.20pm but died less than two hours later. A post-mortem examination found that Lowry died from a perforated bowel. The coroner ruled that her death was ""wholly avoidable"" and that she had been ""neglected"" by the hospital. The Royal Cornwall Hospital has apologized for the ""failings"" in Lowry's care and has launched an investigation. Lowry's family said they were ""devastated"" by her death and angry that she had been ""failed"" by the hospital. They said: ""Katy was a vulnerable person who needed help. She should have been seen by a doctor and given proper treatment straight away."" The family is now calling for a public inquiry into Lowry's death. The Royal Cornwall Hospital is one of several hospitals in the UK that have been criticized for providing poor care to patients. In 2013, a report by the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital was ""inadequate"" and ""unsafe."" The hospital has since been placed in special measures and is under close scrutiny by the government. The Health Secretary has said that he is ""extremely concerned"" about the care provided at the Royal Cornwall Hospital. He said: ""I have asked the Care Quality Commission to carry out an urgent investigation into the hospital. I want to know what went wrong and why."" The government is also planning to launch a new inquiry into the provision of care in hospitals. The inquiry will be led by Robert Francis QC, who previously led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. The Francis Inquiry found that hundreds of patients died at Mid Staffordshire hospital due to poor care. The inquiry also found that the hospital had a culture of bullying and intimidation that prevented staff from speaking out about concerns. The government hopes that the new inquiry will help to identify the problems in the NHS and ensure that patients are treated with dignity and respect.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The negotiations have been difficult, with both sides accusing the other of being unreasonable. The UK wants a deal that gives it the freedom to set its own laws and trade with other countries. The EU wants a deal that ensures that the UK does not gain an unfair advantage over its members. Le Drian's comments are the latest sign that the negotiations are likely to be tough. He said that the UK and EU were ""miles apart"" on a number of key issues, including fishing rights and state aid. He also said that the UK was ""underestimating"" the challenges it would face in negotiating a trade deal with the EU. He said that the UK would have to accept the EU's rules and regulations if it wanted access to the single market. The UK government has said that it is prepared to leave the EU without a deal if it cannot get a satisfactory agreement. However, this would be a major blow to the UK economy. The EU has said that it is willing to be flexible in the negotiations, but it will not compromise on its core principles. The two sides are due to meet again for negotiations next week. It is hoped that they will be able to make progress, but it is clear that the negotiations will be difficult.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Shakespeare's skull 'probably stolen' from Stratford grave,"The discovery gives credence to a news report in 1879, later dismissed as fiction, that trophy hunters took the skull from his shallow grave in 1794. A team used a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) scan to look through the soil beneath the Holy Trinity Church floorboards, where Shakespeare is buried. The scan revealed anomalies which suggested that the poet's skull may have been removed from his grave. The parish clerk's record of the funeral in April 1616 states that Shakespeare's body was placed in a shallow grave dug seven feet deep. There was no evidence of a coffin. By the 17th Century, it was common practice to reuse graves after 10 years, and Shakespeare's grave was considered fair game. In 1794, the sexton of the church at the time, William Castle, offered visitors to Shakespeare's grave the opportunity to view the skull and other bones for a fee. A young man paid a shilling to view the skull, but when he wanted to sketch it, Castle demanded another five shillings. The youth refused, and a fight ensued. According to the press cutting from The Argos of 7th June 1879: ""The struggle was witnessed by a sexton from an adjoining parish. When questioned about the disturbance, Castle confessed that he had dug up the remains the previous May. ""He said that he sold the skull, which appeared to have been perforated by a pike or other weapon, to a man in a white coat and brown trousers. Castle was drunk at the time and did not know the buyer's name. The skull was then worth £300 but would now be worth many times that amount."" In 1836, a monument was built close to the grave to deter visitors from trying to dig up the remains. The grave itself lies within the sanctuary and is covered by a stone slab. The GPR scan revealed significant voids beneath the floor around the tomb believed to be Shakespeare's. Dr. Kevin Colls, who led the GPR scan team, said: ""We discovered a significant void in the area of the skull and neck, and other voids that appear to be consistent with the removal of long bones. ""I am more convinced on the basis of what we saw on the scan, that the skull is not present in the grave. This is a significant development that supports the theory that Shakespeare's skull was stolen."" The Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, the Rev. Patrick Taylor, said: ""These findings are fascinating and provide fresh evidence to support the theory that Shakespeare's skull was stolen.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Stone Roses film ‘has band’s blessing’,"By Kev Geoghegan Entertainment reporter, BBC News, in Cannes The film is part of a slate of projects announced by BBC Films in Cannes. It tells the story of a gang of young teenagers who grow up listening to the music of The Stone Roses and dream of emulating their heroes on stage. The film has the blessing of the band, and guitarist John Squire is on board as an executive producer. McCluskey, who wrote the film, said he was inspired by his own experiences growing up in Manchester in the 1980s and 1990s. ""I wanted to capture the feeling of that time, when The Stone Roses were the biggest band in the world and they were inspiring a whole generation of young people,"" he said. ""The film is about the power of music and how it can change your life."" The film will be directed by Shane Meadows, who is known for his work on films such as This Is England and Twenty Four Seven. Meadows said he was attracted to the project because of its ""heart and soul"". ""It's a film about friendship, love and music,"" he said. ""It's a film that will resonate with anyone who has ever been a teenager and dreamed of being in a band."" The film is due to start shooting in Manchester in the summer of 2023. BBC Films is a division of the BBC that produces and distributes feature films. It has been responsible for a number of successful films in recent years, including The Favourite, Bohemian Rhapsody and Judy. The Stone Roses are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. They are one of the most successful British bands of all time, with their debut album, The Stone Roses, being hailed as a masterpiece. The band split up in 1996, but they reformed in 2011 and have been touring and recording ever since.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
There's now a word for nails on a blackboard - but it's not in English,"It's a word to describe the feeling we get when we hear the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard, or a knife scraping a plate. The word is ""misophonia"", and it comes from the Greek words ""miso"" (hatred) and ""phone"" (sound). People with misophonia have a strong negative reaction to certain sounds, even everyday ones like chewing, slurping, or breathing. These sounds can trigger feelings of anger, anxiety, or even panic. Misophonia is a relatively new condition, and it's not yet fully understood. However, research suggests that it may be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, brain structure, and life experiences. There is no cure for misophonia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include sound therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and medication. If you think you may have misophonia, it's important to see a doctor to get a diagnosis. There are also a number of support groups available for people with misophonia, which can provide information and support. What causes misophonia? The exact cause of misophonia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including: Genetics: Misophonia may be inherited, as it often runs in families. Brain structure: People with misophonia have been found to have differences in the way their brains process sound. Life experiences: Certain life experiences, such as trauma or abuse, may increase the risk of developing misophonia. What are the symptoms of misophonia? The symptoms of misophonia can vary from person to person, but they typically include: A strong negative reaction to certain sounds Feelings of anger, anxiety, or panic Difficulty concentrating Withdrawal from social situations Irritability Fatigue How is misophonia treated? There is no cure for misophonia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include: Sound therapy: This involves listening to sounds that are designed to reduce the negative reaction to trigger sounds. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): This type of therapy helps people to change the way they think about and react to trigger sounds. Medication: Some medications, such as antidepressants, can help to reduce the symptoms of misophonia.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Blood test 'detects cancer relapse',"Blood test 'detects cancer relapse' By James Gallagher Health editor, BBC News website Scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found traces of breast cancer eight months before doctors would normally have noticed. In the trial, the blood test spotted the secondary tumours in 33 out of 49 patients, or 67%, eight months earlier than scans, on average. And three-quarters of the patients were correctly identified by the test within five months. The findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, could be used to guide doctors in giving follow-up treatment after surgery. 'This is a really important advance,' said Prof Nicholas Turner, who led the study. 'We know that detecting cancer recurrence at the earliest possible stage is critical to successful treatment, but current blood tests are far too insensitive.' The test measures the amount of circulating tumour DNA - ctDNA - in the blood. Every time a cell dies, it releases some of its DNA into the blood. Cancerous cells release more ctDNA than normal cells. So a higher-than-normal level of ctDNA in the bloodstream can indicate that cancer is present. In the trial, the test correctly spotted the tumours in almost all patients - 98% -  once they were larger than 3mm. But between 1 and 3mm, the detection rate was 30%. 'We don't yet have enough information to see if this approach could detect cancers less than 1mm, but we continue to improve our techniques,' said Prof Turner. The team think the test could be used to target follow-up treatments for patients who have had surgery. Doctors would be able to detect whether patients were likely to suffer a relapse at least five months earlier than they can with scans. 'For those patients identified with measurable disease, that means treatment can be started more quickly, so giving them the best chance of cure,' said Prof Turner. The team want to do further studies now to confirm the benefits of the test and to develop it for other cancers. 'This is an important step forward in the blood testing field,' said Dr Lisa Wilde, Cancer Research UK's head of research information. 'It's the first time researchers have seen the potential of detecting cancer recurrence at a time when doctors would not normally notice the tumour through standard imaging tests. 'This research could pave the way for a blood test that could improve the care of patients after surgery.'",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Extra £40m for green spaces in England, Boris Johnson pledges","By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The government says the cash will fund thousands of jobs in conservation. The prime minister also promised new national parks and greater protections for England’s iconic landscapes. Environmentalists welcomed the money, but said it represented only a very small proportion of the investment that was needed to tackle the climate and nature emergencies. The announcement came on the eve of the UN climate summit in Glasgow which the UK is hosting. At the summit, world leaders will discuss ways to cut carbon dioxide emissions and protect and restore nature. Campaigners will be looking to persuade governments to come up with more ambitious targets and the extra funding for green spaces will help the UK's case since it will demonstrate that the government is willing to back up its promises with cash. The government says the project will create or support about 6,000 jobs, 4,000 of which will be in the public sector and the rest in the private sector. The 1,500 miles of new footpaths and cycleways are intended to encourage people to get outdoors for exercise and improve their health and well-being. Other themes include: A National Forest for the north of England. Setting up a new national park in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Extending the existing New Forest National Park in Hampshire. Creating a national park in the Yorkshire Dales. Planting millions more trees as part of the UK's commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Creating a Nature Recovery Network - a network of interconnected land and sea to aid wildlife. The government says the project will create or support about 6,000 jobs, 4,000 of which will be in the public sector and the rest in the private sector. In the run-up to the election last year, Mr Johnson promised to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030, with an interim target of 10% to be achieved by 2023. The government says 11% of land in England is now designated for protection and the new announcement is intended to help hit the target. Conservationists warned, however, that designating land is not enough and the government needs to ensure that the protected areas are managed in a way that benefits nature. The Wildlife Trusts said the extra funding was ""a good start"" but more was needed. ""This funding is welcome at a time when the climate and nature crises are threatening to overwhelm the natural world,"" said the group's chief executive, Craig Bennett. ""But it's just a drop in the ocean compared to the £1bn needed annually to restore and safeguard the UK's natural assets."" The RSPB welcomed the creation of a National Forest for the north of England, saying it was a ""huge opportunity"" to bring back nature and tackle the climate emergency. ""The creation of a National Forest, if done right, has the potential to be both a nature recovery powerhouse and a beacon for the north of England,"" said RSPB director of conservation Mike Clarke.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Anna Sorokin: Fake heiress released from US prison,"Anna Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy socialite named Anna Delvey, was released from prison on Thursday, according to US media reports. She was found guilty in 2019 of theft of services and grand larceny, after convincing banks and hotels that she was an heiress with millions of dollars at her disposal. Now freed, Sorokin faces deportation to Germany, her native country. She has been held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since her release from prison. In a statement, ICE said that Sorokin ""has been ordered removed from the United States and is in the process of being repatriated to Germany."" Sorokin's story captivated the public, and she became known as the ""Soho grifter"" after she lived a lavish lifestyle in New York City, staying in expensive hotels and dining at exclusive restaurants without paying her bills. She funded her lifestyle by writing bad checks, using fake bank statements, and taking out loans in other people's names. Sorokin's trial was a media sensation, and she was portrayed as both a glamorous scammer and a victim of her own ambition. Her lawyer argued that she had intended to pay back the money she owed, but her plans had fallen through. The judge in the case, however, said that Sorokin had ""knowingly and intentionally defrauded numerous financial institutions and individuals."" Sorokin's release from prison has reignited interest in her story. She has been interviewed by numerous media outlets, and there are plans for a television series and a book about her life. It remains to be seen whether Sorokin will be able to rebuild her life after prison, but her story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of living a lie.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Car immobiliser easy to crack, say researchers","Vehicles made by Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and Chrysler have been affected, the researchers from Birmingham, Newcastle and Radboud University in the Netherlands said. The team say car manufacturers must change the encryption method used, as the current system is 'outdated'. The immobiliser, a security device fitted to most modern cars, is designed to prevent a vehicle from being started if the correct key is not used. It works by using a transponder chip in the key to send a unique encrypted code to the car's engine control unit. If the code matches, the engine will start. If it doesn't, the engine will not start. However, the researchers have found that the encryption system used in many car immobilisers can be cracked, potentially letting a thief steal the car. They say that the encryption system used in many car immobilisers is based on a technique called 'rolling code'. Rolling code is a method of encryption where the code changes each time the key is used. This makes it difficult for a thief to copy the code and use it to start the car themselves. However, the researchers have found that the rolling code system used in many car immobilisers is vulnerable to a type of attack called a 'replay attack'. A replay attack is a type of attack where a thief records the encrypted code being sent from the key to the car's engine control unit. The thief can then replay the recorded code to the car's engine control unit, which will then start the car. The researchers say that car manufacturers must change the encryption method used in car immobilisers to prevent replay attacks. They say that a more secure encryption method is available, called 'challenge-response'. Challenge-response is a type of encryption where the car's engine control unit sends a challenge to the key. The key then responds with an encrypted response. If the response is correct, the engine will start. If it is not, the engine will not start. The researchers say that challenge-response is a more secure encryption method than rolling code, and that car manufacturers should adopt it to prevent replay attacks. A spokesperson for Ford said: ""We are aware of the research and are working to address the concerns raised. ""In the meantime, we recommend that our customers use a steering wheel lock or other security device to protect their vehicles."" A spokesperson for Toyota said: ""We are aware of the research and are working to develop a solution.

Cocaine smuggling: The bizarre tactics used to hide drugs,"But sneaking drugs under the noses of authorities can be a risky business, as a Colombian cocaine smuggler discovered this week. Security staff at Madrid airport apprehended him as he stepped off a flight from Bogota, with 5kg of cocaine hidden inside prosthetic buttocks he was wearing under his trousers. While this may seem like an extreme and bizarre method of drug concealment, it's just one example of the many tactics smugglers use to evade detection. In 2018, a Polish man was caught trying to smuggle 110 grams of cocaine by hiding it inside a hollowed-out loaf of bread. Another smuggler attempted to conceal cocaine in the lining of his coffin, apparently hoping that customs officials would be reluctant to open it. Food is a common hiding place for smugglers. One individual was caught trying to smuggle cocaine in frozen fish, while another used hollowed-out pineapples. Drug traffickers have even used the mail system to their advantage, sending packages of cocaine disguised as books, toys, and even clothing. Drugs have also been found concealed in items that are more difficult to search. In one case, smugglers hid cocaine in the plaster cast of a broken leg. In another, they concealed the drugs inside a prosthetic limb. And on one memorable occasion, a group of smugglers attempted to smuggle cocaine into the UK by hiding it inside a shipment of live giant African snails. The methods used to smuggle drugs are constantly evolving, as traffickers become more sophisticated in their attempts to outsmart authorities. But despite their ingenuity, smugglers often face harsh consequences if they are caught. Drug trafficking is a serious crime and can result in lengthy prison sentences. These bizarre tactics serve as a testament to the lengths that drug smugglers will go to in order to evade detection. However, the consequences of getting caught can be severe, and it's important to remember that drug smuggling is a very risky endeavor.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Chinese doctors jailed for illegal organ harvesting,"The group had tricked the families of the deceased into thinking they were making official organ donations. Between 2017 and 2018, the gang harvested organs from 25 bodies, selling them on the black market. According to the court, the organs were sold for up to £70,000 each. The gang was led by a man named Wang Xuejie, who was described as a ""master surgeon"" by police. Wang is said to have recruited other doctors and nurses to help him with the illegal operations. The group would target families who were struggling financially, offering them money in exchange for their consent to donate their loved one's organs. In one case, the gang harvested the organs of a 63-year-old woman who had died in a car accident. The woman's family was told that she had been declared brain dead and that her organs would be donated to save the lives of others. However, the organs were sold on the black market instead. The case has shocked China and raised questions about the country's organ donation system. In China, it is illegal to sell organs, and it is only legal to donate organs to registered recipients. However, there is a shortage of organs in China, and the illegal organ trade is thriving. The case has also highlighted the need for better regulation of the organ donation system in China. The government has said that it will crack down on illegal organ harvesting and that it will work to ensure that all organs are donated ethically. However, experts believe that it will be difficult to stop the illegal organ trade in China. The shortage of organs is driving up prices, and there is a lot of money to be made in the illegal trade. The government has said that it will work to educate the public about the importance of organ donation, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to stop the illegal trade. The case is a reminder of the dark side of the organ donation system in China. It is a system that is plagued by corruption and greed, and it is a system that is putting the lives of innocent people at risk.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Times and Sunday Times readership falls after paywall,"Times Online was registering about 21 million unique users a month to its front page earlier this year but the figure fell to around 12 million in recent weeks. The drop in readership has also been seen in The Sunday Times, with the number of unique users falling from about 14 million a month to just over 10 million. The fall in readership comes after both papers introduced a paywall in March, which requires users to pay a subscription fee to access the majority of their content. The move was met with criticism from some quarters, who argued that it would damage the papers' reach and influence. However, the publishers of The Times and The Sunday Times have defended the decision, arguing that it is necessary to protect the quality of their journalism. They also point out that the number of digital subscribers has increased since the paywall was introduced, suggesting that it is not deterring readers from accessing their content. The introduction of paywalls has become increasingly common in the newspaper industry in recent years, as publishers seek to find new ways to generate revenue in the face of declining print sales. However, the success of paywalls has been mixed, with some papers seeing a significant drop in readership while others have seen little or no impact. The Times and The Sunday Times are two of the most prestigious newspapers in the UK, and their decision to introduce a paywall has been closely watched by the industry. The fall in readership that they have experienced is likely to be a concern for other publishers who are considering introducing paywalls of their own. It is too early to say whether the fall in readership experienced by The Times and The Sunday Times will be permanent. However, it does suggest that publishers need to carefully consider the potential impact of paywalls on their audience before implementing them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Tiananmen crash: China police 'detain suspects',"All three people in the vehicle died at the scene, according to state media, while 40 people were injured, including five in critical condition. The attack happened on Thursday evening in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Officials said the suspects belonged to ""an extremist group"". Tensions have been high in Xinjiang for years, with the Muslim Uighur minority facing severe restrictions. China's state-run news agency Xinhua initially described the incident as a ""major traffic accident"". But on Friday, the agency said police had determined it was a ""violent terror attack"". The change in language suggests the authorities believe the attack was premeditated and politically motivated. The suspects' identities and motives have not been released. But analysts say the attack fits a pattern of violence in Xinjiang that has been blamed on Uighurs seeking independence from China. Xinjiang is home to about 10 million Uighurs, a Muslim minority group who have long complained of discrimination by the Han Chinese majority. In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on Uighurs, who are seen as a potential threat to national security. Authorities have detained thousands of Uighurs in internment camps, where they are subjected to political indoctrination and forced labour. The crackdown has drawn international condemnation, with the United States calling it ""a gross violation of human rights"". But China has defended its policies, saying they are necessary to combat terrorism and extremism. The Tiananmen crash is the latest in a series of attacks in Xinjiang in recent years. In 2014, a group of Uighurs attacked a coal mine, killing 37 people. And in 2015, a suicide bombing at a market in Urumqi, the regional capital, killed at least 39 people. The attacks have raised concerns about the stability of Xinjiang and the potential for further violence. The Chinese government has vowed to crack down on terrorism and extremism, but analysts say the crackdown is unlikely to resolve the underlying tensions in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

MEPs vote for universal charger for smartphones,"The resolution passed with 582 votes in favour to 40 against. MEPs will now urge the European Commission (EC) to adopt a legislative proposal to introduce a universal charger for smartphones, tablets, e-readers, headphones, and other portable devices. The move is aimed at reducing electronic waste and making it easier for consumers to charge their devices. Currently, there are dozens of different chargers on the market, which can be confusing and wasteful. ""This is a major step towards reducing electronic waste and making life easier for consumers,"" said Alex Agius Saliba, the MEP who authored the resolution. ""We have been pushing for this for years, and we are finally seeing results."" The EC has said it is ""open"" to the idea of a universal charger. However, it has not yet committed to introducing legislation. MEPs also called for the EC to: Develop a common standard for wireless charging Encourage the use of recycled materials in chargers Make it easier for consumers to repair or replace their chargers The resolution is not binding on the EC. However, it sends a strong message that the Parliament is serious about reducing electronic waste and making it easier for consumers to charge their devices. If the EC does adopt a legislative proposal, it will need to be approved by the Parliament and the Council of the EU before it can become law. The move towards a universal charger has been welcomed by environmental groups. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) said it was a ""positive step"" that would help to reduce electronic waste. ""We urge the European Commission to take this opportunity to introduce a truly universal charger that will work for all devices,"" said EEB policy officer Diego Zorrilla. Consumer groups have also welcomed the move. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said it would make life easier for consumers and help to reduce electronic waste. ""This is a victory for consumers,"" said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens. ""We have been calling for a universal charger for years, and we are glad to see that MEPs have finally listened to our demands.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Oil prices slump on Saudi comments,"The comments by deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman are seen as a challenge to Iran. It has vowed to increase oil production following the lifting of Western sanctions. In the Bloomberg interview, the prince said Saudi Arabia would not reduce output even if it meant the price fell to $20 a barrel. This represents a significant shift in Saudi policy, which has traditionally acted as the swing producer, adjusting output to ensure a stable price. The Saudi move has been welcomed by some analysts, who argue that it could help to accelerate the rebalancing of the oil market. Global oil demand is expected to rise in the coming years, but it is likely to take some time for new production to come on stream. In the meantime, a lower oil price could encourage consumers to use more energy, which would help to reduce the glut. However, other analysts are more cautious, warning that a prolonged period of low prices could damage the global oil industry. Many oil companies are already struggling to cope with the current downturn, and a further drop in prices could lead to bankruptcies and job losses. The Saudi move is also likely to have a significant impact on the geopolitical landscape. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and its decision to flood the market with crude oil is likely to put pressure on other producers, such as Russia and Iran. It could also lead to a reassessment of the US-Saudi relationship, which has been based on close cooperation on oil policy. The impact of the Saudi move on the global economy is still uncertain. Some analysts believe that it could lead to lower inflation and higher economic growth. However, others warn that it could also lead to financial instability and a global recession. Only time will tell what the full implications of the Saudi move will be. However, it is clear that the decision to flood the market with crude oil is a major gamble that could have far-reaching consequences.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims,"Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims Colonia Dignidad was founded by former Nazi soldier Paul Schäfer in 1961. The commune, which was located 350km (220 miles) south of Santiago, was run as a secretive cult and dozens of children were reportedly abused there. Schäfer fled Chile in 1997 after being accused of child abuse. He died in Argentina in 2010 while serving a 20-year prison sentence for child abuse and other crimes. Following a visit to the site of Colonia Dignidad in 2018, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Germany had a ""moral responsibility"" to help the victims of the commune. He announced that Germany would provide €5m (£4.4m) in compensation to the victims. The German government has been criticized for its slow response to the Colonia Dignidad scandal. The commune was first investigated by German authorities in the 1990s, but it was not until 2018 that the German government agreed to provide compensation to the victims. The victims of Colonia Dignidad have welcomed the German government's decision to provide compensation. They say that the money will help them to rebuild their lives and to move on from the horrors that they experienced at the commune. The Colonia Dignidad scandal is a reminder of the dark history of Chile's dictatorship. The commune was a place where human rights were violated with impunity. The German government's decision to provide compensation to the victims is a welcome step towards acknowledging this dark history and helping the victims to heal. The compensation will be paid to victims who were abused at the commune between 1961 and 2005. The payments will range from €5,000 to €10,000 per victim, depending on the severity of the abuse they suffered. The German government has also said that it will provide €1m to help the victims of Colonia Dignidad to build a memorial at the site of the commune. The memorial will serve as a reminder of the horrors that took place there and will help to ensure that the victims are never forgotten. The Colonia Dignidad scandal is a reminder of the importance of human rights and the need to protect children from abuse.

Hungary government proposes same-sex adoption ban,"The proposed amendment would specify that ""the mother is a woman, the father is a man"" and permit only married couples to adopt children. Same-sex marriage is not recognized in Hungary, and the new provision would effectively bar same-sex couples from adopting children. Critics of the proposal argue that it is discriminatory and violates the rights of LGBTQ+ people. They also point out that there is no evidence that same-sex parents are less capable of raising children than heterosexual parents. Supporters of the amendment argue that it is necessary to protect the traditional family unit and that it is in the best interests of children to be raised by a mother and a father. They also claim that same-sex adoption could lead to confusion about gender roles and sexual orientation. The debate over same-sex adoption has been going on for decades in Hungary. In 2007, the country passed a law that banned same-sex couples from adopting children. However, the law was overturned by the Constitutional Court in 2013. The proposed amendment is expected to be debated in Hungary's Parliament in the coming weeks. It is unclear whether the amendment will pass, but it is likely to face strong opposition from LGBTQ+ rights groups and their allies. The issue of same-sex adoption is a complex one with no easy answers. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide where they stand on this issue. In addition to the legal and moral arguments, there is also a growing body of research that shows that same-sex parents are just as capable of raising children as heterosexual parents. A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that children raised by same-sex parents had similar outcomes to children raised by heterosexual parents in terms of academic achievement, social adjustment, and psychological well-being. Another study, published in the journal Child Development, found that children raised by same-sex parents were more likely to have positive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people and to be supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. These studies provide evidence that same-sex parents are just as capable of raising children as heterosexual parents. They also suggest that children raised by same-sex parents may have some advantages over children raised by heterosexual parents, such as being more tolerant and accepting of diversity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
A83 Rest and Be Thankful reopens after landslip,"Workers have been clearing 1,000 tonnes of debris from the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83 after a series of landslips. Meanwhile, the Scottish government is to host a summit for key stakeholders next week to discuss a permanent solution to the ""long-standing instability"" affecting the route. The A83 has been closed since 2 August, when heavy rain led to the collapse of part of the hillside above the road. After initially being expected to reopen within three weeks, ongoing landslips have meant it has remained closed while contractors have worked to make the area safe and remove the debris. In total, seven landslips have happened at the Rest and Be Thankful over the past fortnight. The last occurred on 8 August, affecting 150m of the hillside and blocking the road with 60,000 tonnes of debris. A team of 100 workers have been involved in the clear-up operation, which has involved using helicopter sling operations to remove larger boulders from the affected area. The full reopening of the road is expected to be delayed until next week, with works ongoing to remove all remaining debris and vegetation, as well as to check for any outstanding subsidence. Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland's north west representative, said: ""I want to thank the communities impacted by the ongoing situation for their continued patience and understanding as our team safely removes remaining debris. ""The landslips at the Rest have been challenging but the focus now is on getting the road fully reopened as quickly as possible and safely."" While the A83 has been closed, a contraflow system has been in operation on the A82 between Tarbet and Inverarnan. Drivers have also been able to use the Old Military Road as a diversion, although this has been closed on occasion due to its own landslip issues. The Scottish government will host a summit next week to discuss long-term solutions for the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been subject to numerous landslips over the years. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said: ""The Scottish government is committed to implementing a permanent engineering solution that will mitigate the risks of landslips at the Rest and Be Thankful. ""I have instructed officials to progress design work for a solution that will reduce the frequency and impact of landslips and improve resilience. ""Next week, we will bring together key stakeholders at a summit to discuss the geotechnical survey results and outline our plans to deliver a lasting solution.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Flooding and storm warnings across England,"The Environment Agency has issued flood alerts in 50 areas - 42 of which are in south-east England. Six flood warnings are in place; five for the South East, including parts of Kent, East Sussex, and Hampshire, and one in Dorset. The agency has warned that river levels are rising and could cause flooding, with heavy rain expected to continue throughout the day. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain across the south-east of England, with up to 100mm of rain expected in some areas. The warning is in place until 6pm on Tuesday. The Environment Agency is urging people to be aware of the flood risk and to take steps to protect themselves and their property. This includes checking flood warnings and taking action if necessary, such as moving belongings to higher ground or putting up flood barriers. The agency is also working with local authorities to prepare for flooding and to help communities respond. This includes deploying flood defense equipment, such as pumps and barriers, and providing information and support to residents. People who are concerned about flooding should check the Environment Agency's website for the latest flood warnings and advice. They can also call the Floodline on 0345 988 1188. The Environment Agency is also reminding people to be aware of the dangers of flooding and to never enter floodwater.

New e-petitions website opens,"The petition.parliament.uk site is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a ""new dialogue"" with MPs and ministers. In the past, paper petitions had to be submitted to Parliament by MPs or peers, which meant that only a small number of petitions could be considered each year. The new website will allow anyone to start a petition on any issue, and if it gathers 10,000 signatures, it will be considered for debate in Parliament. The website has been launched with a number of high-profile petitions, including a call for the government to introduce a ""living wage"" and a petition to ban the sale of ivory. The government has welcomed the launch of the website, saying that it will ""give people a stronger voice in our democracy."" However, some critics have argued that the website could be used to promote frivolous or even dangerous petitions. Others have expressed concerns that the website could be used by special interest groups to lobby the government. Despite these concerns, the website is likely to be popular with the public. A recent poll found that 70% of people support the idea of an e-petitions website. The website is part of a wider government initiative to make Parliament more open and accessible. In recent years, the government has also launched a new website for submitting questions to MPs and ministers, and it has opened up the House of Commons to the public for tours and events. The launch of the e-petitions website is a significant step forward for British democracy. It will give people a new and more direct way to have their voices heard in Parliament. Here are some of the benefits of the new e-petitions website: It will make it easier for people to start and sign petitions on issues that they care about.

Jermaine Jackson: 'No truth' to allegations in Michael documentary,"In Leaving Neverland, James Safechuck and Wade Robson claim they were abused by the singer as children. Mr Robson acted as a main witness for Michael Jackson at his 2005 trial, but later filed a lawsuit against the late star after claiming the testimony was given under duress from the singer. The Jackson family and the singer's estate have strongly denied the claims made in the documentary, while several of Michael Jackson's former employees have also spoken out in his defence. A statement from the estate, released after part one of the documentary aired, said: ""This so-called 'documentary' is just another rehash of stale and debunked allegations. It's pathetically one-sided and, in addition, crafted as a commercial product to be exploited for monetary gain."" The statement accused Leaving Neverland's director, Dan Reed, of pursuing ""a sensationalist and biased attack"" on Michael Jackson, ""using unvetted sources to create a salacious story."" Jermaine Jackson, Michael's older brother, has been one of the most vocal members of the family in defending his late brother. In an interview with BBC News, he said: ""To think that my brother would be accused of this is beyond comprehension. It's not true. We grew up together. I know my brother. He would never do something like that."" Jermaine Jackson also said he had spoken to Wade Robson after the 2005 trial and that Robson had told him he was not abused by Michael Jackson. ""He swore on the Bible,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""He was very adamant that he was not abused."" Since the documentary aired, Robson has given several interviews in which he has defended his decision to come forward now. He told CBS News: ""I was groomed from the age of seven. I spent every day with him at Neverland, alone with him in his bedroom, sleeping in his bed. There was no one there to protect me from him. ""I don't want any other child to go through what I went through. That's why I'm sharing my story.""

Robot used to guide surgeons through knee operations,"By Eleanor Bradford BBC Scotland Health Correspondent The technique is being tested at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where 150 patients are involved in trials. It is part of a collaboration between surgeons, bio-engineers and a US health care company and has the potential to make surgery more accurate, less invasive and quicker. The robot is called Rosa and it was originally designed to help remove brain tumours but can also be used to help carry out knee surgery. It works by using a CT scan to create an individual 3D model of a patient's knee, which the surgeon uses to plan the operation. During surgery, the robot then guides the surgeon's movements, making sure they are as precise as possible. This can reduce the risk of complications and speed up the recovery time for patients. Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Mufaddal Meghji said: ""With the current techniques that we use at the moment, we still have to do an additional small incision in the knee to put a camera inside the knee to look around and check our accuracy. ""With the robot, because of the 3D planning that we've done we don't have to do that - we can just go straight in and we're much more likely to be very accurate indeed."" The robot is also being tested in a number of other hospitals around the world and the results so far have been very promising. In one study, patients who had knee surgery using the robot had a 50% reduced risk of complications and were able to recover more quickly than those who had surgery using traditional techniques. The robot is not yet widely available but it is hoped that it will become more common in the future. If it does, it could have a major impact on the way that knee surgery is performed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Parking fine appeal success varies between council areas,"Some English councils approve only one in 10 appeals against on-street fines, while others accept nearly every one. Runnymede Council in Surrey accepted just 9% of appeals while Basildon Council in Essex approved 93%. The figures, from the RAC Foundation, show a wide variation in success rates across 159 councils surveyed. The RAC Foundation's Steve Gooding said: ""The gulf in the success rates between those councils at the top and the bottom of the table is extraordinarily wide."" He said this suggested that some councils were ""too ready to reject appeals"" and called for greater consistency. The data shows that in some areas, drivers are more likely to have their appeals rejected than others. For example, in London, only 18% of appeals were successful, compared to 49% in the West Midlands. The RAC Foundation said this could be due to a number of factors, including the way that councils interpret the rules and the amount of evidence that drivers provide in their appeals. The group is calling for councils to be more transparent about their appeals process and to provide drivers with clear guidance on how to appeal a fine. The Department for Transport said it was ""concerned"" about the variation in success rates and was working with councils to improve the appeals process. A spokesperson said: ""We have introduced a new statutory code of practice for councils to follow when handling parking appeals and will work with councils to ensure they comply with it."" The RAC Foundation's research is based on data from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, which is responsible for adjudicating parking appeals. The tribunal's data shows that the number of appeals has increased in recent years. In 2017, there were 415,000 appeals, compared to 360,000 in 2016. The RAC Foundation said this increase could be due to a number of factors, including the growing number of parking fines being issued and the increasing complexity of the appeals process. The group is calling for the government to simplify the appeals process and to make it easier for drivers to challenge unfair fines.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death,"Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death Megan Lee, 15, suffered irreversible brain damage after having an allergic reaction to food from Royal Spice in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, in 2016. She died two years later. The takeaway's owners, Mohammed Abdul Kuddus, 40, and Harun Rashid, 38, were found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence at Manchester Crown Court on Monday. The court heard that Megan had ordered a chicken tikka masala from the takeaway, which contained peanuts. She was allergic to peanuts and had made it clear to the restaurant staff when she placed her order. However, the food she received contained traces of peanuts, which triggered a severe allergic reaction. Megan's parents, Martin and Gemma, said they were ""relieved"" that the takeaway owners had been found guilty. They said: ""We can now start to try to move on with our lives, knowing that justice has been done."" The court heard that the takeaway had a history of food safety violations. In 2015, it was given a zero rating by the Food Standards Agency after inspectors found mouse droppings in the kitchen. The takeaway was also fined £5,000 for failing to properly label allergens on its menu. In a statement, the Food Standards Agency said: ""This case is a tragic reminder of the importance of food businesses taking their responsibilities seriously. Food businesses must ensure that the food they serve is safe and that they have robust systems in place to manage allergens."" The takeaway's owners have been sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. They have also been banned from working in the food industry for life. Megan's death has led to calls for tougher laws on food safety. Her parents have launched a campaign called ""Megan's Law"", which calls for mandatory prison sentences for food businesses that cause death or serious injury through negligence.

EasyJet half-year loss widens on weaker pound,"The airline recorded a loss of £212m in the six months to March. That compares with a loss of £21m for the same period last year. EasyJet said the weaker pound had ""a significant impact"" on its results, as it increased the cost of buying fuel and other expenses. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: ""The first half of the year has been challenging, with the weaker pound having a significant impact on our results. We have taken action to mitigate these headwinds, including hedging our fuel costs and increasing our focus on cost control. ""We remain confident in our long-term strategy and believe that we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future."" Despite the loss, EasyJet's revenue rose by 5.6% to £2.5bn. The airline said this was driven by a 4.1% increase in passenger numbers. EasyJet also announced that it is to increase its capacity by 8% this summer. The airline said this will ""help to meet the growing demand for air travel in Europe"". The news of EasyJet's loss comes as the airline industry faces a number of challenges, including rising fuel costs, increased competition and the impact of Brexit. Earlier this month, British Airways owner IAG reported a loss of £1.4bn for the first half of the year. The airline said the weaker pound and rising fuel costs had ""a significant impact"" on its results. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry is facing a ""difficult year"" in 2019.

Everest: Top Sherpas slam Nepal's plan to clean rubbish from mountain,"By Surendra Phuyal BBC Nepali The government says the army will be used for the task, which will cost 860 million Nepali rupees ($7.5m; £5.7m). Last year, they managed to clear about 10,000kg of waste from the region. But Kami Rita, who holds the record for the most successful Everest summits, said the plan was yet another ""publicity stunt"". ""There is no guarantee that rubbish thrown in the icefall area will not slide down again,"" he said. ""The only sustainable solution is a ban on trekkers taking oxygen cylinders above base camp."" Most climbers use bottled oxygen to help them breathe at high altitudes, and many discard their empty cylinders on the mountainside. Another veteran Sherpa guide, Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, agreed. ""This plan is impractical and a waste of taxpayers' money,"" he said. ""The army should be used for more important tasks."" The Sherpas have a long history of helping climbers on Everest, and their expertise is essential for the success of expeditions. They have been critical of the government's handling of the mountain in the past, accusing it of putting profit before safety. In 2019, they called for a limit on the number of climbers on Everest after 11 people died in a single week. The government has defended its plan, saying it is committed to cleaning up the mountain. ""We are determined to make Everest clean and safe for climbers,"" said Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai. ""We believe this plan is the best way to achieve that."" The clean-up operation is due to start in April, and it is expected to take several weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Concern raised over changes to probation service,"Concern raised over changes to probation service By the beginning of next year, 70% of its work in England and Wales will be run by private companies. The government says the move will improve efficiency and reduce reoffending, but critics say it will lead to job losses and a drop in standards. The National Probation Service (NPS) is responsible for supervising offenders who have been released from prison or given community sentences. The government has announced plans to split the NPS into two parts. One part will be responsible for high-risk offenders, and the other will supervise low-risk offenders. The high-risk part will remain in the public sector, but the low-risk part will be outsourced to private companies. The government says the move will save money and improve efficiency. It also says that private companies will be able to offer more innovative and effective ways of supervising offenders. However, critics of the plans say they will lead to job losses and a drop in standards. They also say that private companies will be more interested in making a profit than in rehabilitating offenders. Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""This is a disaster for probation and for public safety. ""Private companies have no experience of running probation services and they will be more interested in making a profit than in rehabilitating offenders. ""This will lead to a drop in standards and an increase in reoffending."" The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents probation officers, has also criticized the plans. Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said: ""These plans are a disgrace. ""They will lead to job losses, a drop in standards and an increase in reoffending. ""The government should be investing in the probation service, not dismantling it."" The government has said that it will protect jobs and standards in the probation service. It has also said that it will monitor the performance of private companies closely. However, critics of the plans remain unconvinced.

Coronavirus: Survey suggests business confidence at record low,"The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) survey suggests retail and construction have been among the worst hit sectors during the Covid-19 crisis. But 95% of tourism firms also reported falling confidence as the pandemic took hold. The report found that confidence levels in Scotland's business community fell to a record low during the first quarter of 2021. The SCC's Quarterly Economic Indicator (QEI) survey, which measures business confidence, fell to -42.5%, down from -19.1% in the previous quarter. This is the lowest level of confidence recorded since the survey began in 1994. The survey found that pessimism was widespread across all sectors, with particularly sharp declines in the retail, hospitality, and construction sectors. Retail confidence fell to -65.8%, down from -45.7% in the previous quarter. Hospitality confidence fell to -64.2%, down from -44.2% in the previous quarter. And construction confidence fell to -56.3%, down from -35.9% in the previous quarter. The survey also found that businesses are facing a number of challenges, including a lack of demand, rising costs, and supply chain disruptions. A net balance of -62.3% of businesses reported a decrease in demand during the first quarter of 2021, up from -45.7% in the previous quarter. A net balance of -45.7% of businesses reported an increase in costs during the first quarter of 2021, up from -35.9% in the previous quarter. And a net balance of -35.9% of businesses reported supply chain disruptions during the first quarter of 2021, up from -26.6% in the previous quarter. The SCC report concludes that the Scottish economy is facing a ""significant challenge"" as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report calls on the Scottish Government to provide further support to businesses during this difficult time. In response to the survey findings, the Scottish Government said that it was ""doing everything we can to support businesses during this challenging time."" The government pointed to a number of measures it has introduced to help businesses, including the £2 billion Scottish Business Loan Fund and the £2.2 billion Strategic Framework Business Fund.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty,"David Martin, the MEP responsible for its report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (Acta), said the treaty threatened civil liberties. His comments came less than three months after the previous rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned from the European Parliament due to concerns about the agreement. Martin's report is critical of Acta, saying that it would create a ""new era of Internet surveillance"" and could lead to ""unjustified and disproportionate"" restrictions on online activity. He also said that the treaty would be ineffective in combating counterfeiting, and could actually make the problem worse. The European Parliament is set to vote on Acta in July, and Martin's report is likely to be a key factor in the outcome. If the Parliament votes against the treaty, it will be referred back to the European Commission for further negotiations. The European Commission has defended Acta, saying that it is necessary to protect intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting. However, critics say that the treaty goes too far, and could have a negative impact on fundamental freedoms. The debate over Acta has been highly divisive, with strong arguments on both sides. It remains to be seen whether the European Parliament will approve the treaty, or whether it will be sent back to the Commission for further negotiations. In the meantime, the controversy over Acta is likely to continue. Critics of the treaty have vowed to fight against it, and there is a growing movement of support for their cause. It is possible that the debate over Acta could even lead to a wider discussion about the future of intellectual property rights in the digital age.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Nuisance calls out of control, says taskforce","It also wants company directors to be held responsible for unwanted phone calls from their businesses. The taskforce has recommended that the threshold at which regulators are able to take action against nuisance calls should be lowered, and that the maximum fine for making such calls should be increased to £500,000. The government has welcomed the taskforce's recommendations, and has said that it will consider them carefully. The taskforce was set up in 2021 to tackle the issue of nuisance calls, which have become a major problem in the UK. In 2020, there were an estimated 4.5 billion nuisance calls made in the UK, with each person receiving an average of 10 calls per month. Nuisance calls can have a significant impact on people's lives. They can be disruptive, annoying, and even distressing. In some cases, they can also lead to financial loss. The taskforce's recommendations are aimed at tackling the problem of nuisance calls in a number of ways. First, the taskforce recommends that the threshold at which regulators are able to take action against nuisance calls should be lowered. This would mean that regulators would be able to take action against companies that make even a small number of nuisance calls. Second, the taskforce recommends that the maximum fine for making nuisance calls should be increased to £500,000. This would send a strong message to companies that making nuisance calls is not acceptable. Third, the taskforce recommends that company directors should be held responsible for nuisance calls made by their businesses. This would mean that directors could be held personally liable for the fines imposed on their companies. The government has welcomed the taskforce's recommendations, and has said that it will consider them carefully. The government has also said that it is committed to tackling the problem of nuisance calls. If the government implements the taskforce's recommendations, it could have a significant impact on the problem of nuisance calls in the UK. The recommendations would make it easier for regulators to take action against companies that make nuisance calls, and would also send a strong message that such calls are not acceptable.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Intensive care demand surged at peak of crisis,"An official report on Covid cases requiring intensive care shows demand peaked on 29 March, with 29 patients admitted in a single day. Admissions remained close to the this level for the next four days, before falling away steadily to reach a low of four patients on 10 May. The 11-page report, published by Public Health Scotland, found the median age for admissions for Covid-related critical care was 67, and around two thirds of patients were male. In total, 1,002 Covid cases were admitted to intensive care in Scotland between 23 February and 15 June. Of those, 63% were discharged from hospital, and 37% died. The report's authors conclude: ""Critical care admissions peaked on 29th March following which there was a slow but sustained decline in the number of admissions throughout April and May. ""From 1st June, the number has remained low, with only one patient admitted to a critical care bed in the last three weeks. ""These data show that the critical care surge capacity created was not required in Scotland."" However, Prof. Andrew Elder, vice-president of the Scottish Intensive Care Society, warned: ""The report is in effect a post mortem on the first critical phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and shows that the dreadful predictions made by some who even suggested using the car park at Hampden Stadium as an ICU did not come about. ""NHS staff across Scotland should take heart from this, and from the fact that those who do become critically unwell have an extremely good chance of recovering."" The report's findings come a month after the mortality data from the first wave of the pandemic in June were published, which revealed 85% of Covid-19 deaths had occurred in care homes. A separate report by the National Records of Scotland last month showed that at the peak of the crisis in mid-April, 80.5% of all deaths in Scotland were caused by Covid-19. On Wednesday, the Scottish government's daily update showed there had been 147 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the previous 24 hours - the highest UK total since 30 May.

Oxford top of global university rankings,"Oxford top of global university rankings By Sean Coughlan BBC News family and education correspondent The annual Times Higher Education world rankings put Cambridge in third place and Imperial College London in tenth. But there is a warning from the compilers of the rankings that other UK universities may struggle to keep up with their international rivals as government spending cuts begin to bite. Oxford's top position is a return to its pre-pandemic ranking, after falling to second place last year. The rankings are based on a range of factors, including teaching quality, research output, industry links and international outlook. Oxford was praised for its strong record in research, with 98% of its research being judged to be ""world-leading"" or ""internationally excellent"". The university also has a high proportion of international staff and students, which helped to boost its score for ""international outlook"". Cambridge remains in the top three, with its strong performance in teaching quality, research and industry links. Imperial College London moves up one place to tenth, with its strengths in engineering and technology. However, there are concerns that other UK universities may struggle to keep up with their international rivals in the future. The government has cut funding for higher education in recent years, and universities are facing increasing competition from international institutions. The Times Higher Education rankings editor, Phil Baty, said that UK universities need to ""adapt and innovate"" to remain competitive. ""UK universities have been hit hard by the pandemic and government spending cuts,"" he said. ""They need to find ways to become more efficient and to generate more income from other sources."" Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said that the rankings are a ""testament to the continued strength of the UK higher education sector"". However, it warned that the government's funding cuts are ""putting our global competitiveness at risk"".

Israeli 'Freedom is basic' niqab advert criticised,"By George Pierpoint, BBC Newsand Osob Elmi, BBC News The ad, for clothing brand Hoodies, opens with a caption reading ""Is Iran here?"" and depicts a young woman wearing a black niqab looking over her shoulder with the eyes cut out. It continues with a series of images of women with varying skin colours and body shapes wearing the same garment. Chief executive of the Muslim Council of Britain Zara Mohammed said the advert was ""deeply offensive"" and ""plays on the worst stereotypes of Muslim women"". ""Ultimately, determining what women can and cannot wear is dangerous territory because it can quickly lead to restricting women's choices and autonomy,"" she added. ""This is about so much more than a garment of clothing; it's about respecting women's choices and upholding their rights to live free from discrimination and prejudice."" The company behind the advert, Hoodies, is owned by Israeli street artists known as Broken Fingaz Crew. In a statement, the artists said that they created the advert to ""provoke thought"" about the issue of freedom of expression. ""Hoodies is not about fashion,"" they said. ""It's about freedom of expression. We believe that everyone has the right to wear what they want, regardless of their religion or cultural background."" The advert has been met with mixed reactions online. Some have praised the artists for their creativity and for highlighting the issue of freedom of expression. Others have condemned the advert as offensive and islamophobic. The debate over the niqab is a complex one. In some countries, such as France and Belgium, it is banned in public places. In other countries, such as the UK and the US, it is legal to wear the niqab, but it is often met with public hostility. The niqab is a garment that covers the face and body, leaving only the eyes exposed. It is worn by some Muslim women as a symbol of modesty and religious devotion. However, it has also been associated with extremism and oppression. The issue of whether or not to ban the niqab in public places is a contentious one. There are strong arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to ban the niqab is a political one.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
SNP conference: Sturgeon pledges childcare 'revolution',"The new SNP leader unveiled the ambitious plans at the party's conference in Perth. It would see the number of free hours increase from 16 to 30 every week. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to give every child in Scotland ""the best possible start in life"" and said that the policy would help to close the poverty-related attainment gap. The policy is expected to cost £1.4 billion a year and would be funded by increasing taxes on high earners. It is a key part of the SNP's manifesto for the upcoming Scottish Parliament election in May 2021. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Childcare is a vital part of our economy and our society. It allows parents to work and contribute to the economy, and it gives children the best possible start in life. ""But for too many families, childcare is simply too expensive. That's why I'm announcing today that the SNP will introduce a childcare revolution in Scotland. ""We will increase the number of free childcare hours from 16 to 30 every week. This will make a real difference to families across the country. It will help parents to get back to work, and it will give children the best possible start in life."" The policy has been welcomed by childcare providers and parents alike. The Scottish Childminding Association said that it would be a ""game-changer"" for families. One parent, Sarah Smith, said: ""This is fantastic news. It will make a huge difference to our family. I'm a single parent and I work full-time. I've been struggling to pay for childcare, and I've had to reduce my hours at work. ""This policy will give me the flexibility to work full-time and still be able to afford to look after my child. It's a huge relief."" The policy is expected to be a key battleground in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.

At what age do you feel you have reached adulthood?,"Nationwide's study of 2,000 over-18s found more than one in 10 did not think of themselves as fully fledged grown-ups until they reached the age of 27. This suggests that the traditional view of adulthood being reached at 18 is outdated, and that people are taking longer to feel like they have fully matured. There are a number of factors that may have contributed to this change. One is the increasing complexity of modern life. Young people today face a more challenging job market, higher levels of debt, and a more complex social landscape than their parents did. This can make it difficult for them to feel like they have their lives together, even if they have reached the age of 18. Another factor is the rise of social media. Social media can create a sense of comparison and competition, which can make young people feel like they are not measuring up. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and inadequacy, which can make it difficult to feel like an adult. Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of when adulthood is reached. Some people may feel like adults at 18, while others may not feel like they have fully matured until they are in their 30s or even 40s. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide when they feel like they have reached adulthood. However, the Nationwide study suggests that the traditional view of adulthood being reached at 18 is outdated. Young people today are taking longer to feel like they have fully matured, and this is likely due to a number of factors, including the increasing complexity of modern life and the rise of social media. It is important to remember that there is no right or wrong answer to the question of when adulthood is reached. Everyone develops at their own pace, and there is no need to compare yourself to others. If you are not feeling like an adult yet, don't worry. You will get there eventually.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

It said that Mr Hill had flown the aircraft below the minimum safe height at the time of the crash. A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) report into the accident found that Mr Hill had flown the aircraft ""below the published minimum safe altitude during the manoeuvre, contrary to the display authorisation issued by Southport Airshow"". The report also found that Mr Hill had not been properly briefed on the risks of flying the aircraft below the minimum safe height. The CAA said that Mr Hill had ""failed to maintain a safe height above the ground"" and that this was ""a contributory factor to the accident"". The report also found that the air traffic control (ATC) service provided by Southport Airshow was ""inadequate"" and that the ATC staff had not been properly trained. The CAA said that the ATC staff had ""failed to provide the pilot with adequate information and guidance about the minimum safe height"" and that this was ""a contributory factor to the accident"". The CAA has made a number of recommendations to Southport Airshow and the ATC service provider in order to prevent a similar accident from happening again. These recommendations include: Revising the display authorisation to ensure that it clearly states the minimum safe height for the display Providing the pilot with a more detailed briefing on the risks of flying the aircraft below the minimum safe height Improving the training of the ATC staff Providing the ATC staff with better information about the minimum safe height Southport Airshow said that it had accepted the CAA's recommendations and that it would be implementing them.

Italy's Giuseppe Conte tells populist leaders: 'Stop fighting or I'll quit',"Mr Conte said the parties must ""honour the government's obligations"" or he would ""simply end my mandate"". The fractious year-old coalition of the League, the far-right party of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, and the populist Five Star Movement, headed by former Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, has been on the verge of collapse for weeks. On Tuesday, Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, repeated his call for fresh elections, saying the coalition was ""finished... beyond repair"". His comments came after the League failed in an attempt to pass a motion of no confidence in Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli from the Five Star Movement. Di Maio has accused Salvini of seeking to ""destroy"" the government and has said that Five Star will not be ""blackmailed"". He has also said that the government should be allowed to continue until its term expires in 2023. The coalition has been riven by disagreements over a range of issues, including immigration, the economy and Europe. Salvini has been a vocal critic of the EU and wants to renegotiate Italy's membership. Five Star, on the other hand, has a more pro-European stance. The crisis in the coalition has raised concerns about Italy's political stability and the future of its membership of the eurozone. The country is already struggling with a high level of public debt and a weak economy. If the coalition collapses, it could lead to fresh elections and a period of political instability. This could damage Italy's economy and its relationship with the EU. Conte has said that he is ""determined"" to keep the government together, but it is unclear whether he will be able to do so.

Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales,"Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales By Matt Lloyd BBC Wales More than 50% of snake, newt and toad species are under threat globally, conservationists have said. In Wales, common lizards are the only reptiles that are not considered a priority for conservation action. But adders, slow-worms, and grass snakes are all ""of conservation concern"", while the natterjack toad has undergone severe population decline. Efforts are underway to help these species. The Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales is appealing for volunteers to help survey reptiles and amphibians. The survey is part of a larger project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, which aims to create a network of homes for wildlife across south and west Wales. The trust's conservation officer, Katie-jo Luxton, said: ""Reptiles and amphibians are an important part of our ecosystem. ""For example, adders help to control rodent populations, while grass snakes eat small mammals and birds. ""They are also a food source for other animals, such as foxes and buzzards."" The trust's survey will help to identify where reptiles and amphibians are found, and to assess the threats they face. This information will then be used to develop conservation plans to help these species. Ms Luxton said: ""We need volunteers to help us with this survey. It's a great opportunity to learn more about these fascinating creatures and to help us to protect them."" Volunteers will be trained to identify reptiles and amphibians, and to record their sightings. They will also be asked to collect data on the habitat where they see these animals. The survey will run from April to September. Anyone who is interested in volunteering can contact the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales. In addition to the survey, the trust is also working to create new homes for reptiles and amphibians. This includes creating ponds for toads and newts, and creating log piles and stone walls for snakes and lizards. Ms Luxton said: ""We hope that by creating new homes for these animals, we can help to increase their populations and to ensure their long-term survival.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Honour of Kings: China's most vilified online game,"By Timothy McDonald Business Reporter, BBC News Access to Honour of Kings is now restricted to one hour a day for children aged under 12 and two hours for children between 12 and 18. The limits were announced by Tencent, the Chinese gaming giant behind the title, in response to growing concerns about gaming addiction among young people. Honour of Kings is one of the most popular mobile games in the world, with over 100 million daily active users. However, it has also been the subject of much controversy, with critics arguing that it is addictive and harmful to children. Tencent has defended the game, saying that it has taken steps to address the issue of addiction. In addition to the new time limits, the company has also introduced a number of other measures, such as limiting the amount of money that children can spend on in-game purchases. However, some experts believe that the new measures do not go far enough. They argue that the time limits are too lenient and that the game should be banned for children altogether. The debate over Honour of Kings is part of a wider discussion about the impact of gaming on children. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the amount of time that children spend playing video games, and the potential effects of this on their physical and mental health. Some studies have suggested that excessive gaming can lead to a number of problems, including addiction, obesity, and sleep deprivation. However, other studies have found that gaming can also have positive benefits, such as improving cognitive skills and social development. The debate over the impact of gaming on children is likely to continue for some time. In the meantime, parents should be aware of the potential risks and benefits of gaming, and should set limits on their children's gaming time. Tencent's new time limits on Honour of Kings are a step in the right direction, but they do not go far enough. The company should consider banning the game for children altogether, or at least reducing the time limits further.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Cambridge homeless man Raymond Boyle's killer, 18, jailed","Jack Robinson stamped on 53-year-old Raymond Boyle's head and back, in Jesus Green last June. He dragged him unconscious to the River Cam, where his body was found the following day. On Friday, Robinson, 18, was convicted of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years. The court was told that Boyle, who was originally from County Down, had been sleeping rough in Cambridge for a number of months at the time of his death. Witnesses described how Robinson had been drinking all day and was ""in a rage"" before launching his brutal attack on Boyle, who was unarmed and had done nothing to provoke him. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Boyle's sister said: ""My brother was a gentleman. He always had time for others and never had a bad word to say about anyone. He did not deserve what happened to him."" Detective Inspector Emma Whitting, who led the investigation, said: ""This was a senseless and brutal act of violence that has robbed a family of a loved one. Our thoughts are with Raymond's family and friends at this difficult time."" Robinson had denied murder, claiming that he had acted in self-defense. However, the jury rejected his account and convicted him by a majority of 11 to one. In sentencing Robinson, Judge David Farrell said: ""This was a sustained and violent attack on a defenseless man who was sleeping on the streets. You have shown no remorse for your actions and I am satisfied that you are a dangerous offender."" Robinson's conviction is a reminder of the dangers faced by homeless people in the UK. According to the charity Crisis, there are over 4,000 people sleeping rough on the streets of England on any given night. Many of these people are vulnerable to violence and abuse.

MP Yeo cleared by standards watchdog,"The Tory MP was secretly filmed by Sunday Times investigators posing as representatives of a fictional energy company seeking to hire his services. The paper said he had suggested charging up to £7,000 for a day's work, and had offered to use his parliamentary status to ""bang the drum"" for the company. In a statement, Mr Yeo said he had ""fully co-operated"" with the investigation and had ""nothing to hide"". He said he was ""completely confident"" that he had not broken any rules. The Standards Commissioner is an independent watchdog that investigates allegations of breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. It can recommend sanctions, including suspension from Parliament. In its report, the Commissioner said that there was ""no evidence"" that Mr Yeo had breached the MPs' code of conduct. It said that he had not used his parliamentary status to lobby for the company, and that he had not charged for any work that he had not carried out. The Commissioner did, however, find that Mr Yeo had ""failed to declare"" his meeting with the Sunday Times investigators. He said that this was a ""minor breach"" of the MPs' code of conduct, but that it did not warrant any further action. Mr Yeo welcomed the Commissioner's findings, saying that they ""vindicated"" his position. He said he was ""pleased"" that the investigation had been ""thorough and impartial"". The Sunday Times said it stood by its story, and that it believed Mr Yeo had ""abused his position"" as an MP. The case is a reminder of the importance of MPs following the MPs' code of conduct. The code is designed to ensure that MPs act in the public interest, and that they do not use their position for personal gain. The Commissioner's findings will be seen as a blow to the Sunday Times, which has been campaigning for tougher action against MPs who are alleged to have broken the MPs' code of conduct. The case is also likely to raise questions about the role of the Standards Commissioner. Some critics have argued that the Commissioner is too lenient on MPs, and that it is not doing enough to uphold the MPs' code of conduct.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Social media users are being urged to get involved and change their display pictures and to use the hashtags #ProudBoys and #ProudBoysUSA to prevent hate groups from promoting their messages. The group's name has been hijacked by LGBT groups and others online after a recent incident between members of the far-right group and protesters in Portland, Oregon. The group gained notoriety after its participation in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Proud Boys is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group has denied being white supremacist, but it has ties to white nationalists and has frequently engaged in violence. The group originated from the street brawls of Portland, Oregon, with members providing security for white supremacist speakers such as Gavin McInnes. According to its website, the group is made up of ""Western chauvinists"" who want to ""reclaim the West"". The group's members are known for their black-and-yellow Fred Perry polo shirts, which have become a symbol of the far-right.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Birmingham bin strike: Council 'backtracking on deal',"Unite said the council was sending out refuse trucks without ""leading hands"", who operate at the back of vehicles. It said the issue was ""at the heart"" of the dispute, as some drivers were being asked to carry out duties that were not part of their role. ""The council is backtracking on the deal that was agreed,"" said John Richards, Unite's regional officer. ""We're not going to accept that."" The council said it was ""disappointed"" that Unite had decided to continue the strike. It said it had been ""engaging constructively"" with the union and had offered a ""fair and reasonable"" pay deal. ""We are committed to finding a resolution to this dispute and we urge Unite to reconsider its position,"" said a council spokesperson. The strike is causing disruption across Birmingham, with rubbish piling up in the streets. The council has said it is doing everything it can to minimise the impact on residents, but it has warned that the strike could continue for some time. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial disputes in the UK. Workers in a number of sectors, including rail, transport, and education, have gone on strike in recent months in protest at pay and conditions. The government has said it is ""disappointed"" by the strike action and has urged unions to work with employers to find a resolution. However, unions have said that they are not prepared to accept below-inflation pay offers. The strikes are a sign of growing discontent among workers in the UK. The cost of living crisis has put a strain on household budgets, and many workers are feeling that their wages are not keeping pace with inflation. The strikes are likely to continue in the coming months, as unions and employers try to find a compromise. However, it is unclear how long the strikes will last or what impact they will have on the UK economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Council demanded payment card details via email,"Islington Council had required residents to share the security code from the rear of their cards, as well as their card number and expiry date, before being able to access services including paying council tax or reporting repairs. The council said these details were required to provide an extra layer of security as residents were able to set up accounts to view and pay their bills without registering a password. ""This is an optional process and residents can still make payments via our website, phone or in person without providing these details,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. However, once shared, the information could potentially have been used by fraudsters to make purchases online. ""Sharing the three-digit CVV number, which is used to verify card payments online and over the phone, is never a good idea,"" said David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky. ""Even if your council asks for it, it should raise an alarm bell. There are far more secure ways to provide additional authorisation."" The council said it was reviewing its processes after receiving complaints from residents and advice from a data protection officer. A freedom of information request by the BBC revealed that Islington Council had received 162 complaints from residents about data security since 2019. However, the council insisted that no payment card details had been compromised as a result of the email demand. ""Protecting residents' personal data and money is of paramount importance to us and we would never knowingly put residents' data at risk,"" the spokesperson said. The council also said it was ""committed to transparency"" and had been ""open and honest"" about the process used to verify residents' identities. ""We understand that some residents may have concerns about sharing this information, and we are therefore reviewing our processes to identify alternative ways of providing additional authorisation,"" the spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New Zealand's Dunedin jokes about losing 'steepest street' title,"For years, Dunedin's Baldwin Street proudly held that title, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records. But on Tuesday, the accolade went to a little lane in the Welsh town of Harlech. The new steepest street, Ffordd Pen Llech, has a gradient of 37.45%, compared to Baldwin Street's 34.8%. Dunedin Mayor Aaron Hawkins took the news with good humor, joking that he would be sending a ""wee bit of coal"" to Harlech to help them ""keep their fires burning"". ""We're not going to begrudge them the title,"" Hawkins said. ""We've had a good run, and it's time for someone else to have a turn."" Baldwin Street has been a popular tourist attraction for years, with people flocking from all over the world to see the ""steepest street in the world."" But locals say they're not too worried about losing the title. ""It's still a pretty steep street,"" said one resident. ""And it's still a lot of fun to walk up and down."" Others agreed, saying that the title didn't really matter. ""It's still a beautiful street, and it's still a part of our community,"" said another resident. ""We're not going to let a little thing like this change that."" In fact, some people say that losing the title could actually be a good thing for Dunedin. ""It might make us more unique,"" said one resident. ""We're not just the steepest street in the world anymore. We're the second steepest."" Whatever happens, Dunedin residents are determined to make the most of their city's unique feature. ""We're proud of Baldwin Street,"" said Mayor Hawkins. ""And we're going to keep celebrating it, no matter what."" In the meantime, Harlech residents are enjoying their newfound fame. ""It's great to be the new home of the steepest street in the world,"" said one resident. ""We're hoping it will bring more tourists to our town."" Only time will tell whether Harlech can keep its title. But for now, the Welsh town is enjoying its moment in the spotlight.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Tate Britain hits £45m renovation target,"Nine of the building's gallery rooms are being refurbished, as are the entrance area and other public spaces. The target was reached with a £5m donation from the Dorset Foundation, set up by the late philanthropist Sir John Paul Getty Jr. Tate's director Maria Balshaw said: ""This £45m fundraising success is a magnificent achievement and I am enormously grateful to all of our donors for their incredible support. ""This major refurbishment will transform the visitor experience and enable us to share more of the national collection of British art with our audiences. We can't wait to welcome visitors back to Tate Britain in 2023."" The redevelopment will include new artworks and displays, as well as improved accessibility and facilities. It is the first major refurbishment of the building since it opened in 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. The gallery is home to works by some of the UK's most famous artists, including JMW Turner, John Constable and Francis Bacon. The renovation project is expected to be completed in 2023. The Dorset Foundation is a charitable trust that supports a wide range of causes, including the arts, education and healthcare. Its donation to Tate Britain is the largest single donation the gallery has ever received. Sir John Paul Getty Jr was an American billionaire who lived in the UK for many years. He was a passionate collector of art and donated many works to Tate Britain. He died in 2003 and left a large bequest to the Dorset Foundation. The foundation's donation to Tate Britain will help to ensure that the gallery can continue to share its world-class collection with the public for many years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tropical forests 'better managed',"By Richard Black Environment correspondent, BBC News The area under some form of sustainable management plan increased by about 50% over the period; but about 90% of tropical forest is still managed under no plan at all. In addition, the researchers highlight three main areas of concern: - Deforestation: Primary forest loss increased by 40%, with the vast majority of it in the tropics. - Fragmentation: Forests are increasingly being broken up into ever-smaller blocks, which can damage their ecological function. - Species on the move: Major tree species are moving towards the poles at faster rates than ever - about 4.2km per decade on average since the early 2000s. This could have major implications for the functioning of forest ecosystems. The study used a range of publicly available data, including high-resolution satellite images. Some of this is available for free, which enabled the researchers to repeat previous assessments and see how the situation was changing. ""We're trying to track the state of the world's forests on the basis of the best available information,"" Prof Hansen told BBC News. ""It's not perfect and there are gaps, but it's the first consistent global picture,"" he said. The paper's lead author, Prof Nate McDowell of the University of Virginia, told BBC News: ""One of the striking things, particularly in the tropics, is the fragmentation of the forest. ""We are seeing this pretty substantial increase over time. And this is related to deforestation, and it's also related to the development of infrastructure - roads and agriculture. ""These fragmentation effects can lead to a suite of negative impacts on the forest, affecting things like biodiversity, carbon storage and hydrological function,"" he explained. The research team say their findings show that there has been limited progress towards implementing sustainable forest management in the tropics - but they are hopeful that the information they have provided could strengthen global efforts to protect the world's forests. ""Our results suggest the international community still has a long way to go in reaching its goal of sustainable forest management,"" said Prof McDowell. ""But they also highlight the fact that there have been some positive changes, and they provide evidence that could be used to further improve tropical forest management.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Artist's designs for Alabama church bombing window on display,"The bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan was a new low in the fight for civil rights. As news spread around the world, the international community was horrified, and the FBI launched a massive investigation. In the aftermath of the bombing, the congregation of the 16th Street Baptist Church was determined to rebuild. They commissioned a new stained-glass window to replace the one that had been destroyed. The window, designed by artist John T. Riddle, Jr., was unveiled in 1964. Riddle's window is a powerful and moving work of art. It depicts the events of the bombing, as well as the aftermath of the tragedy. The window is a reminder of the senseless violence that occurred that day, and it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing remains one of the most heinous crimes of the civil rights era. Riddle's window serves as a reminder of that day, and it is a powerful symbol of hope and renewal. In addition to the window, the church also commissioned a new set of bells, which were cast from the metal of the original bells that had been destroyed in the bombing. The new bells were dedicated in 1965, and they have been ringing ever since. The 16th Street Baptist Church has become a national historic landmark, and it is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. The church is a reminder of the civil rights movement, and it is a symbol of hope and reconciliation. The church bombing is still a painful memory for many people in Birmingham, but the city has made great strides in race relations since that day. The city has elected its first black mayor, and it has a diverse population that is working together to build a better future. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing was a tragedy, but it also helped to galvanize the civil rights movement.

Deepfake queen prompts 200-plus complaints to Ofcom,"The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. But commentators said the jokes went too far and trivialised the issue. Ofcom said the complaints were about the use of the technology to portray Her Majesty as a ""puppet"", making offensive remarks, and performing sexual acts. The regulator said it was assessing the complaints against its broadcasting rules before deciding whether to launch a formal investigation. The programme was part of a two-part series called The Age of the Algorithm, which examined the impact of artificial intelligence on society. In the programme, a deepfake of the Queen was used to deliver a speech at the opening of Parliament, in which she made a number of outrageous claims, including that she had abolished the monarchy and nationalised all the banks. The BBC said the programme was intended to be a ""thought-provoking and entertaining"" look at the potential dangers of deepfake technology. ""The programme was not intended to be a factual account of events, and we believe that the use of a deepfake of the Queen was a legitimate way to explore the issue of fake news,"" a BBC spokesperson said. ""We understand that some viewers found the programme to be offensive, and we apologise for any offence caused."" However, the programme was met with widespread criticism, with many commentators accusing the BBC of trivialising the issue of fake news. ""This was a crass and irresponsible stunt by the BBC,"" said James Ball, a technology reporter for The Guardian. ""It's one thing to use deepfake technology to make a point about the dangers of fake news, but it's quite another to use it to mock the Queen."" ""The BBC should be ashamed of itself for this,"" said Richard Eden, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph. ""This was a gratuitous attack on the monarchy and a betrayal of public trust."" The Ofcom complaints are the latest in a series of controversies over the use of deepfake technology. In 2018, a deepfake of former US President Barack Obama was used to create a video in which he appeared to make racist and sexist remarks. The video was widely shared on social media, and it raised concerns about the potential for deepfake technology to be used to spread misinformation and propaganda. Ofcom has previously warned broadcasters about the need to be responsible when using deepfake technology. In 2019, the regulator published a report on the use of deepfakes in the media, which said that broadcasters should take steps to ensure that audiences are aware that they are watching a deepfake, and that the content is not presented as being real.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Islamic State claims Kabul's latest deadly attacks,"On Wednesday, 48 people were killed in the bombing of an education centre. Most of them were students studying for university entrance exams. The attack, the deadliest in Kabul since the US withdrawal a year ago, has been claimed by Islamic State. The group said in a statement that it had targeted ""a gathering of apostates"". The attack was the latest in a series of bombings targeting civilians in Afghanistan. In May, a bomb attack on a mosque in Kunduz killed at least 33 people. In April, a bomb attack on a hospital in Kabul killed at least 25 people. The Taliban have condemned the latest attack, calling it a ""heinous crime"". However, the group has been accused of failing to provide adequate security for civilians. The US has also condemned the attack, calling it a ""horrific act of violence"". The attack has raised concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan. The Taliban have been unable to stamp out the threat from Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks in recent months. The attack has also highlighted the plight of Afghan civilians, who have been bearing the brunt of the violence in the country. According to the United Nations, more than 24,000 civilians have been killed or injured in Afghanistan since 2015. The attack has also raised questions about the international community's role in Afghanistan. The US and its allies withdrew from the country a year ago, after 20 years of war. The withdrawal has left the Taliban in control of the country, and has raised concerns about the future of Afghanistan. The attack is a reminder of the challenges facing Afghanistan. The country is still struggling to recover from decades of war, and the Taliban are struggling to provide security for civilians. The international community has a role to play in helping Afghanistan to overcome these challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Couple who met on Bardsey Island to be its new wardens,"Mari Huws, 27, and Emyr Glyn Owen, 33, will be looking after Bardsey Island off the Llŷn Peninsula from September. The couple replace Chris and Beca Williams, who were the island's wardens for over a decade. Mari, a former primary school teacher from Gaerwen, on Anglesey, and Emyr, a freelance forestry worker from Beddgelert in Gwynedd, met on Bardsey in 2018 while they were both volunteering for the island's conservation charity, The Bardsey Island Trust. They were drawn to the island's unique atmosphere and natural beauty and have been returning regularly ever since. Now, they are excited to take on the role of wardens and play their part in looking after this special place. ""We're both passionate about the island and its wildlife, and we believe it's important to protect and conserve this unique environment,"" said Mari. ""We're also looking forward to meeting and working with the many visitors who come to Bardsey each year."" Emyr added: ""We're grateful to Chris and Beca for all the hard work they've done over the years. They've been amazing wardens and we're looking forward to building on their legacy."" As wardens of Bardsey Island, Mari and Emyr will be responsible for a range of duties, including: Welcoming and informing visitors Maintaining the island's infrastructure Carrying out conservation work Monitoring the island's wildlife Acting as ambassadors for the island They will also be working closely with the Bardsey Island Trust to help protect and manage the island and its wildlife. Bardsey, also known as Ynys Enlli, is a small tidal island situated two miles off the tip of the Llŷn Peninsula. It is home to a variety of wildlife and is a popular destination for birdwatchers and nature lovers. Visitors to the island can also explore the ruins of a medieval monastery and a Victorian lighthouse. The island has a long and rich history, and has been inhabited for centuries. It is said that 20,000 saints are buried on the island, and it was once a place of pilgrimage. Bardsey is also a popular destination for day-trippers and campers. There is a small campsite on the island, and visitors can also stay in the former lighthouse keepers' cottages. The island is accessible by boat from Aberdaron.

UK interest rates remain at record low of 0.5%,"It has also decided not to extend its quantitative easing programme, designed to stimulate lending in the economy, beyond the £375bn already spent. Rates have been at this record low since March 2009 and the Bank said it would keep them there until the end of 2016. The decision to keep rates on hold comes despite the UK economy growing at its fastest rate for a decade and inflation rising to 2.9%, above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Bank said that while the economy was growing, it was still too early to raise rates. The decision was made by a 7-2 majority, with two members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voting to raise rates by 0.25%. The Bank also said that it would continue to monitor the economy closely and would raise rates when it judged that the time was right. The decision to keep rates on hold is likely to be welcomed by businesses and consumers, as it will help to keep borrowing costs low. However, it is also likely to disappoint savers, who have seen the value of their savings eroded by low interest rates. The Bank of England's decision to keep rates on hold is a sign that it is still cautious about the UK economy. The Bank is worried that raising rates too quickly could damage the recovery. However, the Bank is also aware that keeping rates too low for too long could lead to inflation getting out of control. The Bank's decision is a balancing act between supporting the economy and keeping inflation under control. The Bank will need to continue to monitor the economy closely and make further decisions on interest rates in the months and years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

BBC World Service to lose 73 jobs,"25 jobs will go on the English-language service with news coverage reduced from 18 hours to 14 each weekday. Arts show The Strand will be axed from April next year, while World Briefing will end in the spring. The corporation said the move was necessary to make savings in the wake of a £285m funding cut recently imposed by the government. In a statement, the BBC said it was committed to continuing to provide ""high-quality, impartial and independent journalism"" to audiences around the world. ""These changes are essential to ensure that the BBC World Service remains sustainable and relevant for the future,"" the statement said. The job cuts are part of a wider restructuring of the BBC World Service, which will see the corporation focus on its digital and mobile platforms. The BBC said it was investing in new technology to improve the user experience and make its content more accessible to audiences around the world. The cuts to the English-language service will be phased in over the next year. The Strand, which has been broadcast for over 20 years, will end in April next year. World Briefing will also end in the spring. The BBC said it would continue to produce other arts and culture programming, such as The Documentary and Witness. The corporation said it was committed to ""exploring new ways to inform, educate and entertain audiences"" around the world.

GP concern over Betsi Cadwaladr board's hospital plan,"But Dr Phillip Banfield said the proposals were the harsh reality of Wales' ""health care rationing debate"". Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) is the first in Wales to set out plans that would see two full-time consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology units, and a neonatal unit, at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The proposals are part of a wider plan for the future of health and care in North Wales, and were put out for public consultation on Thursday. The plans would mean four general hospitals in North Wales - Ysbyty Gwynedd, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Wrexham Maelor Hospital, and Ysbyty Maelor Wrecsam - receiving specific services in a bid to create specialist centres that provide the best possible care for patients. Under the plans, Ysbyty Gwynedd would become a planned surgical centre for heart surgery - at present the hospital only carries out emergency heart surgery - and would also specialise in cancer care and a range of other services. Ysbyty Glan Clwyd would become the region's emergency medical centre, providing acute stroke care, trauma services, and respiratory care, among other things. Wrexham Maelor Hospital would become the planned surgical centre for non-heart surgery, and would also provide renal dialysis, some of the region's breast cancer services, and would be the main centre for musculoskeletal services. Dr Phillip Banfield, chair of the BCUHB, said the new model of care would involve ""rethinking the way we deliver services"" but said the board believes it would deliver ""high quality and safe care"" for patients in North Wales. ""The plans represent the culmination of 18 months of work and listening to our staff, our patients, and our communities,"" he said. ""The plans will see us create specialist centres in North Wales that will provide the best care for patients locally and reduce the need for patients to travel outside of the region for treatment."" He added: ""The plans are designed to ensure all of our hospitals are providing the right care in the right place, and that our patients receive the best possible treatment by highly-skilled teams that specialise in a particular area."" The board said it has invested heavily in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital to provide the ""appropriate infrastructure and equipment"" necessary to deliver this new model of service provision. The plans are currently out for public consultation, and BCUHB said it will ""carefully consider"" all of the feedback it receives before making any final decisions. The consultation will close on March 9, 2023.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Charity's 'concern' at number of beavers culled in Scotland,"The Scottish Wildlife Trust said the impact of the cull, estimated at about a fifth of the beaver population, could be ""quite significant"". But Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which authorised the cull, said it was necessary to manage the beaver population and prevent damage to the environment and infrastructure. The beavers were introduced to Scotland in the 1990s as part of a conservation project. They have since spread to other parts of the country, and their numbers have increased rapidly. Beavers are known to dam rivers, which can cause flooding and damage to property. They can also damage trees and crops. SNH said the cull was carried out in response to concerns from landowners and other stakeholders about the impact of beavers on their property and livelihoods. The cull was carried out by licensed trappers, and the beavers were killed humanely. The Scottish Wildlife Trust said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the cull. The trust said the cull could have a negative impact on the beaver population in Scotland, and could also damage the wider ecosystem. The trust said it was calling on SNH to review its beaver management strategy and to consider alternative methods of managing the beaver population, such as relocation or contraception. SNH said it would continue to monitor the beaver population in Scotland and would carry out further culls if necessary. The agency said it was committed to managing the beaver population in a way that balances the needs of conservation with the needs of landowners and other stakeholders. The debate over how to manage the beaver population in Scotland is likely to continue. The cull has highlighted the need for a long-term strategy for managing beavers in Scotland, and for a balance to be struck between the needs of conservation and the needs of landowners and other stakeholders.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scottish government funding for youth unemployment priority areas,"The Scottish government has announced the priority areas set to benefit from its youth employment strategy fund. Glasgow, Renfrewshire, North and South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde will receive a share of £9 million to tackle youth unemployment. The fund is part of the government's £100 million Youth Guarantee scheme, which aims to provide all young people in Scotland with the opportunity to access education, training or employment. The priority areas were selected based on a range of factors, including the number of young people unemployed, the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET), and the local economy. The funding will be used to support a range of projects, including: Providing pre-employment training and work experience opportunities for young people Creating new apprenticeships and other job opportunities Supporting young people to start their own businesses The Scottish government hopes that the fund will help to reduce youth unemployment and give young people the skills and experience they need to succeed in the workplace. In addition to the priority areas, the fund will also be used to support a range of national projects, such as: A new national youth employment agency A website providing information and advice on youth employment A social media campaign to promote youth employment The Scottish government is committed to tackling youth unemployment and giving young people the best possible start in life. The Youth Employment Strategy Fund is a key part of this commitment. The fund is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs for young people and help to reduce youth unemployment by up to 5%.

Read all about it: The online newspaper archive,"The British Library's newspaper archive at Colindale in north London has long been a place of pilgrimage for writers. They've come to search for historical nuggets that can illuminate the present. But now, it's all accessible online, and the first 40 million pages are available free of charge. The digitisation project began 15 years ago and has been gathering momentum ever since, thanks to technology which makes it possible to scan the fragile newsprint without causing any damage. Over 400 UK newspapers are represented, covering more than 300 years of history. In 1900, there were more than 2,500 papers published in the UK - many of them local titles that reported on events of only passing interest. But there are also the big hitters - national titles like The Times and the Daily Telegraph. And of course, the regional papers that are so essential for local historians. The library hopes to digitise every last page, and so far, they've covered 178 regional titles. They include the Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), which published the first reports of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. There's also the Liverpool Mercury, which reported on the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. And the Western Daily Press, which carried the first reports of the Bristol Bus Boycott in 1963. The digitisation project has revealed some surprising facts. In 1812, for example, there was an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Spencer Perceval. The Times reported the story, but only as a paragraph on page 3. The bigger story of the day was the execution of a group of Luddites in Yorkshire. The online archive is now a treasure trove for researchers and anyone with an interest in the past. I started my own search by looking for stories about my home town, Cardiff. I found reports of the opening of the new Cardiff Arms Park in 1921. There's a detailed account of a rugby match between Wales and New Zealand in 1935. And I found a fascinating story about the theft of a tram in 1945. I also used the archive to track down the reports of my own birth in 1952. My mother had told me that it was a difficult birth and I was lucky to survive. The Western Mail reported that I was born ""after a long and anxious confinement"". It was a relief to read that I was ""doing well"". The online archive is a remarkable resource and it's free to use.

The council's street naming and numbering policy states that apostrophes should not be used in street names, except in cases where the name is a direct quote or is an established historical name. The policy also states that street names should be concise, easy to spell and pronounce, and should not be offensive or confusing. The council said the removal of apostrophes from new street names would make them easier to read, understand, and navigate. The council also said it would help to avoid confusion and ambiguity, particularly in the case of streets that are named after people or places. The ban on apostrophes in Devon's new street names has been welcomed by some residents and businesses in the area. Peter Smith, a resident of Tiverton, said he supported the council's decision to remove apostrophes from street names. ""I think it's a good idea,"" Smith said. ""Apostrophes can be confusing and unnecessary. It's easier to read and understand street names without them."" Sarah Jones, a business owner in Crediton, said she also supported the council's decision. ""I think it's a good move,"" Jones said. ""It will make it easier for customers to find my business, and it will also help to create a more consistent and professional look for the area."" While some residents and businesses have welcomed the council's decision to ban apostrophes from new street names, others have expressed concerns. John Brown, a historian from Exeter, said he was concerned that the ban could lead to the loss of important historical information. ""Apostrophes can be used to indicate possession or ownership,"" Brown said. ""By removing them from street names, we could be losing valuable information about the history of our towns and villages."" The council said it understood the concerns of those who opposed the ban on apostrophes, but it believed that the benefits of the new policy outweighed the risks. ""We believe that the removal of apostrophes from new street names will make them easier to read, understand, and navigate,"" a council spokesperson said. ""We also believe it will help to avoid confusion and ambiguity, particularly in the case of streets that are named after people or places."" The council said it would be reviewing the new policy in the future to ensure that it is working effectively.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Bill Clinton regrets 'three strikes' bill,"Speaking to a civil rights group, he said: ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it."" It put 100,000 more people in prison, and for longer. Clinton backed a crime bill in 1994 that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences, including drug-related crimes. ""We had a huge crime problem, more kids were being killed… crack cocaine was ravaging poor communities,"" he said. ""But it wasn't just that bad judgment, we had this idea that the way to do it is just lock 'em all up. And we did, 100,000 more people – mostly African-Americans."" The 1994 crime bill was designed to tackle a surge in violent crime in the US. The law expanded federal funding for prisons and created new mandatory minimum sentences for certain offenses. Critics argue that the law led to mass incarceration, particularly among African-Americans. Clinton's comments come as the US grapples with a renewed debate on criminal justice reform. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to reduce mass incarceration and address racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Clinton's admission of regret over the 1994 crime bill is a significant moment in the debate. It is a sign that the political consensus on mass incarceration is shifting. Clinton's comments are also a reminder that the criminal justice system is a complex issue with no easy solutions. While there is a need to address the problem of mass incarceration, it is also important to find ways to keep communities safe from crime. Clinton's comments suggest that he believes that it is possible to find a balance between these two goals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Former US intelligence analyst charged with leaks to media,"Daniel Everette Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tennessee, was arrested after allegedly providing at least 17 top secret documents to an unnamed journalist. According to the indictment, the files related to counterterrorism and intelligence gathering in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen. Hale, a former US Air Force intelligence analyst, worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) from 2013 to 2016. He is accused of accessing the classified documents on a secure computer system and then transmitting them to the journalist via an encrypted email account. The indictment alleges that Hale knew the documents were classified and that their unauthorized disclosure could cause ""grave damage"" to the United States. It also claims that he had a ""pattern of unauthorized access to classified information"" while working at the NSA. Hale's arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile prosecutions of government employees accused of leaking classified information to the media. In 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about the agency's surveillance programs, prompting a global debate about privacy and security. Hale's case is different from Snowden's in that he is not accused of leaking documents to a foreign government or of directly harming national security. However, the charges against him are still serious and could result in a lengthy prison sentence. Hale's arrest has drawn criticism from some who argue that he is being prosecuted for whistleblowing. They say that the documents he leaked revealed important information about the US government's counterterrorism operations and that he was acting in the public interest. However, the government maintains that Hale violated the law by leaking classified information and that his actions put the country at risk. The trial is expected to begin in the spring of 2023. Hale's case is a reminder of the tension between the public's right to know and the government's need to protect sensitive information. It is a complex issue with no easy answers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Army morale declining, Ministry of Defence survey shows","Thirty per cent of army personnel described their morale as low - up from 26% last year - the report showed. And the proportion of personnel who said they would recommend the army as a career had also decreased, from 68% last year to 64%. The annual survey of 12,000 serving personnel, carried out by researchers at King's College London, found that morale had declined across all ranks and services. The army's chief of the general staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""We know that morale is a key factor in operational effectiveness, and we are committed to addressing the issues that are driving down morale,"" he said. The survey found that the most common factors driving down morale were: Pay and allowances Career progression Training and development Workload Leadership Sanders said the army was taking a number of steps to address these issues, including: Increasing pay and allowances Investing in career progression Improving training and development Reducing workload Strengthening leadership He said the army was also working to improve the welfare support available to personnel and their families. ""We are committed to creating an army that is attractive to serve in, and we will continue to work hard to address the issues that are affecting morale,"" he said. However, the report also found that there were some areas where morale had improved. For example, the proportion of personnel who said they were satisfied with their accommodation had increased from 72% last year to 76%. The report also found that morale was higher among personnel who had been deployed on operations. This suggests that the army's focus on operational effectiveness is having a positive impact on morale. Overall, the report provides a mixed picture of morale in the army. While there are some areas where morale has improved, there are also some areas where morale is declining. The army is taking a number of steps to address the issues that are driving down morale, but it is clear that more needs to be done.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fishing boat discards 'hard to comply with',"Boats having to land unwanted fish caught in their nets started being phased in at the start of the year, under European laws. Throwing dead fish back into the sea had previously been widespread, in part because it was easier and cheaper than bringing it ashore. But environmentalists have long argued that discarding large quantities of fish at sea damages the marine ecosystem, removing food from other creatures and making the seabed a less hospitable environment. The new rules, which have been controversial, say that discarding fish likely to survive if returned to the sea is forbidden, as well as fish that are below a set size. In the case of herring, for example, any fish below 8cm long cannot be thrown away. But the industry says it is very difficult to measure and check every catch at sea, and that the new rules could lead to extra costs and bureaucracy. ""There have been boats coming into land with [under-sized] fish but not discarding them, which used to be the legal way to do it,"" said Dr Paul Trebilco, the Marine Conservation Society's (MCS) head of policy. ""Now they're under an obligation to land and sell it."" But he acknowledged that the new rules could also lead to some fishermen disregarding them and discarding anyway. ""This regulation is a pragmatic measure to help stop the dumping of dead fish at sea and to tackle overfishing,"" he said. ""The fact is we simply cannot afford to waste fish."" Richard Benyon, the environment minister, sagte, the government was aware of the industry's concerns, and that it was ""working with the industry to help them comply with the new regulations"". He told the BBC: ""We want to make sure we have a sustainable fishing industry, and we want to make sure that the fish that come out of our seas are used in the best possible way."" The rules were first announced in 2013, and have been phased in over the course of this year. The full ban comes into force on 1 January 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ed Sheeran stops sell-out Cardiff concert for the toilet - twice,"The Grammy award winning singer halted his Saturday night set in Cardiff because he ""needed a pee"" after performing his smash hit Galway Girl. Then three songs later Sheeran stopped in the middle of singing Photograph, telling the packed Principality Stadium crowd: ""I'm going for another wee."" Sheeran, 30, has previously spoken of his embarrassing bladder problems and in his 2017 track Castle On The Hill, he sings about ""having to pee"" during a date. After he left the stage for the second time on Saturday, his backing singers began playing a cover of Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger. But Sheeran returned after about three minutes to finish his set, jokingly telling the crowd: ""I'm not leaving you again. You're stuck with me now."" He added: ""Whoever thought of putting portable toilets so far away? How do you have a site this big with a stage this big and the toilets are a 15-minute walk away? ""I'm going to have to have a word. This is a health and safety issue."" But Sheeran's toilet breaks did not appear to dampen the spirits of the 74,000 fans inside Cardiff's Principality Stadium. ""It's our Ed, isn't it?"" said one fan. ""He's real, isn't he?"" Sheeran's concert was part of his Mathematics world tour and it was his first in the UK since 2018. He ended Saturday's set with his hit Perfect while fireworks filled the night sky. ""Absolutely unreal,"" said fan Kirstie Hopkins. ""He was amazing and so so funny with it. ""I'm glad he told us why he had to go - I'd hate to think he'd just left. He's such a down to earth performer."" Sheeran had also been due to play at the Principality Stadium on Friday night but that concert was postponed because of bad weather. He told the crowd: ""I'm sorry again about last night. I hated to do it but it was dangerous, lightning and all that. ""I feel bad, but the people who came last night get a double treat.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Libya civil war: UN envoy Salamé says foreign intervention must end,"On the eve of peace talks in Berlin, Mr Salamé said foreign support of proxy groups in the conflict had created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence. But Mr Haftar, who is based in eastern Libya and is backed by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, rejected the ceasefire. The escalation of foreign involvement in Libya has raised fears that the conflict could become a wider proxy war. The UN has warned that the fighting could lead to a ""catastrophic"" humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced and shortages of food, water and medicine. The Berlin talks are seen as a last-ditch effort to find a political solution to the conflict. But it is unclear whether the warring parties are willing to compromise. Mr Salamé said that he hoped the talks would produce a ""road map"" for a ceasefire and a political settlement. ""We are at a critical moment in Libya's history,"" he said. ""The future of the country is at stake. We cannot afford to fail."" The conflict in Libya began in 2011 with the overthrow of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. Since then, the country has been plagued by violence and political instability. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has struggled to assert its authority over the whole country. The GNA is headquartered in the capital, Tripoli, and is supported by Turkey and Qatar. It is opposed by the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is led by Mr Haftar and is based in eastern Libya. The LNA has made significant gains in recent months, and now controls much of eastern and southern Libya. The GNA has been weakened by defections and internal divisions. The international community has been divided on how to respond to the conflict in Libya. Some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have called for a ceasefire and a political settlement. Others, such as Russia and the United Arab Emirates, have supported Mr Haftar's military campaign. The UN has called for an end to foreign intervention in Libya and for the warring parties to negotiate a political settlement. But it is unclear whether the parties are willing to compromise. The Berlin talks are seen as a last-ditch effort to find a solution to the conflict, but it is unclear whether they will be successful.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sri Lanka met Ban ki Moon panel,"The meeting in New York was not announced to the media by either the UNSG or the Sri Lankan government. ""The panel members took part in a discussion along with an officer named Lynn Pascoe (United States as the Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs) and met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the UN who now holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council,"" the source explained. This source, who wished to remain anonymous, said that during the meeting the panel members expressed their wish to visit Sri Lanka and requested the government's consent to travel to the island. The panel members requested to meet President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, as well as representatives of the opposition parties and civil society groups. The Sri Lankan government has not yet responded to the panel's request to visit the country. However, a government spokesman said that ""the government is committed to cooperating with the UN and will consider the panel's request in due course."" The panel is expected to visit Sri Lanka in the coming months to conduct its investigation. The panel is tasked with investigating allegations of human rights violations and war crimes committed during the final stages of the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war in Sri Lanka ended in May 2009 with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The war was a brutal conflict that claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 people. There have been allegations that both sides in the conflict committed human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and sexual violence. The UN panel is expected to investigate these allegations and report its findings to the UN Secretary-General. The Sri Lankan government has denied the allegations of human rights violations. However, the UN has said that it has received credible reports of such violations. The visit by the UN panel to Sri Lanka is expected to be a significant development in the ongoing debate about human rights violations in the country. The panel's findings could have a major impact on the international community's view of Sri Lanka and could lead to further pressure on the government to address the allegations of human rights violations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Halton Transport: Bus company with huge losses goes into liquidation,"Halton Transport, which runs more than a third of services across the Cheshire borough, lost almost £620,000 in 2019, up from £50,500 in 2017. Halton Borough Council said it had agreed to provide up to £3m to keep the company, which was founded in 1988, operating until the end of the month. But the council and its private sector partners said they were unable to support the business beyond March 29. About 120 jobs are now at risk. The council said it was working with Merseytravel, Transport for Greater Manchester and other bus operators to ensure the majority of Halton Transport services continue to be provided. It added that a review will be carried out of the council's public transport needs in the light of the company's collapse. Halton Transport, which is based in Runcorn, operates 50 buses on 26 routes across Halton, St Helens, Widnes and Warrington. The move represents the latest in a string of bus companies going into administration, following the collapse of several firms including Bordaline, Central Buses and Yourbus. In a statement, Halton Council said: ""Halton Transport has been operating at a financial loss for some time and despite the huge efforts made by staff and management, the company has reached a point where it can no longer continue to trade. ""The council has been working closely with the company and its private sector partners to explore all options to keep the business viable, including a request for more external funding. ""However, following a thorough review of the company's position and its prospects for the future, the council and its partners have reluctantly reached the conclusion that they are unable to support the business beyond March 29."" Council leader Rob Polhill said: ""This is a very difficult day for all the staff, customers and partners of Halton Transport. ""The council has done everything within its power to support the business, but sadly it has not been possible to secure a viable future for the company."" He added: ""The priority now is to ensure the continuation of bus services across Halton. We are working closely with other operators to put in place arrangements to cover as many of Halton Transport's routes as possible.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Will you be lonely this Christmas?,"Will you be lonely this Christmas? Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Nights spent at parties and catching up with friends, culminating with a Christmas surrounded by family. But the festive period is not like that for everyone. Age UK estimates about 450,000 will be spending this Christmas on their own, while others will have minimal contact with loved ones over the festive period. How many people are affected by loneliness? A survey for the charity found 1.4 million older people said they felt lonely some or all of the time. It warned that half of all older people have unmet social needs and more than 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or family member in more than a month. One of the groups most at risk at Christmas is widowers. They may be used to celebrating Christmas with their other half, so being alone can be particularly poignant. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said: ""The holiday season can be a very difficult time for older people. ""We know that loneliness is a huge issue for older people all year round, but Christmas and the winter months can be particularly hard. ""Loneliness can have a very negative impact on people's health and wellbeing. It can increase your risk of developing a wide range of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, depression and dementia. ""It can also make it harder to cope with the challenges of daily life, such as getting out and about or managing your finances. ""That's why it's so important that we all do what we can to help older people feel less lonely. This could involve simply reaching out to an older neighbour or relative, or volunteering with a local charity."" What can be done to help? There are a number of things that can be done to help older people feel less lonely. Reach out to them. Simply calling someone up or popping round for a cup of tea can make a big difference. Listen to them. Sometimes, all people need is someone to talk to. Offer them practical help. This could involve anything from running errands to helping them with their shopping. Encourage them to get involved in activities. This could involve anything from joining a club to volunteering. Be patient and understanding. It may take time for someone to open up about how they're feeling. Christmas can be a lonely time for many people. If you are struggling with loneliness, there are organizations that can help.

Government sets out £1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst The UK government has set out a £1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions by nearly half by 2033. It wants firms to waste less energy, develop low-carbon technologies and invest in equipment that can store captured CO2 under the North Sea. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan was a ""triple win"". It would reduce carbon emissions, cut company costs and create jobs in the UK's industrial heartlands, he said. Industrial sites account for 15% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The announcement is part of the government's strategy to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Next month, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is expected to publish a contract to find and licence a storage site under the North Sea. It will then run a competition to find the best technology to capture and store CO2 from nearby industrial sites. The new funding is likely to be measured against the government's climate commitments in the run-up to crucial UN climate talks this November in Glasgow. At the last major UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, the UK promised to reduce carbon emissions 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. The Climate Change Committee - the UK's independent climate advisory body - has said the UK needs to cut emissions faster in this decade so it can make deeper cuts later. It has called on the government to do more to cut emissions in sectors including industry and transport. The government says the new funding is part of its commitment to decarbonise the whole of the UK economy. It says the money will pay for things such as more efficient equipment, staff training and investment in low-carbon technologies. The Green Alliance think tank said the funding was a good start, but there was far more to do, especially in industries such as steel and chemicals. ""We need a strong policy framework with clear targets and deadlines to ensure that industry decarbonises quickly enough,"" said the group's deputy director Dustin Benton. The head of the Energy Systems Catapult, Pavan Sukhdev, said it was to be applauded for setting out the scale of support required for the transition. ""However, this just covers up to 2025,"" he said. The government must now develop a plan for the next phase of this journey."" Unions welcomed the funding and jobs but said the government must do more to address energy efficiency in homes and businesses. The Prospect union said: ""We believe that the government can make greater use of existing financing tools, such as the Green Homes Grant, with energy efficiency and heat decarbonisation measures as part of the broader national infrastructure plan.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Are we stuck with plastic drinking straws?,"By Louise Greenwood Business reporter John Sidanta, chief executive of Primaplast, said he was aware of rising global concern over levels of plastic pollution. ""We are looking to be ahead of the curve,"" he said, adding that research into alternatives such as paper and biodegradable straws was at an ""exploratory"" stage. ""That's the route we are aiming to go down,"" he added. But environmentalists say that this journey is taking too long. ""Single-use plastic straws are one of the most avoidable plastics,"" said Sam Chetan-Welsh, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK. ""Most people don't need them and it's so easy to find alternatives."" The UK government has pledged to ban all avoidable single-use plastics by 2042. While many restaurants and bars have stopped giving out straws unless they are requested, campaigners say this is not enough. ""The best way forward is a total ban,"" said Ms Chetan-Welsh. ""It's all very well businesses and individuals choosing to reduce their use or replace plastic, but it's really tricky on a large scale and at the end of the day it's up to the government to lead."" However, Mr Sidanta argues that a total ban would only force businesses to import single-use straws from overseas, which could have a greater environmental impact. ""It's not as simple as just banning them,"" he said. ""We need to look at the entire life cycle of a product and make sure that the alternatives are better."" Ultimately, he believes that the key lies in changing consumer behavior. ""People need to challenge their own use of products and make a conscious decision,"" he said. ""It's a combination of government, businesses and individuals working together to reduce plastic consumption."" So, are we stuck with plastic drinking straws? Not necessarily, but it may take a while to find a truly sustainable alternative. In the meantime, campaigners are urging people to refuse straws when they don't need them and to choose reusable alternatives where possible.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Labour MP quits party review group over leadership disagreement,"By Ellie Price BBC News Alison McGovern told the BBC the shadow chancellor had suggested the group she chairs, Progress, co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers. John McDonnell also accused Progress of ""trying to undermine the leadership"". In a statement, McGovern said McDonnell's accusations were ""completely untrue"" and that she was ""proud of the work that Progress has done to represent the views of Labour members and supporters"". She added: ""I have therefore taken the decision to step down as chair of Progress with immediate effect."" McGovern's resignation comes at a time of growing tension within the Labour Party over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Three shadow ministers - Ian Murray, Lucy Powell and Chris Bryant - resigned their positions earlier this week, citing concerns about Corbyn's leadership. McDonnell is a close ally of Corbyn's, and his comments about Progress suggest that he believes the group is part of a wider plot to oust the Labour leader. However, McGovern denied these claims, saying that Progress was ""not a faction"" and that it was ""committed to working for the unity of the Labour Party"". She added: ""I hope that John McDonnell will withdraw his unfounded allegations and work with Progress to build a strong and united Labour Party that can win the next election."" McDonnell has not yet responded to McGovern's resignation. The Labour Party is currently in the midst of a leadership contest, with Corbyn facing a challenge from Owen Smith. The result of the contest is due to be announced on 24 September. If Corbyn loses the contest, it is likely that there will be further resignations from the shadow cabinet. However, if he wins, it is hoped that the party will be able to unite behind him and move forward with a clear strategy for the next election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zhao Ziyang: Purged Chinese Communist reformer is buried,"The remains of Mr Zhao, who died in 2005, were interred along with those of his wife in a quiet ceremony. Mr Zhao was ousted as general secretary of the Communist Party in 1989 after opposing the use of force against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. He was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. Mr Zhao's death was met with widespread mourning in China, with many people seeing him as a symbol of hope and reform. His burial is seen as a sign of the government's willingness to rehabilitate his reputation, which had been tarnished by his association with the Tiananmen Square protests. The ceremony was attended by Mr Zhao's family and friends, as well as a number of senior government officials. The government has not released any details of the ceremony, but it is believed to have been a private affair. Mr Zhao's burial is a significant moment in Chinese history. It is a sign that the government is willing to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and to rehabilitate the reputation of those who have been unjustly persecuted. It is also a sign of the government's confidence in its own stability and its ability to manage dissent. Mr Zhao's death and burial have also sparked a renewed debate about the Tiananmen Square protests. Many people in China believe that the government was wrong to use force against the protesters, and that Mr Zhao was right to oppose it. The government has maintained that the use of force was necessary to restore order, but many people believe that the government's actions were excessive. The Tiananmen Square protests remain a sensitive issue in China, and the government continues to suppress any discussion of them. However, the burial of Mr Zhao is a sign that the government is willing to tolerate a limited amount of dissent. It is also a sign that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests is still alive in China, and that the government cannot completely erase it from history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool,"A third of GP surgeries have been told to contact people who may have been given an inaccurate assessment of their future risk of heart disease. The alert follows the discovery of a problem with a computer algorithm used to calculate risk scores. The tool, called QRISK3, is used by GPs in England to assess the risk of heart disease and stroke in people aged 20 to 84 who are not already receiving treatment. The algorithm takes into account factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family history of heart disease. The problem with the algorithm means that some people have been given an inaccurate risk score, which may have led to them being given the wrong treatment or advice. The NHS has said that it is working to fix the problem and has asked GPs to contact people who may have been affected. The glitch was discovered by researchers at the University of Oxford, who found that the algorithm was underestimating the risk of heart disease in some people, particularly those from South Asian backgrounds. The researchers said that the glitch could have affected up to 3 million people in England. The NHS has said that the glitch is being fixed and that people who have been affected will be contacted by their GP. In the meantime, people who are concerned about their risk of heart disease should speak to their GP. Dr Charmaine Griffiths, NHS England's national clinical director for heart disease, said: ""We are working to fix the problem with the QRISK3 algorithm as quickly as possible. ""We have asked GP surgeries to contact people who may have been affected and to offer them a further assessment of their risk of heart disease. ""People who are concerned about their risk of heart disease should speak to their GP."" The QRISK3 algorithm was developed by the University of Cambridge and is used by GPs in England to assess the risk of heart disease and stroke in people aged 20 to 84 who are not already receiving treatment.

Arizona wildfire: Battling the blaze,"The interagency ""hotshot"" team - of which there are a number across the US - are highly trained and equipped to work in remote locations, tackling the most challenging wildfires. They are often the first responders in the most dangerous areas, where terrain and fire conditions are most extreme. With the Tunnel fire in northern Arizona threatening the remote community of Munds Park, one team of 20 hotshots from New Mexico was deployed to help bring the fire under control. They were joined by a second 20-member team from Arizona. On 20 April, the hotshots were airlifted into a clearing close to the fire and spent the day hiking through thick vegetation, digging fire lines and removing flammable material. The aim was to starve the blaze of fuel and stop it from spreading towards the community and popular tourist destination of Flagstaff. As well as battling the fire on the ground, aircraft were also deployed to drop retardant and water on the flames. Helicopters filled their tanks from a nearby lake, flying low over the fire to dump their loads with pinpoint accuracy. Working alongside the hotshots on the ground were bulldozers and other heavy machinery, clearing vegetation to create fire breaks and widening existing roads to allow fire engines to reach the blaze. As night fell, the hotshots camped out at their remote base, ready to resume their work at daybreak. Weather conditions were mostly favourable, with light winds and no rain, but the fire was continuing to burn and they knew there was still a long way to go. The following day, the hotshots continued to dig fire lines and remove vegetation, working in shifts to ensure there was always a fresh team ready to take over. The fire had spread to around 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) but firefighters were slowly managing to bring it under control, with containment lines established around 20% of its perimeter. As the sun set on the second day of the operation, the hotshots were finally able to return to their base camp, exhausted but satisfied that they were making progress in containing the blaze.

Rain and landslides are hindering search and rescue operations there and officials in the state say more deaths are likely. The earthquake shook the Sikkim state, which borders Nepal and Tibet, at around midday local time. It measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and was felt across the region, including in the Indian capital, New Delhi. In Nepal, at least 12 people were killed and dozens injured. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse in the capital, Kathmandu, and there are fears that the death toll could rise as rescue workers reach remote areas. In Tibet, at least one person was killed and several others injured. The earthquake caused damage to buildings and infrastructure in the region, and there are fears that the death toll could rise as rescue workers reach remote areas. The earthquake has caused widespread damage across the region, and relief workers are struggling to reach remote areas. The Indian government has deployed disaster response teams to Sikkim and Nepal, and international aid agencies are also sending assistance. The earthquake is a reminder of the seismic risks facing the region. The Himalayas are a seismically active area, and there have been several major earthquakes in the region in recent years. In 2015, a major earthquake struck Nepal, killing more than 8,000 people. In 2019, a major earthquake struck Sikkim, killing more than 100 people. Scientists say that the region is at risk of further major earthquakes, and they are urging governments and communities to prepare for such events.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study,"Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study Air pollution contributes to 40,000 early deaths each year in the UK and we gulp in more of it when we exercise. On the other hand, regular exercise reduces the risk of diabetes, heart and lung disease, and early death. So what are the risks and benefits of cycling and walking in polluted cities? A new study published in the journal Environment International has found that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution, even in cities with high levels of pollution. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study, which included over 500,000 adults. They looked at the participants' levels of physical activity, air pollution exposure, and health outcomes. They found that people who cycled or walked regularly had a lower risk of death from all causes, including death from heart disease, stroke, cancer, and respiratory disease. The researchers also found that the benefits of cycling and walking were greater than the risks from air pollution, even in cities with high levels of pollution. In fact, the benefits were greatest in cities with the highest levels of pollution. The study provides strong evidence that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution. This is important news, as it means that people can still enjoy the benefits of exercise, even in polluted cities. However, the study also found that air pollution can have a negative impact on lung function. The researchers found that people who were exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower lung function than people who were exposed to low levels of air pollution. This suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development of respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. The study's findings are consistent with other research that has found that the health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the risks from air pollution. However, the study's findings are particularly important because they are based on a large sample size and because they looked at the effects of air pollution on a wide range of health outcomes. The study's findings have important implications for public health policy. The findings suggest that policymakers should encourage people to cycle and walk more, even in polluted cities. The findings also suggest that policymakers should take steps to reduce air pollution levels in cities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nora Ephron remembered at star-packed memorial,"Ephron, whose hit films include When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, died last month aged 71. 800 friends and family were invited to the Lincoln Center, including heavyweights from the worlds of film, television, music and politics. A teary-eyed Meryl Streep read a moving letter in tribute to her long-time friend, saying she was ""wildly funny, unsparingly honest and fiercely loyal."" ""Her writing had that rare ability to make you laugh and cry at the same time,"" said Streep, who starred in many of Ephron's films. Another close friend, Meg Ryan, said: ""She taught me more about life, men and shoes than any other woman alive."" Ryan, who starred in Ephron's romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle, recalled how the writer had once told her: ""Life is never what you expect and people will disappoint you over and over again, but pancakes never disappoint."" Ephron's wit and wisdom was also remembered by her son, Max Handelman, who said: ""My mother taught me that you should always get your heartbroken because it makes you a better writer."" He added: ""She also taught me that you should always wear sunscreen and never trust a man who doesn't like dogs."" Other speakers at the memorial included Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Diane Keaton and Oprah Winfrey. Spielberg said Ephron was ""one of the most brilliant and original voices of our time."" ""Her films were not just about love and relationships, they were about the human condition,"" he said. Hanks, who starred in Ephron's romantic comedy You've Got Mail, said: ""Nora was a master at capturing the complexities of human relationships."" ""She could make you laugh and cry in the same breath,"" he said. Keaton, who starred in Ephron's comedy-drama Hanging Up, said: ""Nora was a true friend and a brilliant writer."" ""She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,"" she said. Winfrey, who was a close friend of Ephron's, said: ""Nora was a one-of-a-kind talent."" ""She was a brilliant writer, a gifted director and a wonderful friend,"" she said. ""She will be remembered for her wit, her wisdom and her love of life.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"European elections 2019: Remainers are angry too, says Vince Cable","The Lib Dem leader told the BBC that young people felt their future had been ""taken away from them by a generation that were born in the war"" through Brexit. ""They're the ones that will suffer in the long term. Their wages won't go up, their life chances won't be as good,"" he said. Cable also said that former Labour voters were angry at the party for not giving them a second referendum. ""They feel betrayed by Labour,"" he said. ""They feel that Labour has abandoned them."" The Lib Dems are targeting Remain-voting Labour supporters in seats across the country. The party is hoping to win back some of the seats it lost to Labour in the 2017 general election. The European elections are taking place on 23 May. The Lib Dems are hoping to do well in the elections, and they are hoping to use the results to push for a second referendum on Brexit. The European elections are the first nationwide poll since the 2017 general election. The results of the elections will be seen as a test of public opinion on Brexit. The Lib Dems are not the only party targeting Remain-voting Labour supporters. The Green Party is also hoping to win over these voters. The Greens are hoping to build on their success in the local elections in May, when they won control of Brighton and Hove City Council. The European elections are likely to be closely fought. The Lib Dems, the Greens, and the Brexit Party are all hoping to do well in the elections. The results of the elections could have a significant impact on the future of Brexit. If the Lib Dems and the Greens do well in the elections, it could increase pressure on the government to hold a second referendum. However, if the Brexit Party does well, it could strengthen the government's position and make it less likely that there will be a second referendum. The European elections are an important opportunity for voters to have their say on Brexit.

Tony Nicklinson's 'courage' will lead to law change,"Mr Nicklinson, a man with locked-in syndrome who fought to legally end his life, died on Wednesday. Lord Joffe, a right-to-die campaigner, said the law needs to be changed and ""MPs should reflect the views of the nation"". Nicklinson was diagnosed with the condition in 2005 after suffering a stroke. He was unable to move or speak, and communicated through a computer using eye-tracking technology. In 2012, he launched a legal challenge against the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), arguing that the ban on assisted suicide was a breach of his human rights. The High Court ruled against him, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision in 2014. However, the Supreme Court ruled against Nicklinson in 2015. Lord Joffe said Nicklinson's ""courage"" would lead to a change in the law. ""The public is overwhelmingly in favor of a change in the law,"" he said. ""MPs should reflect the views of the nation."" A YouGov poll in 2015 found that 82% of Britons support a change in the law on assisted suicide. The government has said it will not change the law, but it is under pressure from campaigners to do so. In 2019, the House of Commons voted in favor of a bill that would have legalized assisted suicide for terminally ill adults. However, the bill was defeated in the House of Lords. Nicklinson's death is likely to reignite the debate about assisted suicide. His courage in fighting for his right to die has inspired many people, and his legacy is likely to be a change in the law. In addition to Lord Joffe's comments, other prominent figures have also called for a change in the law. Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: ""Tony Nicklinson's death is a reminder of the urgent need to change the law on assisted dying. ""The current law is cruel and unjust, and it denies people the right to a peaceful and dignified death. ""We urge the government to listen to the public and to introduce legislation that would allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives with medical assistance.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Golden hello' offered to some new GPs in Scotland,"One hundred new GP training places are being advertised, with a £20,000 incentive for some who choose to take up hard to fill posts. Some medical bodies are concerned Scotland is becoming increasingly reliant on overseas doctors, to fill the growing number of vacancies. In some areas in Scotland, almost a third of GPs are from overseas. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the new incentives would help make general practice a more attractive career option and boost recruitment and retention. The new £20,000 ""golden hello"" is being offered to doctors who sign up to work in areas experiencing a shortage of GPs. The funding for the new package has come from the Scottish government's £500m NHS recovery plan. The new GP recruitment drive was launched at Scone Palace in Perth on Thursday. It aims to make general practice a ""more attractive career option"" and boost recruitment and retention. Mr Yousaf said: ""These 100 new GP training places and £20,000 'golden hellos' will help to make general practice a more attractive career option and boost recruitment and retention. ""We know that general practice is the cornerstone of our NHS and these new measures will help to ensure that people across Scotland continue to have access to high quality healthcare, delivered in their communities."" The new GP training places will be available from August 2023. The £20,000 ""golden hello"" will be paid in two instalments - £10,000 after the first year of training and £10,000 after the second year. The total cost of the package is £2m. The Scottish government said it is committed to increasing the number of GPs in Scotland to 5,000 by 2027. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) welcomed the new measures but said more needs to be done to address the underlying problems facing general practice. RCGP Scotland chair Dr Miles Mack said: ""The £20,000 'golden hello' is a welcome step in the right direction, but it is only one part of the solution. We need to see long-term investment in general practice and a commitment to reducing the workload of GPs. Otherwise, we will continue to see GPs leaving the profession and the number of vacancies increasing."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also welcomed the new measures but said they must be part of a wider strategy to address the workforce crisis in the NHS. BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison said: ""The new GP training places and £20,000 'golden hellos' are a positive step, but they must be part of a wider strategy to address the workforce crisis in the NHS. We need to see long-term investment in training and recruitment, and we need to make sure that GPs are supported to deliver high quality care to their patients.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"House prices see biggest monthly fall since 2010, Halifax says","The lender said prices fell by 3.1% between March and April, the biggest decline since September 2010. The bank said that housing demand had softened in the early months of this year, as the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates started to put off potential buyers. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: ""The housing market has started the year with a significant monthly price fall, the first since June 2021 and the largest since the depths of the initial Covid lockdown in 2020. ""While there are signs that buyer demand is moderating, there is still a chronic shortage of available stock on the market. This is likely to continue supporting house prices in the short-term, although the headwinds are growing."" The average house price in the UK is now £278,123, which is £8,691 lower than in March. The annual rate of house price growth has also slowed, from 11.5% in March to 8.4% in April. This is the lowest annual rate of growth since June 2021. The slowdown in house price growth is likely to continue in the coming months, as the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates put off potential buyers. Some experts have predicted that house prices could fall by as much as 10% over the next year. However, others believe that the fall in prices will be more modest, as the lack of supply of homes for sale will continue to support the market. The housing market is a complex one, and there are a number of factors that can affect house prices. These include the economy, interest rates, government policy, and the availability of housing. It is difficult to predict what will happen to house prices in the future, but it is likely that the market will continue to be volatile in the short-term.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scottish women return after stem cell transplants in Russia,"By David Cowan BBC Scotland Jill McLaren and Michele Murray have been living with multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years. They travelled to Moscow for stem cell transplants after initial treatment failed to ease their symptoms. The trips have left both women feeling much better, although it is too early to tell if the stem cells have reversed any of the damage to their immune systems. MS is a neurological condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, difficulty with movement, and problems with vision and speech. There is no cure for MS, but treatments can help to manage the symptoms. In some cases, stem cell transplants can be used to repair the damage to the immune system that causes MS. Jill, 46, from Perth, was diagnosed with MS in 2002. She began experiencing symptoms in 1999, including fatigue, blurred vision, and numbness in her hands and feet. Over the years, her symptoms worsened, and she began to experience problems with her mobility. She was eventually forced to give up her job as a nurse. In 2017, Jill heard about a stem cell transplant clinic in Moscow that was offering treatment for MS. She decided to travel to Russia for the procedure. The transplant involved harvesting stem cells from Jill's own blood and then re-infusing them into her body. The stem cells were then able to travel to the damaged areas of her immune system and repair them. Jill underwent the transplant in 2018, and she has noticed a significant improvement in her symptoms since then. She is now able to walk and move more easily, and she has less pain and fatigue. Michele, 50, from Dundee, was diagnosed with MS in 2003. She began experiencing symptoms in 2000, including fatigue, loss of balance, and problems with her speech. Over the years, her symptoms worsened, and she eventually had to give up her job as a social worker. In 2019, Michele travelled to Moscow for a stem cell transplant. She has also noticed a significant improvement in her symptoms since then. She is now able to walk and move more easily, and she has less pain and fatigue. Both Jill and Michele are hopeful that the stem cell transplants will continue to improve their symptoms and that they will eventually be able to live full and active lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Gunman's parents 'raced to stop him',"They raced to Isla Vista but heard radio reports on the shootings as they drove, friend Simon Astaire told US media. Elliot Rodger, 22, warned of his intentions in his emailed manifesto and a YouTube video posted the day before. Arriving in town, they found streets cordoned off and police on every corner. ""We didn't know where he was or what state he might be in,"" Peter Rodger said. ""We were desperately phoning him, texting him - trying to help him work through it."" Reports suggest he then went on a spree, killing six people and injuring 13. He was finally cornered by police outside an apartment block and shot dead during a car chase. Hours before the attack, Elliot Rodger sent an email to friends and relatives containing a 141-page ""manifesto"" and a link to a video uploaded on YouTube. The document was full of misogynistic rants and detailed plans to murder women and others he saw as enemies. The video showed the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) psychology major sitting in his car, driving around Isla Vista. ""I will punish all of you for it,"" he said in the video, describing how he planned to ""slaughter"" sorority girls and other women who had rejected him. ""I'm angry at all of you,"" he added. ""You have never accepted me, and you have taken away my purpose in life."" In the manifesto, Rodger said he had been planning the attack for the past two years and had acquired three handguns legally. He also detailed how he had been rejected by women and was angry at being treated as an ""inferior"" because he was Asian. ""I have been laughed at, mocked, humiliated, and scorned,"" he wrote. ""I have been treated like a subhuman by the beautiful popular girls that I have desired all my life."" Rodger's classmates described him as a quiet, loner who was often seen around campus. One student, David Wang, told CNN that Rodger had been a member of the school's tennis team but had been kicked off after making threats to the coach. Another student, Eric Chen, said Rodger had been ""kind of weird"" but had never seemed violent. ""He was just a quiet guy,"" Chen said.

The psychological secrets to successful resolutions,"Unfortunately, quite a few fail. But there are some psychological tactics which can be employed to increase the chances of success. 1. Persistence Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, author of 59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot, says: ""Successful people are persistent. They don't give up if they don't see results immediately."" So, if you don't achieve your goal straight away, don't despair. Just keep at it and you'll eventually get there. 2. Small steps Don't try to do too much at once. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will make it seem less daunting and more achievable. ""If your goal is to lose weight, don't try to lose 20kg in a month,"" says Wiseman. ""Start with a more realistic goal, like losing 2kg in a month. Once you've achieved that, you can set a new goal."" 3. Positive self-talk The way you talk to yourself can have a big impact on your success. If you keep telling yourself that you can't do something, you're more likely to give up. Instead, try to be positive and encouraging. Tell yourself that you can do it, and that you're going to achieve your goal. ""Self-talk can be a powerful tool for motivation,"" says Wiseman. ""Positive self-talk can help you to stay focused and determined, even when things get tough."" 4. Accountability Tell someone else about your goal. This could be a friend, family member, or colleague. Having someone to hold you accountable can help you to stay on track. ""When you're accountable to someone else, you're more likely to follow through on your commitment,"" says Wiseman. 5. Reward yourself When you achieve a milestone, reward yourself. This will help you to stay motivated and make the process more enjoyable. ""Rewards can be anything that you enjoy, such as buying yourself something nice, going out for a meal, or spending time with friends,"" says Wiseman. ""Just make sure that the reward is something that you'll really enjoy, so that you're motivated to work towards it."" By following these psychological tactics, you can increase your chances of success and achieve your goals. So what are you waiting for? Get started today!",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""A year on from when this awful virus reached our shores, my thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one or who continues to battle the effects of long Covid,"" he said. ""Having a memorial would provide a permanent space to remember the lives that have been lost to this virus and would also provide a place of reflection for those left behind."" Stormont's health committee chair Colm Gildernew said he would support the idea of a memorial. ""The Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on our communities, taking lives and leaving many others with life-changing long Covid symptoms,"" he said. ""It is important that we have a permanent memorial to remember those who have lost their lives and to honour the sacrifices that have been made by our health and social care workers.""

"Somerset badger cull fails to meet target, Defra admits","The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone – 1,177 badgers, according to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But it failed to meet its target of at least a 70% reduction. Between 2013 and 2017, government-led badger culls took place across four areas of England with the aim of reducing the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Since the culling licenses were last renewed in 2018, the cull areas have been reduced and the Gloucestershire cull zone was closed in 2021. Two cull zones remain in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire, despite ongoing legal challenges and opposition from animal welfare groups. Defra said it was ""disappointed"" the target was not met, but said the 65% reduction did represent ""good progress"". The department said: ""Badger numbers are estimated to be significantly higher than in 2013, so although the 70% cull target was not achieved, the number of badgers removed in the last five years represents a substantial reduction in the badger population in both cull areas."" The Badger Trust, which has long campaigned against the cull, said the results showed it was ""inhumane, ineffective and unscientific"". Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: ""After five years and six weeks of badger killing, Defra has failed even to achieve its own arbitrary cull target. ""Defra have blamed 'bad weather' for the fact they killed fewer badgers than they set out to do. What a pathetic excuse. If cold and wet weather can scupper a multi-million-pound cull of badgers, what a terrible indictment of the operation."" The RSPCA also condemned the cull, saying it was ""cruel and unnecessary"". David Bowles, the RSPCA's head of public affairs, said: ""We continue to believe that the badger cull is a cruel and unnecessary way of managing the spread of TB in cattle. ""There is no scientific evidence to prove that badger culling is effective in reducing TB in cattle, and there are more humane and effective ways of controlling the disease."" The government has said it will review the results of the cull before making a decision on whether to continue with it. A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are considering the results of the badger cull and will make a decision on future policy in due course.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
David Cameron backs Maria Miller as expenses inquiry launched,"The prime minister said his culture secretary had ""excellent answers"" to questions about her expenses claims. Labour MP John Mann submitted a complaint about her claims on Tuesday. It follows reports she had allowed a taxpayer-funded nanny to work on her party political activities. Downing Street said Cameron remained ""fully supportive"" of Miller (pictured) after receiving a letter from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) on Wednesday. Ipsa has launched an inquiry into Miller's expenses and requested documents from her office. The complaint centre on the employment of a full-time nanny. The BBC understands the nanny cared for Miller's young child while her husband was living at the family home. Miller's expenses claims have caused controversy since they were first reported by the Daily Telegraph in 2012. The newspaper alleged Miller claimed for mortgage interest payments on a buy-to-let property she owned despite not living in it. Miller was accused of abusing the ""second homes"" allowance, which was intended to help MPs with the cost of maintaining a second home in London. The MP for Basingstoke claimed £90,000 over a five-year period through the arrangement. In 2013, the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ordered Miller to repay £45,000 of the £90,000 she had claimed. A spokesman for Miller said she had ""always followed the rules and acted in the best interests of taxpayers"". The spokesman added: ""She welcomes the Ipsa inquiry and will co-operate fully."" The inquiry is likely to take several months. The report will conclude whether Miller broke the rules and, if so, what sanction she should face. The expenses scandal has damaged public trust in politicians. It has also led to the creation of new rules governing MPs' expenses. The Ipsa inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into MPs' expenses. In 2010, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up to oversee MPs' expenses. Ipsa has since introduced new rules governing MPs' expenses. The new rules are designed to make the system more transparent and accountable.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Kincora should be part of UK inquiry into child abuse says Amnesty,"The announcement of a new inquiry into the governmental handling of historic child abuse claims brings the issue of Kincora boys' home back into the spotlight. Amnesty International has called for the notorious institution to be included in the probe, citing concerns that it formed part of a wider pattern of abuse that was allegedly covered up by authorities. The Kincora scandal erupted in the 1980s when it was revealed that boys at the Belfast home had been subjected to horrific sexual abuse by staff members. The case sent shockwaves through Northern Ireland and beyond, leading to the resignation of several government ministers and the establishment of a public inquiry. However, Amnesty International has raised concerns that the public inquiry, known as the Historic Abuse Inquiry, did not fully examine the systemic failures that allowed the abuse to take place. The group is particularly interested in exploring the potential links between Kincora and other institutions where child abuse was allegedly covered up. ""There are serious concerns that Kincora was not an isolated case, but part of a wider pattern of abuse that was facilitated by a culture of secrecy and impunity,"" said Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland programme director. ""This new inquiry must leave no stone unturned in examining the full extent of these allegations."" The Home Secretary's announcement of a new inquiry has been welcomed by victims' groups and campaigners. However, there are concerns that the inquiry may be too narrow in scope. The terms of reference for the inquiry are yet to be published, but it is understood that it will focus on how the government handled allegations of child abuse within its own institutions. Amnesty International is calling for the inquiry to be expanded to include wider institutional failures, such as those that occurred at Kincora. The group also wants the inquiry to examine the role of the security services in the alleged cover-up of child abuse. ""It is essential that this inquiry is independent, thorough, and transparent,"" said Corrigan. ""The victims of child abuse deserve nothing less."" The Kincora scandal is a dark chapter in Northern Ireland's history. The new inquiry provides an opportunity to shine a light on the full extent of the abuse that took place and to ensure that those responsible are held to account.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scrap metal laws to be tightened to tackle theft,"Home Secretary Theresa May announced the proposed new laws in a written statement to MPs. The measures will end the current ""low-risk transactions"" for scrap metal dealers, as they will now be required to get a licence to trade. They will also have to carry out checks on customers' identities and record details of all transactions. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to £5,000 or a prison sentence of up to two years. The new laws are part of a wider crackdown on metal theft, which has seen a sharp increase in recent years. In 2013, there were an estimated 56,000 incidents of metal theft in England and Wales, with a total value of £77m. Much of the stolen metal is sold to scrap dealers, who often pay cash and ask no questions about where it came from. The new laws are designed to make it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen metal, and to encourage scrap dealers to be more vigilant about the sources of the metal they purchase. They will also make it easier for the police to track down stolen metal and prosecute those responsible for its theft. The new laws have been welcomed by the scrap metal industry, which has long argued for tougher action to tackle metal theft. The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) said that the new laws ""will help to create a level playing field for all scrap metal dealers and will make it more difficult for criminals to operate."" However, some concerns have been raised about the impact of the new laws on legitimate scrap metal dealers. The BMRA has warned that the new regulations could increase the cost of doing business for scrap metal dealers, and could lead to some legitimate businesses closing down. The government has said that it will work with the scrap metal industry to ensure that the new laws do not have a negative impact on legitimate businesses. It has also said that it will provide funding to help scrap metal dealers comply with the new regulations. The new laws are due to come into force in 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nintendo forecasts loss amid weak Wii U sales,"It now expects to make an operating loss of 35bn yen ($335m; £205m) for the financial year ending 31 March 2014. Its initial estimate in April had been for a 100bn yen profit. Nintendo said sales of its Wii U console - launched in November 2012 - have ""fallen short"". It sold 2.72 million units globally in the nine months to 31 December, short of its target of three million. In a statement, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said: ""As sales of the Wii U have fallen short of our expectations, our overall financial results have also fallen short."" He added: ""We are currently working to increase the sales of our Wii U hardware and software as soon as possible."" Nintendo has already cut the price of the Wii U twice since its launch and has also announced plans to release a range of new games for the console. However, analysts have said that it will be difficult for Nintendo to turn around the fortunes of the Wii U, which has been outsold by rival consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Wii U is Nintendo's first console to use a tablet-style controller. It has been praised for its innovative design, but has struggled to attract a wide audience. Some analysts believe that Nintendo has failed to market the console effectively, while others have said that the Wii U's games library is too small. Despite the Wii U's disappointing sales, Nintendo remains one of the most successful video game companies in the world.

Sabarimala temple: Indian women form '620km human chain' for equality,"The Sabarimala shrine was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. India's top court overturned the ban in September, but conservative groups have protested the decision. As a mark of resistance, hundreds of women participated in a 620km human chain on January 1, 2019. The chain extended from the northern city of Kasaragod to the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, passing through several towns and villages. Women of all ages and backgrounds joined the chain, which was organised by the Kerala Women's Wall collective. Many of the women carried placards demanding equality and respect for women. The event was largely peaceful, but there were some reports of violence. In one incident, a group of men attacked a woman who was participating in the chain. Despite the challenges, the women's wall was seen as a major success. It sent a strong message of unity and solidarity, and it demonstrated the growing demand for gender equality in India. The Sabarimala temple issue has been a flashpoint for debate about gender equality in India. Conservative groups have argued that the ban on women is necessary to protect the ""purity"" of the temple. However, many women's rights activists have condemned the ban as discriminatory and unjust. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the ban was a significant victory for women's rights in India. However, the ongoing protests by conservative groups show that the fight for gender equality is far from over. In the wake of the women's wall, the Kerala government has announced that it will provide security for women who want to visit the Sabarimala temple. The government has also said that it will not tolerate any violence against women who are trying to enter the temple. These are positive steps, but it is important to remember that the fight for gender equality in India is an ongoing one. There are still many laws and practices that discriminate against women in India. The women's wall was a powerful symbol of resistance against these discriminatory practices. It showed that women in India are increasingly determined to fight for their rights.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dumfries and Galloway Council made £6.9m waste deal payment,"The figure emerged after a BBC Freedom of Information request about the financial impact of ending the contract on the Dumfries and Galloway authority. Company accounts of Shanks show that in the year to the end of March 2018, it billed the council £2.6m for the disposal of municipal waste and £2m for landfill tax - a total of £4.6m. In addition, the council paid the firm £1m in ""early termination payments"" after the two-year contract ended in May 2018 and a further £1.3m in ""residual waste treatment costs"" over the next six months. The £6.9m package paid to Shanks led to opposition councillors claiming the authority was ""paying over the odds"" to terminate the contract. And it has also emerged that when the council ended the contract it was still contractually obliged to pay Shanks the £2m annual landfill tax until 2023. The authority secured a loan from the Scottish Government in order to settle the £6.9m bill, which will be paid back over a number of years. A spokesman for the council said: ""The early termination payment was to cover the costs that Shanks had incurred in setting up the contract, and the residual waste treatment costs represented the cost of having waste treated at other facilities."" He added that the council had ""no option"" but to end the waste contract as it was ""not sustainable"". ""The council is now working with other local authorities to explore options for waste disposal in the region,"" he said. Shanks declined to comment. The council's waste bill has been the subject of much debate and scrutiny in recent years. In 2017, it emerged that the authority had paid out £1.4m in compensation to Shanks after a dispute over the quality of recycled materials. And last year, it was revealed that the council was paying £3.7m a year to store waste on a site near Gretna. The Scottish Conservatives have accused the Scottish Government of ""failing"" the people of Dumfries and Galloway by allowing waste costs to spiral out of control. Tory MSP Oliver Mundell said: ""The SNP has presided over a shambles in waste disposal in Dumfries and Galloway, which has led to spiralling costs for taxpayers. ""The people of Dumfries and Galloway are paying the price for the SNP's incompetence."" In a statement, a Scottish Government spokesman said: ""We are aware of the financial challenges faced by Dumfries and Galloway Council in relation to waste management and we are working with the council to explore options to support them in delivering better value for money services.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Slow progress' on child abuse claims in Pembrokeshire,"A follow-up report says improvements have been made in child safeguarding. But management of allegations against Pembrokeshire council professionals remains ""inconsistent"". The council is one of 20 in the UK subject to extra scrutiny over how they handle child abuse claims. Inspectors found ""significant and sustained"" improvements have been made since a previous visit in 2019. But, they said: ""Progress in progressing and resolving individual allegations remains slow."" Inspectors said this was partly caused by the council's managers having ""inconsistent"" approaches to dealing with complaints. However, they praised the council's staff for their ""strong commitment"" to protecting children. Inspectors found a ""significant increase"" in the number of child protection cases investigated by the council's social workers. There were 803 investigations in the year to March 2022, compared with 486 in 2018-19. The number of cases where children were subject to a child protection plan has also increased, from 173 in 2018-19 to 203 in 2021-22. Inspectors welcomed the increase, saying it showed the council was taking a ""more proactive approach"" to child protection. However, they said the council needed to improve the quality of its assessments and plans. Inspectors said the council had made ""significant progress"" in improving its record-keeping. However, they said the council still needed to do more to ensure all records were kept up to date and easily accessible. Overall, inspectors said the council was making ""progress"" in improving its child protection services. However, they said there was still room for improvement, particularly in relation to the management of allegations against council professionals. A Pembrokeshire Council spokesperson said: ""We welcome the recognition of the significant progress that our social care workforce has made in safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and their families. ""We are committed to providing a comprehensive and robust child protection service that places children at the heart of everything we do.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Luton Borough Council proposes cuts to plug £22m shortfall,"Luton Borough Council said its income from Luton Airport ""has all but dried up"". It faced a £50m shortfall and needed to save nearly £22m. Without ""adequate emergency funding"" the authority ""will be forced to implement extreme savings"", it said. The airport, which is owned by the council and operated by London Luton Airport Operations, has been closed since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The council said it was working with the airport to ""explore options"", but warned that ""significant redundancies"" could be necessary. The council's leader, Kevin Chapman, said: ""The impact of the pandemic on Luton Airport has been catastrophic. We are facing a £50m shortfall in our income and we have to save nearly £22m. ""We have been working with the airport to explore options, but we are now at the point where we have to consider implementing extreme savings.

Chapman said: ""We are doing everything we can to support our residents and businesses during this difficult time, but we need the government to provide us with adequate emergency funding. ""Without this funding, we will be forced to implement extreme savings, which will have a devastating impact on our services and the lives of our residents."" The government has provided local authorities with £3.2bn to help them cope with the financial impact of the pandemic, but Luton Borough Council says this is not enough.

Ken Watson, managing director of Sydney Seaplanes, the company that operated the flight, said the turn was ""inexplicable"". ""We don't know why the pilot made such a sharp turn at low altitude,"" he told the BBC. ""It's something that we're trying to understand.""

Demi Lovato fans organise 'get well soon' singalong,"But rather than getting angry, the fans who'd arrived at the venue got together to send a message to the singer, who'd taken ill earlier in the day. Gathering at the O2's Blueroom Cafe, they began singing a rendition of Lovato's song Warrior. Videos on social media show dozens of fans standing arm-in-arm, arms aloft, singing the lyrics directly into their camera phones. ""Now I'm a warrior/Now I got thicker skin/I'm a warrior/I'm stronger than I've ever been,"" they sang. The song has long been a favourite among Lovato's fans, who identify with its message of overcoming adversity. Lovato herself tweeted that she was ""blown away"" by the fan support. ""I am so grateful for all of your love and support,"" she wrote. ""Thank you for making me feel so loved."" The singalong wasn't the only way Lovato's fans showed their support. Many took to social media to share messages of love and encouragement. One fan wrote: ""Demi, you are a warrior and you will get through this. We are all here for you."" Another wrote: ""Demi, your music has helped me through so much. Thank you for sharing your story with the world."" Lovato's illness is the latest in a series of health struggles she has faced in recent years. In 2018, she was hospitalised for an apparent drug overdose.

Coastguard rescues suspected migrants off Kent coast,"The BBC has been told some of the passengers phoned relatives in Calais to say they were in trouble after their boat started taking in water. HM Coastguard said it started receiving multiple 999 calls at about 18:30 BST on Thursday. Two RNLI lifeboats, Dover lifeboat and two French patrol vessels were sent to the scene. One person was airlifted to hospital but their condition is not yet known. The remaining 30 on board the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) were described as ""cold and wet"" when they were brought back to Dover. Dover RNLI coxswain Mark Jackson said: ""It was a very rough night with a large swell and Force 6 winds so the sea conditions were challenging for both the passengers and the rescue teams. ""It's believed the vessel had been at sea for some considerable time before we reached it. ""All of the people were quickly moved to the shelter of the lifeboat and given blankets and hot drinks to warm them up."" French officials say they are stepping up efforts to tackle Channel crossings, which they blame on organised crime gangs. The government has been criticised by opposition politicians for its handling of the numbers of migrants arriving in the UK from France. More than 4,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year, a figure that is already higher than the total for the whole of last year. In April, the government announced a plan to send migrants who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda. The policy has been condemned by refugee charities and human rights groups, and is currently being challenged in the courts.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Warning of challenges for UK oil sector from Wood Group,"Bob Keiller warned that the second half of the North Sea story is going to be different from the first. He was speaking ahead of the Offshore Europe exhibition and conference in Aberdeen. Mr Keiller said the industry was at a ""critical juncture"" as the world transitioned to net zero and countries looked to reduce their reliance on hydrocarbons. ""We're going to have to find ways to do things which we haven't done before,"" he said. ""We're going to have to work more collaboratively, more efficiently, and we're going to have to be more innovative."" Mr Keiller said the industry needed to focus on three key areas: Improving recovery rates: The UK currently recovers around 40% of the oil and gas from its North Sea fields. Mr Keiller said this could be increased to 50% or even 60% by using new technologies. Developing new technologies: The industry needs to invest in new technologies that can help to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This includes technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation. Collaboration: The industry needs to work more closely together to share ideas and expertise. This includes working with companies in other sectors, such as the renewable energy sector. Mr Keiller said the industry needed to ""change the narrative"" around the North Sea. ""We need to show that the North Sea is still a vital part of the UK's energy mix,"" he said. ""And we need to show that the industry is committed to investing in the future."" The Offshore Europe exhibition and conference is one of the world's leading events for the offshore energy industry. It takes place in Aberdeen every two years and attracts over 35,000 visitors. The event is a showcase for the latest technologies and innovations in the offshore energy sector.

The government has said that academies are more autonomous than council-run schools and are therefore able to ""innovate and improve more quickly."" However, critics have argued that academies can be less accountable to parents and the local community. The letter from Michael Gove comes after the council rejected a proposal to turn Bexhill High School into an academy. The school is currently run by the council.

The consequences of a busy day,"Nick Triggle Health correspondent The day before Liverpool had won the Carling Cup football final, while the Sun on Sunday had just been launched. For the NHS, it was just another manic Monday. The emergency department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital was packed. It was the busiest day of the year so far, with more than 400 patients passing through its doors. Dr Rebecca Jones, the department's clinical director, said it was a ""perfect storm"" of factors that had led to the surge in demand. ""We had a lot of people coming in with injuries from the football match, as well as people who had been drinking too much and had fallen over,"" she said. ""We also had a lot of patients with respiratory problems, which is common at this time of year. It all added up to a very busy day."" The Royal Liverpool Hospital is not alone. Emergency departments across the country are reporting similar levels of demand. A recent survey by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that more than half of emergency departments are seeing more patients than they can safely accommodate. The college's president, Dr Taj Hassan, said the NHS was facing a ""crisis"" and called for urgent action to address the problem. ""We are seeing more and more patients coming through our doors, but we are not getting the resources we need to meet demand,"" he said. ""This is putting patients at risk and it is also putting staff under a lot of pressure."" The government has said it is committed to investing in the NHS, but the college says more needs to be done. It is calling for an increase in funding for emergency departments, as well as more staff and more beds. The college is also calling for a review of the way emergency services are provided. It says the current system is too fragmented and does not provide patients with the best possible care. The government has said it is considering the college's proposals, but it is not clear when any changes will be made. In the meantime, emergency departments across the country are continuing to struggle to cope with demand. Dr Jones said the staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital were doing their best to provide the best possible care for their patients, but they were under a lot of pressure.

UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle,"UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle By Laurence Peter BBC News The UK's ruling Conservatives clashed with European judges over a UK ban on prisoners voting. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in 2005 that a blanket ban on prisoners voting was a breach of human rights. However, the UK government has refused to implement the ruling, arguing that it is a matter of national security. In recent months, there have been signs that the government is softening its stance. In March, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""open-minded"" about the possibility of allowing some prisoners to vote. And in June, the government published a consultation paper on the issue. The consultation paper set out two options for reform. The first option would allow prisoners serving sentences of less than four years to vote. The second option would allow all prisoners to vote, except those convicted of serious violent or sexual offences. The consultation closed in September, and the government is now considering the responses. It is expected to announce its decision in the coming months. Some Conservative MPs have expressed concerns about the government's plans. They argue that allowing prisoners to vote would be a betrayal of victims of crime. However, other Conservatives have welcomed the government's move. They argue that it is important to uphold the rule of law and that prisoners should not be denied their basic rights. The issue of prisoner voting is a complex and controversial one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate. Ultimately, it will be up to the government to decide whether or not to change the law. Update: 12 October 2022 The government has now announced its decision on prisoner voting. It has decided to adopt the first option set out in the consultation paper, which will allow prisoners serving sentences of less than four years to vote. The decision has been welcomed by some Conservative MPs, who argue that it is a sensible compromise that will uphold the rule of law while also respecting the rights of prisoners. However, other Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment, arguing that it is a betrayal of victims of crime. The decision is likely to be challenged in the courts. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the government's blanket ban on prisoners voting was unlawful. However, the government argues that the new law is compliant with the Supreme Court's ruling. The issue of prisoner voting is likely to continue to be a source of debate and controversy for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of wife's murder,"Mitesh Patel, 37, denied killing Jessica, 34, and staging a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough. Teesside Crown Court heard he had planned the murder for months, buying chloroform, tape, gloves, and a stun gun. He also created a fake Grindr profile to lure men to the house while Jessica was out. On May 14, 2020, Patel lured victim Anthony Armstrong to the house and attacked him with the stun gun. He then strangled Jessica and staged a burglary to cover up the crime. Armstrong survived the attack and later identified Patel as his attacker. The court heard that Patel was in financial trouble and had been having an affair with a man he met on Grindr. He had also been taking steroids and had a history of domestic violence. The jury heard that Patel had sent a series of text messages to his lover in the weeks leading up to the murder, discussing his plans to kill his wife. In one message, he said: ""I'm going to do it. I'm going to kill her."" Patel was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. The judge said that he had shown ""no remorse"" for his crime and that he was a ""dangerous and manipulative"" individual. The case has shocked the community of Middlesbrough. Jessica's family said they were ""devastated"" by her death and that they could not believe that Patel had killed her. The case has also raised concerns about the safety of Grindr users.

The team said: ""The group had intended on completing the Ben Nevis Horseshoe but soon lost their way after bad weather closed in. They then tried to descend via Carn Mor Dearg but became disoriented in the worsening conditions. The onset of darkness further complicated matters and the group found themselves stranded on steep ground, having become separated.

Stormont deadlock: Sinn Féin to meet Leo Varadkar,"Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said she will tell the British and Irish governments this week that ""direct rule from London is not an option"". McDonald will meet Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on Wednesday in a bid to break the Stormont deadlock. The meeting comes after the UK government announced plans to introduce legislation that would allow it to unilaterally set a budget for Northern Ireland in the absence of a functioning devolved government. The move has been met with anger by Sinn Féin, which has accused the UK government of ""bullying"" and ""bad faith"". McDonald said she would use her meetings with Varadkar and Heaton-Harris to set out Sinn Féin's position and to ""explore any and all possibilities"" for restoring power-sharing. ""I will be making it very clear to both governments that we will not accept any attempt to impose Tory cuts and austerity on the people of the north by the back door,"" she said. ""Direct rule from London is not an option, and we will not allow it to happen. ""The people of the north have a right to have their say in how they are governed, and that right must be respected."" The Stormont Assembly has been in deadlock since May 2022 after the DUP withdrew from the power-sharing Executive in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK government has said it is prepared to call fresh elections for the Assembly if a new Executive is not formed by the end of October. However, Sinn Féin has said it will not participate in any elections until the UK government agrees to implement the Protocol in full. The Protocol is a part of the Brexit deal that was designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, the DUP has argued that the Protocol has created a trade barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and has damaged the region's economy. The UK government has said it is willing to make changes to the Protocol, but only if the EU agrees. The EU has said it is willing to discuss changes to the Protocol, but only if they do not undermine the integrity of the single market. The Stormont deadlock has left Northern Ireland without a functioning government for over a year. This has led to a number of problems, including a lack of progress on key issues such as health, education, and infrastructure. The deadlock has also damaged Northern Ireland's reputation as a place to do business.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Rower, 72, set to become oldest to cross Atlantic","Graham Walters, from Thurmaston in Leicestershire, is raising money for Help for Heroes by rowing from Gran Canaria to Antigua. This is his fifth and arguably most challenging ocean rowing attempt. If successful, at 72 years old, he will become the oldest person to row solo, unsupported, across the Atlantic Ocean. Graham retired from his job as a financial adviser in 2016 and within a year he was attempting a record-breaking row across the Atlantic Ocean. However, due to a series of injuries and adverse weather conditions, he had to abandon his attempt. Undeterred, in 2018, he set a new Guinness World Record by becoming the oldest person to row solo, unsupported, across the Indian Ocean from Australia to Mauritius. In March 2020, just days before he was due to set off on his second attempt to row the Atlantic, the Covid-19 pandemic forced him to postpone. But on 12 December 2022, Graham finally set off on his Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, a 3,000-mile solo row from Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, to Antigua in the Caribbean. Graham's boat is a Rannoch R45 ocean rowing boat, which is just 23ft long and weighs just 450kg. He will be carrying all of his food, water, and equipment, weighing an additional 200kg. He will be rowing non-stop 24 hours a day. He will be getting food and sleep in short naps, typically in 20-minute bursts. Graham is aiming to raise £100,000 for Help for Heroes, a charity that supports members of the armed forces who have been wounded or injured in the line of duty. He said: ""I'm doing this to raise money for Help for Heroes, a charity that is very close to my heart. I have been supporting them for many years, and I know what a difference they make to the lives of our wounded servicemen and women.

Seychelles protects an area 'as big as Britain' in Indian Ocean,"In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off, the island nation has agreed to protect 210,000 sq km (81,000 sq miles) of ocean. The reserves will ban commercial fishing, oil and gas exploration, and mining. The Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, with a total land area of just 455 sq km (176 sq miles). The new marine protected areas (MPAs) will be more than 400 times larger than the country's landmass. The Seychelles is home to a rich diversity of marine life, including coral reefs, sea turtles, sharks, and rays. The new MPAs will help to protect these species and their habitats from overfishing and other threats. The debt-for-nature swap was arranged by The Nature Conservancy, a US-based environmental organization. The Seychelles government will receive $21 million to pay off its debt, and The Nature Conservancy will provide technical assistance to help the government manage the new MPAs. The debt-for-nature swap is a win-win for the Seychelles and for the environment. The Seychelles will get some of its debt paid off, and the new MPAs will help to protect the country's marine resources. The Seychelles is not the first country to use a debt-for-nature swap to protect its environment. In 2016, Belize agreed to protect 30% of its territorial waters in exchange for getting $586 million of its debt paid off. Debt-for-nature swaps are a creative way to finance conservation efforts. They can help countries to protect their environment while also reducing their debt burden. The Seychelles' new MPAs are a significant step forward in the fight to protect the world's oceans. They will help to ensure that future generations can enjoy the beauty and bounty of the Seychelles' marine environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Rise in ambulance delays at South East hospitals,"South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) figures show ambulances had 36,000 hours ""handover time"" in 2011/12, 50% more than three years ago. The service says it's ""very concerned"" by the trend. Ambulances waiting to handover patients to A&E staff have more than doubled in some areas of Kent over the period, analysts found. In November 2012, SECAmb reported delays of more than an hour at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford on 115 occasions, compared to just five the same month in 2011. Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham reported 104 hour-long delays, and Maidstone Hospital had 23. SECAmb boss Paul Sutton said it was a ""national problem"". He told BBC South East Today: ""It's not just about putting more ambulances on the road. It's about the whole system."" SECAmb said delays occur when ambulances are stuck outside A&E departments waiting to hand over patients to hospital staff. The handover process can take several hours, and during that time the ambulance crew is unavailable to respond to other calls. SECAmb said the increase in handover time was putting a strain on its resources. The service said it was working with hospitals to find ways to reduce handover delays but admitted it was a ""complex"" issue with no easy solutions. The BBC understands that delays are being caused by a number of factors, including the increasing number of elderly and frail patients who need more time to be assessed and admitted to hospital. Another factor is the number of patients who are staying in hospital for longer periods of time, which means there are fewer beds available for new admissions. The delays are also being caused by a shortage of nurses in A&E departments, which means that patients are waiting longer to be seen by a doctor. SECAmb said it was working with hospitals to find ways to reduce handover delays but admitted it was a ""complex"" issue with no easy solutions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina resigns,"Prosecutors accuse Mr Perez Molina of masterminding a scheme to defraud the customs service of millions of dollars. He denies the allegations. On Tuesday, Congress stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, paving the way for him to be arrested and charged. Mr Perez Molina, a retired general, becomes the latest in a string of Latin American presidents to be embroiled in corruption scandals. His resignation comes amid growing public anger over corruption and impunity in Guatemala. The scandal, known as ""La Linea"" (The Line), is alleged to have involved a network of officials and businesspeople who charged importers bribes in exchange for reducing their customs duties. The scheme is said to have operated for several years, netting millions of dollars. Mr Perez Molina has denied any involvement in the scandal, but several of his close associates have been arrested, including his former vice-president, Roxana Baldetti. The resignation of Mr Perez Molina is a major victory for the anti-corruption movement in Guatemala. It is also a sign that the region's leaders are becoming increasingly vulnerable to prosecution for corruption. In recent years, several other Latin American presidents have been accused of corruption, including Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina, and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela. Some of these leaders have been impeached or removed from office, while others are still facing charges. The corruption scandals in Latin America have led to widespread public anger and protests. Citizens are demanding greater transparency and accountability from their governments. The resignation of Mr Perez Molina is a sign that these demands are being heard. It is too early to say whether Mr Perez Molina's resignation will lead to lasting change in Guatemala. However, it is a clear sign that the country's citizens are no longer willing to tolerate corruption and impunity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore',"Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: ""I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing."" Boeing is fighting for its reputation and survival after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max jet. The company has been accused of putting profits before safety, and its relationship with the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has come under scrutiny. In the wake of the crashes, Boeing has made changes to the design of the 737 Max and its safety protocols. However, some experts believe that the company's problems go beyond the technical issues with the aircraft. ""Boeing has a culture problem,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group. ""They have been focused on cost-cutting and shareholder returns, and they have lost sight of their core mission of safety."" Boeing has admitted that it made mistakes in the design and certification of the 737 Max. The company has also agreed to pay billions of dollars in compensation to the families of the victims of the crashes. However, some experts believe that Boeing's problems are more deep-rooted. They argue that the company has lost its way and that it needs to undergo a fundamental change in its culture. ""Boeing needs to go back to its roots,"" said Aboulafia. ""They need to focus on building safe, reliable aircraft, and they need to put the interests of their customers first."" Boeing's future is uncertain. The company is facing a number of legal challenges, and its reputation has been badly damaged. However, Boeing is a resilient company with a long history of innovation. It remains to be seen whether Boeing can overcome its current challenges and regain the trust of its customers. In the meantime, Ms Kuria's comments are a reminder of the importance of trust in the aviation industry. Passengers need to be able to trust that the aircraft they are flying on are safe. Boeing has a lot of work to do to rebuild that trust.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Peter Sutcliffe victim highlights 'imbalance of justice' for women,"Mo Lea, 61, from Bedford, was an art student in Leeds in 1980 when she was attacked by a man with a hammer. She has been named as one of the likely victims of Sutcliffe, but despite suffering life-changing injuries including a fractured skull, permanent sight loss in one eye and severe brain damage, Sutcliffe was never charged with her attempted murder. ""I think about him every day,"" Mo told the BBC. ""The fact he is dead doesn't make life any easier. I don't feel any closure. I am still living with the consequences of what he did to me."" Mo's story is one of many that highlights the historical imbalance of justice for women who were victims of serious sexual and violent crime. In Sutcliffe's case, his victims were predominantly women from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were often sex workers or runaways. This meant that their cases were often treated with less seriousness by police and the justice system, and they were less likely to be believed or taken seriously. ""When you are seen as being of less value by society, you are less likely to get justice,"" said Diane Taylor, chief executive of Leeds Women's Aid. ""It's a sad indictment of our society that women like Mo have to fight for recognition and justice."" In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the historical injustice faced by women victims of violence. This has been partly driven by campaigns by women's rights groups and the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. As a result, there have been some changes in the way that police and the justice system deal with cases of violence against women. For example, there is now a greater focus on victim support and the need to believe and take seriously the experiences of women who report crimes. However, Mo believes that there is still more to be done to address the historical imbalance of justice for women. ""I think it's really important that we don't forget the women who were victims of Peter Sutcliffe and other serial killers,"" she said. ""They deserve to be remembered and their stories need to be told."" Mo also believes that more needs to be done to support women who have been victims of violence and to help them access justice. ""There needs to be more support for women who have suffered serious sexual and violent crime,"" she said. ""They need to be able to access specialist services that can help them to cope with the trauma they have experienced and to get the justice they deserve.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid-19: Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry move into tier 2,"Restrictions came into force at 00:01 BST on Saturday. Slough has also moved into the tier two ""high"" category. The restrictions in tier two mean households can no longer mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants, unless those venues are serving substantial meals. People are also advised against travelling in and out of the affected areas. Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Abi Brown said: ""These restrictions may not be what we wanted to hear, but they are absolutely necessary to protect our residents and communities. We know that the vast majority of people in Stoke-on-Trent have been following the guidance and doing everything they can to stop the spread of the virus."" She added: ""But we cannot be complacent. This is not the time to let our guard down. We must all continue to follow the guidance and do everything we can to protect ourselves and others."" Coventry City Council leader George Duggins said: ""We are very disappointed that Coventry has been placed in tier two. We have been working hard to keep the number of cases down in our city, and we believe that we have been successful in doing so."" He added: ""However, we understand the government's decision and we will be working with them to ensure that the restrictions are implemented effectively. We urge all Coventry residents to follow the guidance and do everything they can to stop the spread of the virus."" The move to tier two comes as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in the UK. On Friday, the government announced that there had been 17,234 new cases of the virus in the UK, the highest daily total since May.

Budget 2020: The chancellor's very large cheque book,"Rishi Sunak has barely been in one of the biggest jobs in the country for a month, but he has already pulled out his biggest weapon - the cheque book. Wednesday's Budget was never going to be a normal one. The new chancellor arrived in Parliament with the weight of Brexit uncertainty lifting, but the looming threat of the coronavirus hanging over everything. So, he used his set-piece speech to set out how he wants the UK to look in the years to come, with big investment in infrastructure, changes to taxation for businesses and a boost to the NHS. It was a budget based on the idea that the government could spend its way out of trouble, without worrying too much about what it might mean for the long-term. But this was also a Budget that was trying to do too much. It wanted to fix the nation's creaky infrastructure, simultaneously invest in the NHS, and then slash taxes for businesses. The result is a plan that looks like it has been cobbled together from the ideas of three or four different chancellors. The green bits - the money for new infrastructure, the support for electric cars - are very much in keeping with the direction of travel of Boris Johnson's government. The bits that focus on public services - the extra doctors, the nurses, the schools - are what you would expect from a Conservative government. And then there are the tax cuts - a classic Thatcherite policy that seemed to catch some of the chancellor's cabinet colleagues off guard. Ultimately, this was a Budget that lacked a coherent narrative. It was an attempt to do too much, and in doing so, risked losing focus. The chancellor used the language of investment and growth, but at the heart of the Budget was an old-fashioned Conservative philosophy - let's give businesses a tax break and they'll pass it on to their workers. That's a gamble. It's also the opposite of the approach taken by the chancellor's predecessor, Sajid Javid, who wanted to use the tax system to create a fairer society. It's a big gamble and it's one that could backfire spectacularly. But then again, Rishi Sunak is a politician who likes to rewrite the rules.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Astronaut Scott Kelly attacked for quoting Winston Churchill,"American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. Kelly, who spent a year on the International Space Station in 2015 and 2016, is a big fan of Churchill and often quotes him on social media. But his recent tweet about Churchill's quote on democracy sparked a backlash, with many accusing him of supporting Churchill's views on race and empire. ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time,"" Kelly tweeted, quoting Churchill. The tweet was quickly met with criticism from people who pointed out that Churchill also believed in the superiority of the white race and supported the British Empire. ""I'm sorry, but I can't support someone who quotes Winston Churchill,"" tweeted one person. ""His views on race and empire were abhorrent."" ""Churchill was a racist and an imperialist,"" tweeted another. ""He has no place in modern society."" Kelly has since deleted the tweet and apologized for any offense he caused. ""I apologize if my tweet caused any offense,"" he tweeted. ""I am a big fan of Churchill's leadership during World War II, but I do not endorse his views on race and empire."" However, some people believe that Kelly should not have apologized for quoting Churchill. ""I think it's important to remember that Churchill was a complex figure,"" said historian Andrew Roberts. ""He was a great leader who also had some very flawed views. We should not judge him by today's standards."" The debate over Churchill's legacy is likely to continue for many years to come. He was a complex figure who made both great and terrible decisions. It is up to each individual to decide how they view him.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
'Shrewsbury 24': MPs vote for release of government papers,"Campaigners want to quash convictions against 24 men who were accused of violent picketing and intimidating workers in Shropshire, in 1972. The men, known as the ""Shrewsbury 24"", were convicted following a 15-week trial and have spent decades campaigning to clear their names. MPs voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to release papers relating to the case, which campaigners say could prove the men's innocence. The motion was passed by 270 votes to 0, with 23 Conservative MPs abstaining. It called on the government to release all ""relevant papers"" relating to the case, including those that are currently withheld on national security grounds. The government has said it is ""carefully considering"" the motion, but has not yet committed to releasing the papers. The Shrewsbury 24 were convicted of conspiracy to intimidate, unlawful assembly, and affray. They were accused of attacking non-striking workers and damaging property during a strike at the Shrewsbury plant of the construction company, GKN Sankey. The men have always maintained their innocence, and their supporters say that the convictions were based on fabricated evidence. In 2018, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. The CCRC said there was ""a real possibility"" that the men's convictions would be quashed. The Court of Appeal is currently considering the case. The release of the government papers could provide crucial evidence in the appeal. The campaigners say that the papers could show that the police and security services fabricated evidence against the men. They also say that the papers could show that the government was involved in a cover-up. The government has said that it is ""committed to transparency"" and that it will release the papers if it is ""appropriate to do so"". However, the government has not yet said when it will make a decision on the matter. The campaigners have welcomed the vote in Parliament, but they say that the government must now act quickly to release the papers. A spokesperson for the Shrewsbury 24 Campaign said: ""This is a historic moment. The vote in Parliament shows that there is overwhelming support for the release of the government papers. ""We now call on the government to act quickly and release the papers in full. The men have waited decades for justice, and they deserve to have their names cleared.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail,"Maplin, which has more than 200 stores and 2,300 staff, will continue to trade through the process. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence, and a withdrawal of credit.

Our immediate priority is to assess the financial position of the business and consider all options available."" Maplin has been hit by the downturn in the consumer electronics market, as well as the rising cost of importing goods from overseas.

Colchester Hospital: Police launch formal inquiry,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said earlier this month Colchester Hospital staff were ""pressured or bullied"" to change data. Essex Police announced on Tuesday it would be investigating. NHS England also revealed details of a review. The inquiry will consider whether staff were pressured to change patient data, the impact this has had on patient care, the extent of the issue within the hospital, and the actions taken to address it. The CQC's report, published on 4 July, found that staff at the hospital had been altering data to meet targets. This included changing the time patients were admitted and discharged, and the length of time they spent in hospital. The report also found that staff were ""pressured or bullied"" to change data by their managers. This was done in order to make the hospital look better in performance tables. The CQC said that the data manipulation had ""a negative impact on patient care"". This was because it meant that patients were not always receiving the correct treatment. The police investigation will now consider whether any criminal offences have been committed. NHS England has also announced that it will be conducting a review of the hospital. This review will look at the extent of the data manipulation and the actions taken to address it. The review will also make recommendations on how to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The hospital has said that it is ""fully cooperating"" with the police and NHS England investigations. It has also said that it is ""committed to providing high-quality care to its patients"". The hospital has been under increasing pressure in recent months. In March, it was placed in special measures by the CQC. This means that it is subject to additional monitoring and support from the CQC. The hospital is also facing financial difficulties. It has a deficit of £11 million and is planning to make cuts to its services. The CQC's report and the police investigation are likely to add to the pressure on the hospital. It is now facing the prospect of criminal charges and further sanctions from the CQC. The hospital is now at a crossroads. It needs to address the serious issues that have been raised by the CQC and the police. It also needs to find a way to improve its financial position. If the hospital can do this, it has the potential to become a good hospital. However, if it fails to address these issues, it is likely to face further decline.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tidal energy project proposed off Bardsey Island,"Local community enterprise YnNi Llyn has teamed up with Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation to explore the possibility of deploying a 3MW tidal energy array off Bardsey Island, north Wales. The project, which would be the first of its kind in Wales, could generate enough electricity to power around 2,000 homes. It would also create jobs and boost the local economy. Tidal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that can be generated from the movement of the tides. Nova Innovation is a world-leading developer of tidal energy technology. The company's turbines are designed to be low-impact and fish-friendly. The proposed tidal energy array would be located in the Bardsey Sound, between Bardsey Island and the Llŷn Peninsula. The site has strong tidal currents and is well-suited for tidal energy generation. YnNi Llyn is a community-owned enterprise that is working to develop renewable energy projects in the Llŷn Peninsula. The company is committed to working with local communities to ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are shared by all. The tidal energy project is still in the early stages of development. However, YnNi Llyn and Nova Innovation are confident that it has the potential to be a major success. ""This project has the potential to transform the way we generate energy in Wales,"" said YnNi Llyn project manager Geraint Jones. ""Tidal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that can help us to reduce our carbon emissions and create jobs."" ""We are delighted to be working with YnNi Llyn on this exciting project,"" said Nova Innovation CEO Simon Forrest. ""We believe that our tidal energy technology can make a significant contribution to the UK's renewable energy targets."" The project has been welcomed by local politicians and environmental groups. ""This project is a great example of how communities can work together to develop renewable energy projects,"" said local MS Sian Gwenlli. ""It has the potential to create jobs, boost the local economy, and reduce our carbon emissions."" ""We are very supportive of this project,"" said Friends of the Earth Cymru campaigner Dewi Williams.

Why India’s mobile users go offline for video,"By Prasanto K Roy Technology writer It sells odds and ends, and DVD discs, each with up to 10 movies of doubtful quality. Asim Mandal, 26, a checkout clerk at a local retailer, is a regular. He pops out his phone's memory card and hands it over to the shop owner. In return, he is handed back a fresh card featuring the latest - and equally dubious - Bollywood blockbusters. ""I have five, six cards at home, Each one has different films on it,"" he says. ""I watch them on my phone when I'm at work, or when I'm travelling."" Mandal is not alone. Many Indians who have low-quality or unreliable internet access prefer to download movies and store them on memory cards so that they can be watched offline later. It is a phenomenon that is particularly common in smaller towns and villages, where data connectivity can be patchy or expensive. ""I don't have a Wi-Fi connection at home, and my mobile data is very slow,"" says 19-year-old college student Soniya Gupta. ""So I download movies onto my phone when I'm at college, and then watch them later."" The trend has been boosted by the rise of cheap smartphones and memory cards. Even low-end phones now have enough storage space to hold several movies, and memory cards are widely available for less than $10. This offline viewing trend is not unique to India. In many developing countries, where internet access is limited or expensive, people often download content to watch later. But in India, the practice is particularly widespread. There are several reasons for this. First, India has a large population of low-income earners who cannot afford to pay for high-speed internet. Second, the country's mobile networks are often congested, making it difficult to stream video smoothly. Third, India has a strong tradition of piracy, and many people are willing to download copyrighted content illegally. The offline viewing trend has had a significant impact on the Indian film industry. In the past, people who lived in rural areas had to wait for months or even years to see the latest Bollywood releases. Now, they can download them within days of their release. This has led to a decline in ticket sales at movie theaters in smaller towns and villages. But it has also created new opportunities for filmmakers. Bollywood producers are now making more low-budget films that are specifically targeted at the offline market. These films are often made with smaller casts and crews, and they feature less-known actors. But they are still able to generate significant profits, thanks to the large number of people who watch them offline. The offline viewing trend is likely to continue to grow in India in the coming years. As more and more people gain access to smartphones and memory cards, they will be able to enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows whenever and wherever they want.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hospital funding issues put local MPs on the spot,"The irony is that the private finance initiative was devised by the previous Conservative administration. But it was Labour who adopted it with a will, as a way of replacing crumbling or outdated hospital buildings. The PFI scheme meant that hospitals were built by private companies, which then leased the buildings back to the NHS. The NHS paid a rent for the buildings over a period of many years, often 30 or 40 years. The intention was to provide new hospitals quickly and without having to make the full cost of the building immediately available. But the PFI scheme has been criticised for being expensive and inflexible. Critics argue that the NHS has been paying too much rent for the buildings, and that the leases have prevented the NHS from making changes it would like to make. In recent years, the government has been moving away from PFI as a way of funding new hospitals. Instead, it has been using a system called the Public Sector Comparator, which is designed to be more transparent and flexible. However, the legacy of PFI continues to haunt the NHS. Many hospitals are still paying rent on PFI-funded buildings, and the contracts can be difficult to break. This is putting pressure on NHS budgets and making it difficult for hospitals to invest in new services and equipment. Local MPs are now being put on the spot by angry constituents who are demanding to know why their local hospitals are struggling for funding. In some cases, MPs are being accused of not doing enough to stand up for their local NHS services. One MP who has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the government's handling of the NHS is Labour's David Winnick. Winnick has accused the government of ""underfunding"" the NHS and of failing to address the problems caused by PFI. He has also called for the government to scrap the PFI scheme and to invest more money in the NHS. The government has defended its record on the NHS, arguing that it has increased funding for the health service in recent years. However, the government has also acknowledged that the NHS is facing financial challenges, and it has said that it is working to address these challenges. The debate over NHS funding is likely to continue in the run-up to the next general election. The NHS is a vital part of the UK's public services, and it is essential that it is properly funded.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scotland's economy grows by 0.1%,"The GDP (gross domestic product) figures for the second quarter were down from the 0.6% growth at the start of 2017. Scotland's first quarter figures were above the equivalent rate for the UK as a whole. The GDP figures are compiled by the Scottish government and measure the value of all goods and services produced in Scotland. They are used to track the performance of the Scottish economy and to compare it to the performance of the UK economy as a whole. The second quarter figures, which cover the period from April to June 2017, showed that the Scottish economy grew by 0.1%. This was down from the 0.6% growth recorded in the first quarter of the year. The UK economy as a whole grew by 0.3% in the second quarter. The slowdown in growth in the second quarter was driven by a number of factors, including a decline in oil and gas production and a slowdown in manufacturing. However, the Scottish economy is still performing better than the UK economy as a whole. Over the past year, the Scottish economy has grown by 1.2%, compared to 1.1% for the UK as a whole. The Scottish government welcomed the latest GDP figures, but said that there was still more to be done to improve the performance of the economy. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""These figures show that the Scottish economy is continuing to grow, but we are not complacent. We are determined to create a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Scotland for everyone."" The UK government also welcomed the latest GDP figures, but said that the figures showed that the UK economy was still facing challenges. A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""These figures show that the UK economy is continuing to grow, but we are not complacent. We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few."" The latest GDP figures have been met with mixed reactions from economists. Some economists have praised the Scottish government for its handling of the economy, while others have said that more needs to be done to improve the performance of the economy.

Michael Gove 'shuddered' at UKIP migrants poster,"The justice secretary joined a number of politicians attacking the poster, featuring a photo taken in Slovenia, with George Osborne saying it had ""echoes"" of 1930s propaganda. Gove said the poster reduced immigration to ""a question of color and ethnicity"" and that UKIP's core message was ""dividing our communities"". ""To try and win support by suggesting that immigration is a threat to the UK is just wrong,"" he added. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, called the poster ""sickening"" and said it was ""trying to divide people"".

The UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, defended the poster, saying it was ""not racist"" and that it was ""not trying to demonize anybody"". He said the poster was about ""highlighting the problems of uncontrolled immigration"" and that it was ""not about race"". The poster has been widely condemned by anti-racism campaigners, who say it is racist and divisive. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said the poster was ""a new low in British politics"" and that it ""demonstrates a frightening disregard for the feelings of minority communities in this country"". The Stop Hate UK campaign group said the poster was ""a blatant attempt to stir up racial hatred"" and that it ""should be condemned by all decent people"".

India PM Narendra Modi warning about religious attacks,"By Sanjoy Majumder BBC News In one instance, a Catholic church was burned down in a suburb of the capital. The violence has upset India's Christian community, which is a small but visible and influential minority. Church leaders have alleged that some of the attacks have been carried out by Hindu nationalist groups. The government denies that it tolerates violence against religious minorities. However, critics say that it has not done enough to protect Christians and other religious minorities from attack. In a speech to mark Christmas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attacks on Christians and said that violence against any religious group was ""unacceptable"". He also appealed for religious harmony and peace. ""Violence against any religion is unacceptable,"" Modi said. ""We must respect every religion and every faith. There is no place for violence in a civilised society."" Modi's speech was welcomed by some Christian leaders, but others said that it did not go far enough. They called on the government to take more concrete steps to protect Christians and other religious minorities from attack. In recent years, there has been a rise in communal violence in India. According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 282 incidents of communal violence in 2020, up from 230 in 2019. The majority of the victims of communal violence are Muslims, but Christians have also been targeted. In 2020, there were 35 incidents of violence against Christians, up from 26 in 2019. The violence has raised concerns about the safety of religious minorities in India. Some Christian leaders have said that they fear that the country is becoming increasingly intolerant. The Indian government has said that it is committed to protecting religious freedom and that it will not tolerate violence against any religious group. However, critics say that the government needs to do more to address the root causes of communal violence and to ensure that all religious minorities feel safe and secure.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pakistan is hit by dengue fever epidemic,"By M Ilyas Khan BBC News, Islamabad They have warned that it threatens to affect other parts of the country. More than 2,000 cases have been reported so far this year, with nearly half of them in Punjab province. Health officials say they are struggling to contain the outbreak due to a lack of resources and awareness about the disease. ""We are facing a shortage of doctors, nurses, and medicine,"" said Dr. Rana Safdar, a spokesman for the Punjab Health Department. ""We also need to raise awareness about dengue fever so that people can protect themselves."" Dengue fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and nausea. In severe cases, dengue fever can lead to bleeding, organ failure, and death. The outbreak in Pakistan has been blamed on a number of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor sanitation, and a lack of mosquito control measures. ""We have been seeing a lot of rain this year, which has created breeding grounds for mosquitoes,"" said Dr. Safdar. ""We also need to improve our sanitation practices and do a better job of controlling mosquitoes."" The Pakistani government has launched a campaign to raise awareness about dengue fever and to encourage people to take steps to protect themselves. The campaign includes distributing pamphlets, airing public service announcements, and setting up mosquito traps. However, health officials say that more needs to be done to contain the outbreak. They are calling on the government to provide more resources and to do a better job of coordinating efforts between different agencies. ""We need to take this outbreak seriously,"" said Dr. Safdar. ""If we don't, it could spread to other parts of the country and cause a major health crisis.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Condor Ferries bought by investment fund,"Condor currently operates between Portsmouth, Poole, Guernsey, Jersey and St Malo, and carries about a million passengers every year. The company was put up for sale in 2018 by its Australian owner the Macquarie Group, which bought it in 2010. Condor's current fleet consists of three fast ferries: Condor Liberation, Condor Voyager and Condor Rapide, as well as two conventional ferries Condor Express and Commodore Goodwill. The company has been facing financial difficulties in recent years, with losses of £13.3m in 2017 and £10.2m in 2018. Macquarie Group said it had decided to sell Condor as it was ""no longer core to its investment strategy"". The sale to Columbia Threadneedle Investments is expected to be completed in the coming months. Columbia Threadneedle Investments is a global investment management firm with over £450bn of assets under management. The company said it was ""delighted"" to have acquired Condor Ferries.

Ant and Dec 'wanted to quit' Britain's Got Talent,"The presenting duo felt they were being ""sidelined"", as segments they filmed for the audition shows kept ""ending up on the cutting room floor"". ""It felt like it may as well have been anyone hosting the show,"" wrote The Sun on Sunday, quoting a source close to the pair. ""They have been left disheartened by the way they've been treated after all these years. Now they're saying they want out."" Ant and Dec declined to comment on their future involvement with Britain's Got Talent when contacted by the BBC. However, ITV sources say they are ""in talks"" with the duo about their future. The company's new chief executive, Carolyn McCall, is said to be keen to keep the pair on board. Ant and Dec's reported disquiet over their role on Britain's Got Talent comes amid a wider shake-up of the show. Long-serving judge David Walliams announced he was leaving the programme earlier this month, and Simon Cowell has hinted that other changes are in the pipeline. ""I think it's a good time to refresh the panel,"" Cowell told The Sun on Sunday. ""We're getting close to the 15th season of the show and I think it's a good time to do it."" It is not clear whether Ant and Dec's decision to quit Britain's Got Talent is linked to the wider changes being made to the show. However, it is clear that the duo are unhappy with their current role. Ant and Dec are one of the most popular and successful TV presenting duos in the UK. They have hosted Britain's Got Talent since its inception in 2007, and have also fronted other popular shows such as I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and Saturday Night Takeaway. Their departure from Britain's Got Talent would be a major blow to the show.

"Over to you, chancellor","Although a cut of a quarter of a percent was not a surprise, a specific message that it would happen was. The Bank welcomed the Budget and claimed it would reduce the risk of a recession. Mr Bailey also reiterated that keeping inflation under control was the Bank's priority. ""There are some signs that global inflation may have peaked, and, of course, there are the energy markets,"" he said. ""It's going to be bumpy, and there are still a lot of risks and uncertainties out there."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) now expects inflation to fall to around 5% by the end of this year, and to the 2% target by 2024. But the committee also revised down its growth forecasts for 2023, from 1.5% to 0.75%. Mr Bailey said the UK economy had ""weakened materially"" since the Bank's last meeting in November, and that the outlook had ""deteriorated materially"". The Bank's decision will have come as a relief to some businesses, which had been calling for a cut in interest rates to help them through the cost of living crisis. But it is likely to be seen as a blow to savers, who have seen the value of their savings eroded by high inflation. The cut in interest rates is the first since March 2020, when the Bank slashed rates to a record low of 0.1% in response to the Covid pandemic. Since then, the Bank has raised rates nine times in a row, as it tries to get inflation under control. The Bank's decision to cut rates now suggests that it believes the economy is slowing down and that the risk of a recession is increasing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions,"Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions By Patrick Cowling & Sadaf Maruf BBC News Home Office figures obtained by the BBC show delays have almost tripled since January 2014, when 484 children had been waiting for more than six months for an asylum decision. Last year, 1,272 under-18s were waiting this long, rising to about 1,300 this year. The situation is so bad, a number of children have received support from specialist trafficking lawyers to argue their asylum cases should be heard more quickly. This is because the government initially refused to screen them for potential risks of harm, such as torture or sexual exploitation. The UK is signed up to the Dublin regulations, which state that asylum applications should be processed in the first safe country an individual enters. But the system does not put a time limit on how long that should take. However, last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the lack of a time limit meant children could be left in legal limbo, and member states have a duty of care. This is why the lawyers have been able to use the court's ruling to challenge the Home Office. They argue that delays, particularly when there has not been an initial screening process, can mean children at risk of serious harm are not identified. The government is now reconsidering its screening policy following a recent judicial review. But Liberty, which brought the case, says there is still no firm commitment from the Home Office to screen all asylum-seeking children. Processing delays in deciding asylum cases are also affecting adults. Home Office data shows it takes around four months on average for a decision to be made about an adult's asylum application. But some foreigners have to wait years to find out if they have the right to remain in the UK. Iraqis are among those who have been experiencing the longest delays and in many cases, have been left destitute, forced into homelessness and barred from work. There are concerns that many have already given up and returned to their home countries. The Home Office says it is processing asylum cases as quickly as possible and that it encourages any asylum seekers who face hardship while their application is being considered to apply for support.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hong Kong: What is China's 'patriot' plan for electoral reform?,"Beijing says the goal is to keep ""unpatriotic"" figures from positions of political power in Hong Kong. But critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, eradicating whatever opposition there is. Under the proposals, a new vetting committee would be set up to screen all candidates for public office. This committee would be composed of members loyal to Beijing, and would have the power to disqualify anyone deemed to be a threat to national security. In addition, the number of directly elected seats in the Legislative Council would be reduced from 35 to 20, while the number of seats appointed by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee would be increased from 30 to 40. These changes would give the pro-Beijing camp an overwhelming majority in the legislature, making it virtually impossible for the opposition to block any government proposals. Critics say these measures would effectively dismantle Hong Kong's democratic system, turning it into a one-party state like mainland China. ""This is a clear attempt to silence dissent and eliminate any form of opposition in Hong Kong,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo. ""It would mark the end of democracy in Hong Kong."" The proposals have also been condemned by the international community. The United States has said that they would ""fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms."" The United Kingdom has said that the proposals ""raise serious concerns about the future of democracy in Hong Kong."" Despite the international outcry, Beijing has remained defiant. It has said that the proposals are necessary to ""safeguard national security"" and ""maintain stability"" in Hong Kong. It is unclear whether Beijing will ultimately go ahead with the proposals. However, the fact that they have been put forward at all is a sign of the increasing pressure that Beijing is putting on Hong Kong. Democracy in Hong Kong has been in decline for several years. In 2014, pro-democracy protesters occupied the streets of Hong Kong for 79 days in a failed attempt to force the government to introduce universal suffrage. Since then, Beijing has cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, arresting pro-democracy activists and closing down independent media outlets. The new electoral reform proposals are the latest in a series of measures designed to tighten Beijing's control over the city. The future of democracy in Hong Kong is uncertain. However, the new electoral reform proposals are a clear indication that Beijing is determined to end it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Iran scientist Shahram Amiri free to leave, US insists","The state department rejected claims by Tehran that Shahram Amiri, who surfaced at a Pakistani embassy building, had been abducted by US agents. Mr Amiri vanished more than a year ago. In June, three videos apparently showing him distressed and allegedly held in the US against his will, were posted on the website of Iranian state media. Later, Iranian state television aired what it said was a phone conversation between Mr Amiri and his mother, in which he said he had been kidnapped by the US, and did not know his whereabouts. On Friday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said the US ""kidnapped"" Mr Amiri in Saudi Arabia in 2009, and the claims he had been working voluntarily for the CIA were untrue. If Mr Amiri's claims are true, it would mean that his account of being forcibly taken from Saudi Arabia to the US contradicts an earlier statement on Iranian state television, which he allegedly made in a phone call to his mother. The phone call to his mother was reported to have taken place on 14 June, while the alleged abduction by US agents is said to have taken place in 2009. However, if Mr Amiri's claims are accurate, it would mean that he was already in US custody at the time of the phone call, which would suggest that the claims made in the phone call are not true. In the videos, Mr Amiri said he was a nuclear scientist working for the Iranian government, and claimed he had been abducted by the US in 2009. The US state department said the videos were ""not credible"", and that Mr Amiri was free to leave the US and return to Iran whenever he wanted. Mr Amiri was a professor at Malek Ashtar University, a military academy in Tehran, and was reportedly involved in Iran's nuclear programme. He disappeared in June 2009 while on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. His wife previously said she believed he was abducted by US agents, but later said she thought he had voluntarily defected to the US.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago,"Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago By Helen Briggs BBC News Scientists found fossilised butterfly scales the size of a speck of dust inside ancient rock from Germany. The find pushes back the date for the origins of the Lepidoptera, the scientific order which includes butterflies and moths, by an extraordinary 25 million years. Previous butterfly fossils had only been found in ancient rocks dating back no more than 175 million years. Now, a team of German researchers has unearthed 12 fossilised butterfly scales trapped in rock around 40m years older than anything seen before. The Lepidoptera evolved from a moth-like ancestor, but the deep fossil record for butterflies is scarce. Studying the microscopic scales under an electron microscope, the researchers noticed finger-like indentations and other features that are characteristic of butterflies, distinguishing them from moth scales. The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest that butterflies emerged earlier than previously thought, perhaps as early as 200 million years ago during the Triassic period. ""This makes our butterflies the oldest modern butterflies ever found,"" said study lead author Dr. André Nel of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. The butterfly scales were found in fine-grained limestone rock that was once mud and silt at the bottom of a shallow ocean. The limestone was deposited in what is now the Saar region in western Germany. Dr. Nel said that the discovery was ""wonderful and very exciting"" and added that the butterflies would have been tiny, about the size of a hummingbird. “We see an incredible diversity of butterflies in the Triassic,” he said, adding: “It means that as soon as butterflies appear, they show a rather large amount of anatomical variation."" The researchers say that the butterfly scales, with their display of fine features that are diagnostic for butterfly scales, are unlikely to be mistaken for those of any other insect group. They conclude that butterflies probably went through an explosive evolutionary episode in the middle of the Triassic. The team now plans to look for butterfly fossils in other ancient rocks. They hope to find preserved adult butterfly fossils, which would give a better idea of how these creatures looked 200 million years ago.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Guildford Four's Gerry Conlon: Funeral takes place in Belfast,"His coffin was carried into St Peter's Cathedral in west Belfast by four members of the Birmingham Six. Mr Conlon, who was wrongly convicted of the IRA pub bombings in 1974, died on 21 June aged 60. Among the mourners at the funeral were Mr Conlon's sisters, Anne and Kate, and his brother, Michael. His wife, Sarah, died in 2008. The service was led by Bishop Noel Treanor, who said Mr Conlon was ""a man of courage, resilience and dignity"". ""He was an innocent man who was never broken by the injustice he suffered,"" the bishop said. ""He never gave up hope that one day he would be free and cleared of the terrible crimes he was falsely accused of."" The service was followed by a private burial at Milltown Cemetery. Mr Conlon's wrongful conviction was one of the most high-profile miscarriages of justice in British legal history. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1975, along with five other men who became known as the Guildford Four. The four were convicted of carrying out the IRA pub bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974, which killed five people and injured many others. However, their convictions were overturned in 1989 after it emerged that police had fabricated evidence against them. Mr Conlon spent 15 years in prison before he was finally released. He went on to campaign for justice for other victims of miscarriages of justice. In 2001, he was awarded £5m in compensation for his wrongful conviction. In a statement released after his death, Mr Conlon's family said he had been ""a loving husband, father, brother and uncle"". ""He was a man of great integrity and courage, who never gave up fighting for justice,"" the statement said. ""He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""Essential skills"" include ""excellent risk management and media handling experience"". The role is the latest in a series of measures designed to enhance Johnson's public image, which has suffered in recent months due to the ongoing Partygate scandal and the cost-of-living crisis. Critics have described the move as a ""PR stunt"" and a ""waste of taxpayers' money"". Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: ""This is yet another desperate attempt by Boris Johnson to cling on to power. He has lost the trust of the public and his own party, and this latest move will do nothing to change that."" However, Johnson's allies have defended the decision, arguing that it is necessary to ensure that the prime minister's message is communicated effectively to the public. Downing Street sources said that the new spokesperson would not be a ""mouthpiece for the prime minister"", but would instead provide ""factual information about the government's work and policies"". The move is also seen as an attempt to emulate the White House press briefings, which are held daily by the US president's press secretary. These briefings have become a key part of the US political landscape, and are closely followed by journalists and the public alike. It is unclear whether the new spokesperson will be as successful as their White House counterparts. However, the move is a clear sign that Johnson is determined to improve his public image and regain the trust of the British people.

EU-student funding guarantee extended,"By Katherine Sellgren BBC News education reporter And these students' loans and grants will be available for the duration of their degree. This is because the Department for Education has extended its funding guarantee for EU students, who started courses in England in autumn 2021, until they complete their studies. The guarantee means that these students will continue to be eligible for the same level of support as UK students, including access to student loans, grants and scholarships. This is a significant change from previous years, when EU students were only eligible for student loans for the first year of their studies. The extension of the funding guarantee is a welcome relief for many EU students, who were facing uncertainty about their future funding. One of those students is 22-year-old Eva from Spain, who is studying medicine at the University of Manchester. ""I was so worried about how I was going to afford to continue my studies after the first year,"" she says. ""But now I know that I will be able to complete my degree, thanks to this funding guarantee."" The funding guarantee is also a positive step for the UK higher education sector, which relies on EU students for a significant proportion of its income. In the 2020-21 academic year, there were over 140,000 EU students studying in the UK. These students contributed £2.6bn to the UK economy, according to Universities UK. The extension of the funding guarantee is a sign that the UK government is committed to supporting the higher education sector and ensuring that the UK remains an attractive destination for international students. However, some experts have warned that the funding guarantee could be undermined by the government's plans to introduce a new post-study work visa for international students. The new visa will allow international students to stay in the UK for two years after they graduate, to work or look for work. But it is not clear whether EU students will be eligible for the new visa, which could make it harder for them to remain in the UK after their studies. The government has said that it is still considering the eligibility criteria for the new visa, and that it will make an announcement in due course.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
General Election: Loyalists warn unionists not to vote Alliance,"By Mark Devenport BBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) was launched in 2015. In a statement, it said that ""any unionist who votes for the Alliance Party is driving a stake into the heart of unionism"". The LCC is an umbrella group representing loyalist paramilitary organisations. It said that the Alliance Party ""cannot be trusted"" and that ""they will never stand up for the interests of unionism"". The LCC's statement comes after the Alliance Party made gains in the recent local government elections. The Alliance Party is a centrist party that does not identify as either unionist or nationalist. It is the largest party on Belfast City Council and the second-largest party in Northern Ireland. The LCC's warning to unionists not to vote for the Alliance Party is a sign of the growing tensions between unionists and centrists in Northern Ireland. Unionists believe that the Alliance Party is a threat to their goal of maintaining Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom. Centrists, on the other hand, believe that the Alliance Party is the only party that can build a shared future for everyone in Northern Ireland. The LCC's statement is likely to further alienate centrists from unionism. It is also likely to make it more difficult for the Alliance Party to make further gains in the next Assembly election. The Assembly election is due to be held in May 2022. The LCC's statement is a reminder of the deep divisions that still exist in Northern Ireland. It is also a warning that the peace process is still fragile and that there is still a long way to go before Northern Ireland can truly be at peace.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid-19: Northamptonshire moves to tier 3,"The county, currently in tier two, will face the higher level of restrictions from 00:01 GMT on 26 December, the government has announced. People in tier three can form bubbles with another household on Christmas Day, but not stay overnight. They are also being urged not to travel to other parts of the UK unless it is for essential reasons. The move to tier three in Northamptonshire follows a rise in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks. The seven-day infection rate in the county is now 160.3 cases per 100,000 people, well above the England average of 127.5. The government said the decision to move Northamptonshire to tier three was made after taking into account a number of factors, including the number of cases, the rate of transmission, the number of hospital admissions and the capacity of the local NHS. The new restrictions in Northamptonshire will include: A ban on household mixing indoors, except for Christmas Day when one household can mix with one other household. A ban on meeting anyone outside your household in a private garden. A ban on meeting anyone outside your household in a public place, except for organised sports and exercise. A ban on travel between different parts of the UK, unless for essential reasons. The government said the restrictions would be reviewed every two weeks. Matt Golby, North Northamptonshire's council leader, said the move to tier three was ""disappointing"" but ""understandable"". ""The decision was not taken lightly,"" he said.

Gamer Hbomberguy hands funding row charity Donkey Kong boost,"YouTuber Hbomberguy made £265,000 by playing Nintendo 64's Donkey Kong live online after a proposed lottery grant for Mermaids was put under review. Father Ted sitcom writer Graham Linehan had expressed concerns about Mermaids' approach to supporting transgender children. Mermaids later accused Linehan of spreading ""anti-trans hate speech"", and Linehan has faced calls to be banned from Twitter. Hbomberguy, a vocal supporter of transgender rights, began livestreaming the Donkey Kong marathon in response to these events. He aimed to raise £1,000 for Mermaids but quickly surpassed that target. ""I usually just play games that I like and stream them. But this is a real situation that's impacting people's lives, and I wanted to do something to help,"" Hbomberguy told the BBC. ""I'm not a charity, but I have a platform, and I can use that to raise awareness and funds for Mermaids."" Hbomberguy's marathon lasted for over 57 hours, during which time he played Donkey Kong and responded to donations from viewers. The stream attracted over 500,000 viewers and raised a total of £265,000 for Mermaids. ""I'm so grateful to Hbomberguy and everyone who donated to this fundraiser,"" said Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids. ""This money will make a huge difference to our work supporting transgender children and their families."" The fundraiser has been praised by many in the gaming community, who have hailed Hbomberguy as a hero. However, some have criticized the fundraiser, arguing that it is unfair to target Linehan for his views. ""I think it's important to remember that Graham Linehan has the right to his opinion, even if we don't agree with it,"" said one Twitter user.

Olympic Games £500k steam cloud artwork in Wirral delayed,"The £500,000 publicly funded spinning column of cloud was set to rise over the Wirral estuary from 31 December as part of the UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK project. However, strong winds have forced the postponement of the artwork by Liverpool-based artist,  Anthony McCall. The 200m-high column, titled Between the Ear and the Eye, will now take place at an alternative location on Thurstaton Common from 27-30 January. The relocation is due to safety concerns as high winds can affect the stability of the column. The 10-minute artwork is part of the UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK project, which is a government-funded initiative to bring large scale, free public artworks to towns and cities across the UK as part of the 2022 Festival. The artwork is meant to evoke the iconic image of the Olympic rings and will be visible from across the Mersey estuary. It will be made up of a series of spinning clouds of steam, creating a dynamic and ever-changing sculpture in the sky. The artist said: ""This new outdoor artwork is conceived specifically for the Wirral peninsula, Liverpool City Region and its communities. Through the transformative properties of steam, Between the Ear and the Eye, taps into our shared histories of invention, industry and migration in this area, while also looking towards the future. ""As you view the artwork from different vantage points, it presents multiple shifting and dynamic perspectives which both connect and divide the viewer from the work, and from each other."" The cloud column will be visible from the Wirral side of the estuary, as well as from Liverpool and parts of North Wales. It will be accompanied by a soundscape composed by Matthew Herbert. The artist,  Anthony McCall, is known for his pioneering work with film and installation. His work has been exhibited in major galleries around the world, including the Tate Modern in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK project is a government-funded initiative to bring large scale, free public artworks to towns and cities across the UK as part of the 2022 Festival.

Not guilty plea in landmark Kodi box trial,"By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter Mr Thompson is accused of selling ""fully loaded"" Kodi boxes, modified with software that allowed users to stream copyrighted content for free. The prosecution claims the boxes are illegal because they bypass copyright protections. But Mr Thompson's lawyer argued that the boxes are not illegal because they do not contain any copyrighted content themselves. He said users are responsible for what they stream on the boxes. The jury has been told that Mr Thompson sold more than 100,000 Kodi boxes. The trial is expected to last two weeks. Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. It allows users to play videos, music, and other digital media on a variety of devices. Kodi can be installed on computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. It is compatible with a wide range of file formats, including AVI, MP4, MKV, and WMV. Kodi can also be used to stream live TV and radio. In 2015, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) filed a lawsuit against the XBMC Foundation, alleging that Kodi was being used to facilitate copyright infringement. The MPAA argued that Kodi was being used to stream pirated movies and TV shows. The XBMC Foundation denies these allegations and argues that Kodi is a legitimate software application that can be used for a variety of purposes. The lawsuit is still pending. The trial of Mr Thompson is the first of its kind in the UK. It is unclear whether the outcome of the trial will have any impact on the use of Kodi in the UK. However, the trial is sure to raise awareness of the issue of copyright infringement and the role of Kodi in this issue.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Surrey Police investigation over 'misgendering' tweets,"Caroline Farrow said Surrey Police wants to ""conduct a taped interview under caution"" because of tweets posted in October. They were made after she was accused of misgendering a transgender woman in a previous tweet. In the October tweets, Ms Farrow said she was responding to ""what she believed was a series of tweets by a man"", who had previously been protected by an interim Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). The tweets that prompted the police investigation cannot be published for legal reasons. GRCs were introduced under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and allow transgender people to change their legal gender. However, Ms Farrow has previously argued that the 2004 Act allows ""male-bodied people to self-identify into the female sex and access women-only spaces, resources and opportunities."" Following the complaint about her October tweets, Surrey Police confirmed that the case was being investigated and a file had been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS subsequently decided not to press charges against Ms Farrow. Mark Burns-Williamson, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey, said the decision not to prosecute was ""wholly unsatisfactory"". He said the force had ""tried to do the right thing"" and had acted in ""good faith"". Surrey Police referred questions on its current investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC said it was ""assessing the available information to determine what further action may be required."" Ms Farrow, a former magistrate and journalist, stood unsuccessfully for the Brexit Party in the 2019 General Election. She has previously been a vocal critic of the Gender Recognition Act and has said she believes it ""undermines"" the rights of women. In a statement, she said she was ""appalled"" by the police investigation and accused Surrey Police of ""trying to silence"" her. ""I am a law-abiding citizen and I have done nothing wrong,"" she said. ""The police are wasting their time and resources on this investigation when they should be focusing on real crimes."" The investigation is the latest in a series of cases involving police investigations into alleged ""hate speech"" online. In 2020, a man was arrested for ""inciting hatred"" after he posted a tweet that was critical of transgender people. The case was later dropped, but it raised concerns about the potential for freedom of speech to be curtailed in the name of protecting minority groups.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wife of 39 years fails in divorce refusal appeal,"Tini Owens, 66, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling, which said she could not divorce her husband Hugh Owens, 78. But the appeal judges, led by Sir Geoffrey Vos, unanimously dismissed her challenge. They said the original judge had been right to conclude that the marriage had not irretrievably broken down and that it was possible for the couple to reconcile. Mrs Owens had argued that she could not reasonably be expected to live with her husband after 40 years of marriage, during which time she had been subjected to “coercive and controlling” behavior. She said Mr Owens had isolated her from her friends and family, had stopped her from working, and had made her feel like a “prisoner” in her own home. But the Court of Appeal judges said that Mrs Owens had not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims. They said that she had only made general allegations of controlling behavior and had not provided any specific examples. They also said that Mrs Owens had not shown that she had taken any steps to try to improve the situation, such as seeking help from a therapist or counselor. The judges said that it was clear that the couple had some difficulties in their relationship, but they said that these difficulties were not so serious that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. They said that it was possible for the couple to reconcile if they were willing to work on their relationship and seek help from a therapist or counselor. The judges also said that they were taking into account the fact that the couple had been married for a long time and had built up a life together. They said that it would be wrong to end the marriage without giving the couple a chance to try to reconcile. Mrs Owens said she was “disappointed” with the Court of Appeal's decision. She said she was determined to divorce her husband and would continue to fight for her freedom.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
North Korea: Mike Pompeo rejects 'gangster-like' accusation,"After two days of talks with senior officials, he said efforts to push Pyongyang towards abandoning nuclear weapons had international support. His comments were released in a statement, after Mr Pompeo left North Korea. ""As we work to implement the commitments from the Singapore summit, the US is committed, along with our allies in the region, to a brighter future for the Korean people on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. ""North Korea made clear to us that they understand the need to denuclearize,"" he added. ""We look forward to continuing these discussions in Singapore on 12th June."" However, analysts said that despite the talks, North Korea has not made any concrete commitment to scrap its nuclear arsenal. And some have said that the Trump administration is being too eager to trust Pyongyang's promises. Mr Pompeo's comments also come just two days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to pull out of his planned summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore next month. Mr Kim said he would not attend if the US tried to force him to give up his nuclear weapons. In response, Mr Trump said he was still confident that the summit would go ahead. He has also warned that he is ready to scrap the summit if he doesn't believe North Korea is serious about denuclearisation. The Singapore summit is the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. It is the culmination of months of diplomatic efforts to bring the two sides to the negotiating table. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome, including the issue of nuclear weapons. North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and missiles since the 1990s. It is thought to have up to 60 nuclear warheads, and is developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US. The US has long considered North Korea's nuclear programme to be a threat to its security. It has imposed tough sanctions on the country, and has threatened military action if necessary.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UN net meeting 'hit by hackers' causing website disruption,"The World Conference on International Telecommunications (Wcit) is debating changes to a wide-ranging communications treaty. Delegates were unable to access material relating to the meeting after its website was forced offline. Hacker groups had claimed responsibility, organisers said. The UN's secretary general António Guterres addressed the summit on Monday from New York. He hailed the conference as a ""historic opportunity"" to establish a new era of global co-operation. ""We are living in a world awash with new technologies, which are changing our lives in ways we could scarcely have imagined,"" he said. ""But with these new technologies come new challenges, and new responsibilities."" Mr Guterres said the summit was an opportunity to establish a ""new global consensus"" on how to use technology for the benefit of all. The website for the conference was taken offline on Tuesday, the second day of the meeting. A spokesperson for the organisers said the website had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This type of attack involves flooding a website with so much traffic that it becomes inaccessible to users. A hacker group called Anonymous had claimed responsibility for the attack. The group said it was protesting against the proposed changes to the treaty, which it said would give governments too much control over the internet. The treaty in question is known as the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs). It has been in place since 1988 and sets out the rules for how telecommunications networks are managed and operated. The proposed changes to the treaty would give governments more power to regulate the internet. This has raised concerns among some human rights groups, who say it could be used to censor online content. The World Conference on International Telecommunications is taking place in Dubai and is due to end on 16 December.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer',"Trial results coming out of a US cancer conference suggest the treatment works better than standard chemotherapy. Nivolumab significantly improved the survival odds of patients with these hard-to-treat tumours. Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and in the UK there are around 12,000 new cases every year. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and, until now, their prognosis has been very poor. Nivolumab is an immunotherapy drug and works by blocking a protein on the surface of immune cells called PD-1. This allows the immune system to recognise and attack the cancer cells. The CheckMate 141 trial involved nearly 400 patients with advanced head and neck cancer and compared nivolumab with standard chemotherapy. After a year, 36% of those treated with nivolumab were still alive, compared with 17% of those who received chemotherapy. Median overall survival improved from 10.7 months to 14.3 months. The treatment was also found to significantly reduce the risk of the disease progressing, or recurring. Dr Ursula Nestle, lead author, said: ""This is a practice-changing study because it is the first to show a significant improvement in overall survival for these hard-to-treat head and neck cancer patients."" Dr Nishant Agrawal, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, said: ""This is a game-changer. It changes the management and the approach to patients with head and neck cancer."" He said the treatment was particularly promising for those who are not able to receive standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. ""These are patients who are in pain, bleeding, and who have difficulty with eating and drinking,"" he said. The results of the study were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago. Nivolumab has not yet been approved by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), but Dr Nestle said she hoped this would change in the light of the new findings. She added: ""I don't think it will take long. The data are very compelling.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Further clashes over work on NI port controls,"In July, the UK government announced that it would delay the introduction of full checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK until October. The EU has said that it is willing to discuss changes to the protocol, but only within the limits of the existing agreement. The latest row comes after the UK government published a command paper setting out its plans for implementing the protocol. The paper said that the UK would introduce a ""grace period"" for checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, and that it would not implement checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. The EU has said that the UK's plans are not compatible with the protocol, and that it will take legal action if the UK does not implement the protocol in full. The UK government has said that it is committed to implementing the protocol, but that it needs to do so in a way that protects the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is a peace agreement that was signed in 1998 and ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The row over the protocol is the latest in a series of disputes between the UK and the EU over Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and the two sides are still negotiating a trade agreement. The dispute over the protocol has raised concerns about the future of the Good Friday Agreement. The agreement is based on the principle of cross-border cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and some fear that the protocol could undermine this cooperation. The UK government has said that it is committed to the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will not do anything that could put it at risk. However, the EU has said that the UK's plans for implementing the protocol are not compatible with the agreement. The dispute over the protocol is a complex and difficult issue, and it is unclear how it will be resolved. However, it is clear that the issue has the potential to damage relations between the UK and the EU, and to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zika virus: 'Strongest evidence yet' of effect on babies,"Dr Tom Frieden, head of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), was testifying before politicians in Washington. He said that data from the cases of two infants in Brazil showed ""the strongest evidence yet"" that the Zika virus can cause brain damage in babies. The babies were born in Brazil and had severe brain defects. Their mothers had been infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy. Dr Frieden said that the data ""adds to the growing body of evidence that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of brain defects."" He said that the CDC is now recommending that pregnant women consider not traveling to areas where Zika virus is spreading. The CDC has also issued a travel warning for pregnant women to avoid areas where Zika virus is spreading. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the Zika virus. The virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which is also responsible for transmitting dengue fever and chikungunya. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Pregnant women should take extra precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in air-conditioned areas. If a pregnant woman is infected with the Zika virus, she should see her doctor immediately. The Zika virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact. Men who have traveled to areas where Zika virus is spreading should use condoms during sex with their pregnant partners. The Zika virus is a serious threat to pregnant women and their unborn babies. It is important to take steps to prevent infection and to seek medical care if you are infected.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

HS2 underground protest: Activists 'being forced out' of tunnel,"HS2 Rebellion, who are camped out at Euston Square Gardens, say the team is burrowing a vertical tunnel causing crumbs of earth to fall onto their camp. They say the noise and dust is making it very difficult to stay and that they are concerned about their safety. HS2 Ltd said it was aware of the concerns and that it was taking steps to minimise the impact of the work on the protesters. It said a ""dialogue"" was ongoing. The protesters have been camped out in the gardens since the end of August, in protest at the HS2 high-speed rail line. They say the line will cause environmental damage and that the government should be investing in public transport instead. In recent weeks, the protesters have been joined by Extinction Rebellion activists, who have been blocking roads and bridges in London in protest at the government's climate change policies. The HS2 project has been beset by delays and cost overruns. It was originally due to open in 2026, but is now not expected to be completed until 2034. The cost of the project has also risen from £56bn to £106bn. The government has said that HS2 is a vital infrastructure project that will boost the economy and create jobs. However, critics say that the project is too expensive and that the money would be better spent on other projects. The protests against HS2 have been ongoing for several years. In 2019, activists staged a series of demonstrations, including blocking the M4 motorway. In 2020, activists occupied a construction site in Buckinghamshire. The protests have led to a number of arrests and convictions. In 2020, nine activists were jailed for contempt of court after they refused to leave the construction site in Buckinghamshire. The government has said that it respects the right to protest, but that it will not tolerate illegal activity. It has also said that it is committed to HS2 and that the project will go ahead. The protests are likely to continue until the HS2 line is completed. The activists say they are determined to stop the project and that they will not give up until they have succeeded.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Bishop Peter Ball victim withdraws from church abuse review,"Peter Ball, 84, was jailed in October for offences against 18 teenagers and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. One of his victims, Rev Graham Sawyer, said he had taken the decision ""with great sadness"" after his requests for a role in shaping the review were rejected. ""I believe in Jesus and I love his church, but I can no longer be part of this particular institution,"" Sawyer said in a statement released by his lawyer. The Church of England announced last month that it would be holding an independent review into safeguarding failures that allowed Ball's abuse to continue undetected for decades. The review, to be led by retired High Court judge Sir David Calvert-Smith, will examine how the church responded to allegations against Ball and whether there were any systemic failings that allowed him to continue in his role. Sawyer said he had been ""deeply disappointed"" by the church's response to his request to be involved in the review. ""I had hoped that my experience and insights as a survivor of abuse within the church would be of value to the review,"" he said. ""However, it has become clear that the church is not willing to listen to the voices of survivors. This is a betrayal of trust and a missed opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past."" The Church of England said it understood Sawyer's decision and that it remained committed to listening to the voices of survivors. ""We deeply regret the pain and suffering that Graham Sawyer has experienced,"" a spokesperson said. ""We understand his decision to withdraw from the review and we will continue to work to ensure that the review is as comprehensive and independent as possible."" Ball was the Bishop of Lewes from 1977 to 1992 and the Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 to 2001. He was convicted of sexually abusing 18 teenagers and young men over a period of 20 years. His victims included young men who had been invited to stay at his home in Chichester and students at the theological college where he taught. Ball was sentenced to 32 months in prison in October 2015. He was released from prison in February 2017 after serving half of his sentence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Alstom: GE and French state agree to work on new offer,"France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg said that neither the GE bid, nor a joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer, met the government's demands. But the government had been presented with a new offer from GE and Alstom that he said provided ""real guarantees"". Montebourg said the government would now enter into exclusive negotiations with GE and Alstom, and that he hoped a final deal could be reached by the end of July. GE's initial offer for Alstom was worth €12.35bn (£10bn), while Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had offered €11.6bn. GE has since increased its offer to €12.4bn, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to satisfy the French government. The French government is keen to protect Alstom's independence, and has said it will not approve any deal that would see the company lose its status as a French champion. GE has said it is committed to maintaining Alstom's headquarters in France and its research and development centre in Belfort. However, the government is also concerned about the impact of the deal on employment. GE has said it will cut 6,500 jobs at Alstom, but the government wants to ensure that these cuts are limited to the company's overseas operations. The government is also concerned about the impact of the deal on Alstom's technology. GE has said it will invest €1bn in Alstom's research and development, but the government wants to ensure that this investment is used to develop new technologies in France. The negotiations between GE and the French government are expected to be tough, but both sides are keen to reach an agreement. GE needs Alstom to expand its presence in the global energy market, while the French government needs GE to invest in Alstom's technology and protect its independence. If a deal can be reached, it would be a major coup for GE and a major blow to Siemens. It would also be a significant victory for the French government, which has been determined to protect Alstom's independence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Covid: New lockdown needed, say Yorkshire leaders","Schools in England have shut to most pupils and people have been asked to stay at home under tighter rules. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said: ""We believe that a short, sharp, national lockdown is now necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to save lives."" He said that the current restrictions were not enough to stop the spread of the virus, and that a ""circuit break"" was needed to give the NHS time to recover. ""We know that a lockdown will be difficult for many people, but we believe it is the right thing to do to protect our communities,"" he said. The call for a lockdown has been echoed by other leaders in the region, including the Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin. She said: ""We are facing a very serious situation in Yorkshire and the Humber. The number of cases is rising rapidly and our hospitals are coming under increasing pressure. ""We need to take urgent action to prevent our NHS from being overwhelmed. A short, sharp lockdown is the best way to do this."" The leaders have written to the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, asking him to impose a national lockdown. A spokesperson for the government said that the Prime Minister was ""keeping all options on the table"" but that he was not currently planning to impose a national lockdown.

The new measures have been welcomed by some, but others have expressed concern about the impact they will have on the economy and on people's mental health. It is not yet clear whether the new measures will be enough to stop the spread of the virus, and it is possible that the government will be forced to impose a national lockdown in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Bloodhound takes first drive across the desert,"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Pilot Andy Green took the jet-powered vehicle on a gentle 100mph (160km/h) shakedown test run on Friday. Bloodhound is in Northern Cape for high-speed trials as it works towards a world land speed record attempt of 1,000mph (1,600km/h) in 2023. Friday's run began with engineers simulating the conditions the car will experience when it's flat out at Mach 1.4. The team fired the rocket that will eventually provide most of the vehicle's thrust, but kept the rocket's throttle low to limit speeds. The vehicle then drove for 5km along a straight section of the 12-mile (19km) Hakskeen Pan track. It will now stay on the surface to have its data systems checked over the next 10 days. The Bloodhound car has been in development since 2008. Originally, the team behind the project hoped to break the 1,000mph barrier in 2015. But the effort has been beset by funding and technical setbacks. Bloodhound's shakedown run on Friday was conducted without driver Andy Green onboard. The aim of the exercise was to test the vehicle's systems, including its rocket and its parachute recovery system. Green will take the wheel for the first time on Monday. He will drive the car at progressively higher speeds, culminating in a 200mph (320km/h) run on Friday of next week. ""This is a fantastic moment for the team and a real milestone in the project,"" said Green. ""We're now one step closer to our goal of setting a new world land speed record."" The Bloodhound project is a privately funded venture that aims to push the boundaries of engineering and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. If successful, Bloodhound will become the first vehicle to break the 1,000mph barrier on land. The current record of 763mph (1,228km/h) was set by ThrustSSC in 1997.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Farm profits may halve after Brexit, says report","The report, by the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), says the ""worst-case scenario"" would cut average farm profits from £38,000 a year to just £18,000. The AHDB says this is because farmers will lose access to the EU's single market, which allows them to sell their products tariff-free. This will make it more expensive for them to export to the EU, which is their biggest market. The report also warns that farmers will face new costs from having to comply with new regulations and tariffs, which will further reduce their profits. The AHDB's report is based on a survey of 1,000 farmers. The survey found that 80% of farmers are concerned about the impact of Brexit on their businesses. The report has been welcomed by farming organisations, who say it highlights the need for the government to support farmers through Brexit. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the report was a ""wake-up call"" for the government. The NFU said the government needs to provide financial support to farmers and help them to prepare for Brexit. The government has said it is committed to supporting farmers through Brexit. The government has announced a £3 billion package of support for farmers, which includes funding for research and development, and grants to help farmers invest in new equipment. However, the NFU said the government's support package was not enough and that more needs to be done. The NFU said the government needs to do more to help farmers prepare for the new regulations and tariffs that will come into force after Brexit. The government has said it is working with farmers to help them prepare for Brexit. The government has set up a task force to help farmers with the new regulations and tariffs. The government has also said it is committed to maintaining the UK's high food safety and environmental standards after Brexit. The government has said it will not lower food standards in order to secure a trade deal with the EU.

Covid: Will Margaret Ferrier remain an MP after breaking rules?,"And the SNP has said if she does not stand down, the party will seek to have her expelled from the House of Commons. Ms Ferrier has said she is ""deeply sorry"" for her actions and has apologised to the people of Rutherglen and Hamilton West. She has also said that she will ""co-operate fully"" with the police investigation. The Metropolitan Police has said that it is investigating a ""potential offence"" under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. The regulations make it an offence for anyone to know that they have the virus and leave their home, or fail to self-isolate if they have been instructed to do so by a public health official. The maximum penalty for breaching the regulations is a £10,000 fine. Ms Ferrier is the first MP to be accused of breaking the coronavirus regulations. The case has raised questions about whether MPs should be subject to the same rules as everyone else. Some people have argued that MPs should be held to a higher standard, as they are public figures. Others have said that MPs should be treated the same as everyone else, and that it is up to the police to decide whether or not to investigate. The case is also likely to put pressure on the government to review the current coronavirus regulations. Some people have argued that the regulations are too strict and that they are having a disproportionate impact on people's lives. Others have said that the regulations are necessary to protect public health.

UKIP make their mark in Scotland,"Brian Taylor Political editor, Scotland So, quite deliberately, I grabbed the chance today to offer my congratulations to each of Scotland's elected MEPs among the throng gathered in Edinburgh City Chambers for the final declaration. And commiseration. After an election which, in many ways, was a bit of a damp squib, there was a palpable sense of anti-climax as the formal announcement was made of the 6 MEPs elected to represent Scotland in the European Parliament. Only 35% of the electorate voted. That's a record low. And, as a consequence, Nigel Farage's UKIP now has its first MEPs in Scotland. Two of them - David Coburn and David McHugh. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall believes this is the start of something big north of the border. ""This is the thin end of the wedge. We know from our polls, from our membership numbers, this thing is growing and growing. And that's what people need to be aware of."" There was, of course, no formal election night celebration planned by UKIP in Scotland last night. But at a city centre bar, there was a gathering of supporters and elected representatives - including Mr Coburn. In an interview with me, he said the election of two UKIP MEPs to Strasbourg was: ""A kick in the teeth for the establishment."" ""It proves that the status quo is not good enough,"" he said. ""People want change and they want it now."" So what of the other parties? Labour remain Scotland's largest party in the parliament, despite losing one of their previous three seats. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was keen to point out that his party secured nearly twice as many votes as UKIP. ""We topped the poll in Scotland, the Labour Party. And I'm very proud of that."" The SNP also lost one of their previous two seats. They now have two MEPs, including 19-year-old Alyn Smith, the youngest politician ever to be elected to the European Parliament. He said the SNP's ""positive"" and ""optimistic"" message was what attracted voters to their party. ""We showed that, even in this referendum Parliament, that we are the most positive, optimistic party in Scotland."" Ruth Davidson's Conservatives secured one seat and there was also one seat for the Liberal Democrats. Catherine Stihler topped the poll for her party, just as she did 5 years ago. She said the result was ""a difficult night"" for her party across the UK but she was pleased to win a seat for the Lib Dems in Scotland. So, UKIP has made its mark in Scotland, albeit on a relatively low turnout. The challenge for the party now is to build on what they have achieved and become a more significant player on the Scottish political stage. As for the other parties, they will be looking to the future and with the next Scottish parliament election in 2 years, they will need to ensure they are ready to challenge the SNP's dominance of Scottish politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zero waste society plans for Scotland unveiled,"Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said it was time to tackle nearly 20m tonnes of waste currently produced by Scotland every year. The zero waste plan includes: A ban on sending biodegradable waste to landfill by 2021. A 70% recycling target by 2025. A deposit return scheme for drinks containers. A ban on microbeads in cosmetics. The Scottish Government will also invest £70m in new recycling infrastructure. The plans have been welcomed by environmental groups. ""This is a bold and ambitious plan that has the potential to make Scotland a world leader in waste reduction,"" said Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. ""The Scottish Government has listened to the public and is taking action to tackle the growing problem of waste."" The Scottish Conservatives have also welcomed the plans, but have called for the government to go further. ""We need to see more detail on how these plans will be implemented and funded,"" said Murdo Fraser, the party's environment spokesman. ""We also need to see a stronger focus on reducing waste at source."" Zero waste is a term used to describe a society that produces little or no waste. This can be achieved through a combination of measures, such as: Reducing consumption. Reusing items. Recycling materials. Composting organic waste. Zero waste societies are often more sustainable than traditional societies, as they reduce the amount of pollution and greenhouse gases produced. They can also be more resilient, as they are less reliant on finite resources. The Scottish Government's zero waste plan is a significant step towards creating a more sustainable Scotland. If successful, it will help to reduce the country's environmental impact and create a more resilient society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Views sought on new ideas to further regenerate Cardiff,"Replacing the current St David's Dewi Sant shopping centre with new office, retail and leisure space, and demolishing the NCP car park and Capitol Shopping Centre for a new residential, workspace, hotel and leisure hub are among the suggested projects. The proposals have been outlined in a consultation which splits the city into five areas for different types of development. The Central Cardiff area covers the city centre and Cardiff Bay. Replacing the current St David's Dewi Sant shopping centre with new office, retail and leisure space, and demolishing the NCP car park and Capitol Shopping Centre for a new residential, workspace, hotel and leisure hub are among the suggested projects. The Inner Cardiff area includes Butetown, Riverside and Pontcanna. It proposes a mix of residential, commercial, educational and cultural uses to ""intensify and diversify the offer"". The East Cardiff area covers Splott, Tremorfa and Adamsdown. The proposals here focus on ""enhancing and improving local services"" by delivering new homes, employment and leisure opportunities. The North Cardiff area includes Cathays, Roath and Gabalfa. The council wants to create a ""vibrant health innovation district"" around Cardiff University's new £300m innovation campus at the former Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The West Cardiff area covers Grangetown, Riverside and Cardiff Bay. The proposals include the potential for new homes, a new school and improvements to public spaces. The council said the new ideas would ""build on the momentum"" of recent regeneration projects in the city, including the Central Square development, the redevelopment of Cardiff Market and the opening of the new Cardiff Bus Interchange. It added that the plans would help to ""create a more vibrant, sustainable and inclusive city"" and would ""support the city's economy and create jobs"". The consultation is open until 12 December. Cllr Russell Goodway, Cardiff council's cabinet member for investment and development, said: ""We are committed to making Cardiff a better place to live, work and visit.

Kashmir uproar over Afzal Guru clemency plea,"By Mehboob Khan BBC News A resolution had been tabled on the case of Afzal Guru, who was convicted over the 2001 India parliament attack. Sheikh said that ""the real culprits behind the attack are still at large,"" suggesting that the supreme court had ""hastened"" Guru's execution three years ago and that the Afzal Guru family had been ""denied justice."" The government in New Delhi has not commented on the resolution, but the speaker of the state assembly, Kavinder Gupta, adjourned the proceedings until next week. Guru was sentenced to death in 2002 for his role in the attack on India's parliament in 2001. He was hanged in Delhi's Tihar jail in February 2013, aged 43. Guru's family and supporters long maintained that the trial was unfair and that he was made a scapegoat. They argue that Afzal Guru was not present at the time of the attack and that the evidence against him was fabricated . The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly is the latest sign of growing support for Guru's family and campaigners who believe he was wrongly executed. The attack on the Indian parliament on 13 December 2001 left 14 people dead, including five attackers. The attack was blamed on Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir. The neighbours have been locked in a bitter territorial dispute over the Himalayan region since then. Pakistan denies any involvement in the parliament attack, but India says it has ""incontrovertible evidence"" of Islamabad's involvement. The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly has been welcomed by the Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of separatist leaders in Kashmir. The conference said that the resolution ""vindicates our stand that Afzal Guru was innocent and his execution was a travesty of justice. The resolution is also likely to raise tensions between India and Pakistan. India has already accused Pakistan of interfering in its internal affairs. The Indian government has said that it will not tolerate any interference in its internal affairs and that it will take all necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and integrity. The resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly is a significant development. It is the first time that a state assembly in India has passed a resolution calling for the reopening of the Afzal Guru case.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Robin Gibb: Bee Gees singer's funeral held in Thame,"Hundreds of fans lined the streets of Thame earlier as a lone bagpiper led a procession through the town. Gibb's body was carried in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by two Irish wolfhounds and guests, including his brother Barry and his son Adam. The service was held at St Mary's Church, where Gibb was a regular worshipper. It was a private ceremony, but fans were able to watch the procession and listen to the service on loudspeakers outside the church. Gibb's widow, Dwina, gave a reading during the service, and his son Robin-John performed a song. Gibb's brother Barry also spoke, paying tribute to his brother's ""unique talent"" and ""warm heart."" After the service, Gibb's body was taken to the town cemetery for a private burial. Gibb, who was 62, died on May 20 after a long battle with cancer. He was a member of the Bee Gees, one of the most successful pop groups of all time. The group sold over 200 million records worldwide and had a string of hits, including ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""How Deep Is Your Love,"" and ""Night Fever."" Gibb was born on the Isle of Man in 1949. He moved to Australia with his family when he was a child, and the Bee Gees were formed in 1958. The group moved to England in the early 1960s, and their career took off after they were discovered by Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles. The Bee Gees had their first major hit in 1967 with the song ""Massachusetts."" They went on to have a string of hits in the 1970s, including ""Stayin' Alive,"" which was featured in the film ""Saturday Night Fever."" Gibb was also a successful solo artist. He released a number of albums, including ""Robin's Reign"" (1983) and ""Secret Agent"" (1984). Gibb was diagnosed with cancer in 2010. He underwent treatment, but the cancer returned in 2012. Gibb died on May 20, 2012, at the age of 62. Gibb was a talented singer, songwriter, and musician. He was a member of one of the most successful pop groups of all time.

More than one in 10 providing unpaid care,"Figures from 2011 show that the largest increase was in unpaid carers working for 50 or more hours a week. Their numbers rose by 14% to more than 500,000, accounting for 14% of all unpaid carers. The number of people providing unpaid care for more than 20 hours a week also increased - up by 200,000 since 2001 to 2.1 million. Those providing unpaid care for more than 50 hours a week were more likely to be female (64%), and the majority were aged between 45 and 64. The increase in the number of people providing unpaid care is thought to be due to a number of factors, including the growing number of older people, and the increasing prevalence of long-term conditions such as dementia. The unpaid care provided by these individuals is essential to the UK economy, saving the government billions of pounds each year. However, it can also have a significant impact on the health and well-being of carers. Those providing unpaid care are more likely to experience physical health problems, mental health problems, and financial difficulties. They are also more likely to give up work or reduce their working hours, which can lead to a loss of income and career progression. The government has been criticized for not doing enough to support unpaid carers. There have been calls for increased financial support, more respite care and better access to health and social care services. In 2016, the government announced a new Carers' Allowance of £62.70 a week for those providing unpaid care for at least 35 hours a week. However, this is only available to those who are not in receipt of certain other benefits, and it is not enough to cover the costs of caring for someone full-time. There are a number of organizations that provide support and advice to unpaid carers, including Carers UK, Age UK, and the Alzheimer's Society. These organizations can provide information about benefits, respite care, and other services available to carers. They can also offer emotional support and practical help, such as organizing support groups and providing training for carers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians?,"Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians? By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics Editor Talks aimed at resolving the political deadlock continue at Stormont. The talks are focusing on welfare reform, finance, paramilitary activity, language, and culture. Welfare reform is a major issue for the DUP, which wants to see the introduction of a universal credit system in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, is opposed to welfare reform, arguing that it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society. Finance is another key issue. The DUP wants to see a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see more investment in public services. Paramilitary activity is also a major concern. The DUP wants to see an end to paramilitary activity, while Sinn Féin wants to see a process of demilitarization. Language and culture are also sensitive issues. The DUP wants to see the promotion of British identity in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see the promotion of Irish identity. These are just some of the thorny issues that the Stormont talks will need to address. If a deal can be reached, it will be a major breakthrough. However, if the talks fail, it will be a major setback for the peace process in Northern Ireland. Welfare reform Welfare reform is a major issue for the DUP, which wants to see the introduction of a universal credit system in Northern Ireland. Universal credit is a single payment that replaces six existing benefits. The DUP argues that universal credit will simplify the welfare system and make it fairer. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, is opposed to welfare reform, arguing that it will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society. Sinn Féin says that universal credit will lead to cuts in benefits and that it will make it more difficult for people to claim benefits. Finance Finance is another key issue. The DUP wants to see a reduction in corporation tax in Northern Ireland. Corporation tax is a tax on the profits of companies. The DUP argues that a reduction in corporation tax would make Northern Ireland more attractive to businesses and would create jobs. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, wants to see more investment in public services. Sinn Féin says that public services are essential for the well-being of society and that they should be properly funded. Paramilitary activity Paramilitary activity is also a major concern. The DUP wants to see an end to paramilitary activity, while Sinn Féin wants to see a process of demilitarization. The DUP argues that paramilitary activity is a threat to the peace process and that it needs to be stopped. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, argues that paramilitaries are a legitimate part of the republican struggle and that they will only disarm when there is a united Ireland. Language and culture Language and culture are also sensitive issues. The DUP wants to see the promotion of British identity in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Féin wants to see the promotion of Irish identity. The DUP argues that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and that British identity should be promoted. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, argues that Northern Ireland is a distinct entity with its own unique culture and identity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning,"Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning The UK's largest building firm said it expected a shortfall in its UK construction unit, meaning 2014 group pre-tax profits would be ""significantly lower"" than expected. Balfour said group revenue for 2014 was about £8bn - up 12% on the previous year. However, it had been hit by ""unforeseen losses"" at its UK construction business, the group said. Chief executive Andrew McNaughton said: ""Today's results are not acceptable and we have immediately begun a comprehensive review of our UK construction business. ""In the meantime we will continue to focus on our international operations and other strong parts of the group to ensure we deliver on our commitments to clients, employees and shareholders."" Shares in the firm fell by 14% on Monday morning. Balfour Beatty has been in talks with its banks about its financial position. It said it was also considering job cuts as it seeks to cut costs. Analysts said the profit warning was a ""big blow"" to Balfour Beatty. ""The company has been struggling for some time and this is another setback,"" said Liberum analyst Joe Brent. ""The UK construction market is tough and Balfour Beatty is not the only company to be struggling. But this is still a big blow."" Balfour Beatty is one of the UK's largest construction companies. It is best known for building Heathrow Terminal 5, the new Wembley Stadium and Terminal 2 at London's Gatwick Airport. The company has been hit by a number of problems in recent years, including a dispute over a school building project in Edinburgh and delays to a major rail project in the Midlands.

Sea lice and disease behind Marine Harvest bid to save £44m,"By Douglas Fraser Business/economy editor, Scotland In Scotland, the company plunged to a 4.5m euro (£4m) loss in the final three months of 2019. It blamed the outbreak of a parasite and a virus, which led to 4.8 million fish dying last year. The loss was the first for Marine Harvest in Scotland since 2009. The company said it would cut jobs and reduce the amount of antibiotics it uses. The outbreak of sea lice, which are small crustaceans that can attach themselves to fish, was the main factor behind the losses. The company had to transfer fish to other sites to try to control the spread of the parasite. The virus, which causes a disease called infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), was also a major problem. ISA is a highly contagious disease that can kill up to 80% of farmed salmon. The losses have led Marine Harvest to announce a £44m investment plan to try to improve the health of its fish. The plan includes the installation of new equipment to control sea lice and the use of new vaccines to protect fish from ISA. The company also said it would cut the number of fish it farms in Scotland by 10%. This will reduce the pressure on the environment and help to control the spread of disease. Marine Harvest is the world's largest salmon farmer. It has been operating in Scotland for more than 30 years and employs around 1,300 people. The company's losses have raised concerns about the future of the Scottish salmon farming industry. The industry is worth around £2bn a year and employs around 12,000 people. However, the industry has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, including rising costs and competition from other countries. The outbreak of sea lice and ISA has added to these challenges. The Scottish government has said it is committed to supporting the salmon farming industry. The government has provided funding for research into sea lice and ISA and has introduced new regulations to try to control the spread of disease. However, the industry is still facing a number of challenges and it is unclear whether Marine Harvest's investment plan will be enough to save the company from further losses.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Myanmar coup: India asked to return police officers who crossed border,"Indian officials said the officers and their families had crossed the border in recent days. In a letter, Myanmar authorities asked for their return ""in order to uphold friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries"". The development follows last month's coup in Myanmar, which has been widely condemned by the international community. The military has detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other top officials, and has imposed martial law in parts of the country. The Indian government has not yet responded to Myanmar's request, but it is facing pressure from both within India and from the international community to take action. Some Indian lawmakers have called on the government to grant asylum to the police officers and their families, while others have said that they should be returned to Myanmar. The United States and the United Kingdom have both called on India to respect the rule of law and to uphold its international obligations. The situation is a delicate one for India, which has close ties to both Myanmar and the United States. India has been a major supporter of Myanmar's democratic transition, but it is also concerned about the stability of the country, which shares a long border with India. India is also facing pressure from China, which has backed the military coup in Myanmar. China has significant economic and strategic interests in Myanmar, and it is likely to try to influence India's response to the crisis. The Indian government is likely to take its time in deciding how to respond to Myanmar's request. It will need to weigh the various factors involved, including the domestic political situation, its relations with Myanmar and the United States, and the potential for regional instability. Whatever decision India makes, it is likely to have a significant impact on the future of Myanmar and the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Chagos legal status sent to international court by UN,"The UN General Assembly voted by 94 countries to 15 that The Hague should examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands. The former British colony was a naval base and home to 1,500 people before they were forced out in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for an American military base on the main island of Diego Garcia. The UK maintains that the islands have always been part of British territory and that the islanders were not permanent residents. Mauritius argues that the islands were part of its territory when it gained independence from Britain in 1968 and that the islanders were forcibly removed. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will now consider whether the Chagos Islands were legally separated from Mauritius in 1965 and whether the UK has an obligation to return them. The UK government has said that it will not abide by the ICJ's ruling if it goes against the UK's position. The US government has also said that it will not withdraw its military base from Diego Garcia. The Chagossians, who now live in Mauritius, the UK, and the Seychelles, have welcomed the decision to refer the case to the ICJ. They hope that the court will rule in their favor and that they will be able to return home. The Chagos Islands dispute is a complex and long-running issue. The ICJ's ruling could have a significant impact on the future of the islands and their people. In addition to the legal arguments, the case also involves issues of human rights and self-determination. The Chagossians were forcibly removed from their homes and have been living in exile for decades. They have been denied the right to return to their homeland and have been subjected to discrimination and abuse. The ICJ's ruling could help to address these human rights concerns and could contribute to the resolution of the Chagos Islands dispute.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Covid: Moray moving to level two 'hugely welcome',"The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate. However it has dropped in recent days, to under 40 cases per 100,000 people - below the level two threshold. The move means that pubs and restaurants will be able to serve alcohol indoors until 10pm, and up to eight people from four households can meet in homes and gardens. Moray's MSP, Richard Lochhead, said the move was ""hugely welcome"" news for businesses and residents. He said: ""This is a result of the hard work and sacrifices made by people across Moray in recent weeks. ""It's important to remember that the virus is still here, so we must all continue to follow the guidance and protect each other."" Moray Council's leader, Graham Leadbitter, said the move was a ""significant step forward"" for the region.

Microsoft seeks to clean up Xbox game chat with AI,"It is introducing customisable filters that let gamers choose the vocabulary they see in messages from friends and rival players. The four levels of filtering range from child-friendly through to entirely unfiltered.  The new feature builds on Microsoft’s existing approach to Xbox chat moderation, which saw it remove 2.3 million abusive messages between July and September last year, and take action on more than 4.6 million accounts.  Xbox’s new chat filter arrives at a time when online toxicity is becoming an increasingly prominent issue, with many games suffering from severe levels of harassment and abuse. The problem has become so bad in some titles that players have started to boycott matches if they involve certain maps or game modes, due to the fear of encountering particularly nasty opponents.  In one of the most notorious recent examples, Valve was forced to remove a popular community-created map from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive after it emerged that the map’s creator had left a series of racist easter eggs hidden within it.  Microsoft is at least one of several major players in the games industry attempting to tackle the problem, with Sony and Nintendo also taking steps to reduce toxicity on their own platforms. In November last year, Sony rolled out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that allowed players to mute messages from specific individuals or groups, while Nintendo has been working with researchers at Kyoto University to develop an AI capable of detecting and filtering out abusive messages in real time.  However, despite the efforts of major platform holders, online toxicity remains a significant problem in gaming. There have been particular concerns expressed about its impact on marginalised groups, such as women and players from minority backgrounds.  In theory, customisable chat filters – especially ones that give players the option of completely disabling text communication – could offer an effective way to address these concerns. However, they also raise the potential for players to abuse the system by blocking legitimate criticism or commentary.  Microsoft is hoping to strike a balance between protecting players from abuse and giving them the freedom to have unfiltered discussions with friends. Whether or not it succeeds will likely depend on how well the new chat filters are implemented and enforced.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Merged Isle of Wight prison criticised in report,"An inspection of HMP Isle of Wight found ""degrading"" sanitation provision, high use of force and inmates seeking sanctuary in a segregation unit. Inspectors from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) said there was ""a failure to provide decent, safe living conditions for prisoners"". The report, published on Thursday, said the prison was ""struggling to cope"" with the merger of two institutions in 2013, which created a ""volatile"" environment. The IMB said the prison was ""still finding its feet"" after the merger and that the process had been ""difficult and disruptive"". One of the most concerning findings was the ""degrading"" state of the toilets and showers. Inspectors said that prisoners were often forced to queue for long periods of time to use the facilities, and that the showers were often cold or broken. In some cases, prisoners were forced to share toilets with up to 20 other inmates. The report also found that the use of force by staff was ""unnecessarily high"". Inspectors said that they had witnessed staff using excessive force on prisoners, including punching, kicking and headlocks. In one case, an inmate was left with a broken jaw after being restrained by staff. The IMB said that the high use of force was ""a symptom of the wider problems"" at the prison, including overcrowding, understaffing and a lack of training. The report also found that inmates were increasingly seeking sanctuary in the segregation unit, which is supposed to be used for prisoners who are at risk of harming themselves or others. However, inspectors said that the segregation unit was often being used as a ""dumping ground"" for prisoners who were difficult to manage. The IMB said that the prison needed to ""take urgent action"" to address the problems identified in the report. The board's chairman, Richard Garside, said that the prison was ""failing to provide a decent and safe environment for prisoners"". He said that the problems at the prison were ""a matter of concern"" and that the government needed to take action to address them. In response to the report, the Ministry of Justice said that it was ""committed to improving conditions at HMP Isle of Wight"". A spokesperson said that the prison was ""undergoing a significant investment program"" and that the government was ""working to address the concerns raised by the IMB"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Fears raised 'free NHS' will come to an end,"Nearly half of the 78 health and care leaders surveyed by the Nuffield Trust felt the status quo is collapsing. A third believe it is beyond repair and has already entered a terminal decline. The NHS is one of the UK's most cherished institutions, but it is facing a number of challenges, including a rising population, an aging population, and increasing demand for services. In recent years, there have been growing concerns that the NHS is no longer able to provide the level of care that patients expect. Waiting times for appointments and treatment have increased, and some patients have been forced to wait for months or even years for essential care. The Nuffield Trust survey found that many health and care leaders believe that the NHS is in a state of decline. They cite a number of factors, including the rising cost of care, the shortage of staff, and the increasing complexity of patient needs. The survey also found that many health and care leaders are concerned about the future of the NHS. They believe that the NHS is not sustainable in its current form and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The Nuffield Trust survey is a wake-up call for the government. It is clear that the NHS is facing a number of challenges and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The government has said that it is committed to the NHS and that it will provide the funding and support that it needs. However, it is clear that the NHS is facing a number of challenges and that it will need to undergo significant change if it is to meet the needs of patients in the future. The government must now work with health and care leaders to develop a plan for the future of the NHS. This plan must be based on the evidence and it must be sustainable in the long term.

The research, published in the journal Obesity, analysed genetic data from almost 400,000 people and found 148 regions of the human genome which were linked to physical activity. The study also looked at whether genes were linked to adiposity or fatness. Researchers say they identified approximately 400 genetic areas associated with obesity or adiposity. It was found that physical inactivity and fatness tended to share some genetic causes. Some of the genes associated with physical inactivity were found to be linked to depression and schizophrenia. The Aberdeen team say they believe that when combined with data on other factors, such as diet and environment, the genetic insights could be used to better predict the likelihood of a person being less active. ""In terms of identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of being inactive and obese, then knowing something about their genetic predisposition would allow interventions to be implemented at a younger age,"" said Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, one of the authors of the paper. ""In large-scale population studies, the genetic data gathered from each individual could be used to calculate a risk score for inactivity and obesity. This score could then be used to target resources to those more likely to benefit from an intervention."" The team also believe that learning more about the genetic causes of physical inactivity could help in the development of new drugs designed to overcome the lack of motivation to exercise. ""Physical inactivity remains one of the most pressing public health concerns of the 21st century,"" said Professor Stamatakis. ""Overcoming physical inactivity is a complex issue as it is influenced by a wide range of factors, including genetic, physiological, psychological, environmental, and socio-economic determinants.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Poster wars breaking out across Europe,"In Britain, the UK Independence Party has certainly got the publicity it was hoping for from its new anti-immigration posters. They have been widely condemned, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling them ""divisive and offensive"". But the party's leader, Nigel Farage, has defended them, saying they are ""a wake-up call"" about the dangers of mass immigration. The posters, which feature an image of a long queue of people outside a job centre, with the slogan ""Breaking Point: The EU has failed us"", have been placed on billboards across the country. They have sparked a furious debate about immigration, with some people supporting the message while others have condemned it as racist. The row over the posters has also spread to other European countries. In Germany, the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) has put up posters that show a Muslim woman in a burka with the slogan ""Stop Islamisation"". The posters have been widely condemned by politicians and community leaders, who say they are Islamophobic. In France, the far-right National Front party has put up posters that show a picture of a black man with the slogan ""No to immigration"". The posters have also been widely condemned, with many people saying that they are racist. The rise of anti-immigration rhetoric across Europe is a worrying trend. It is a sign that far-right parties are gaining ground and that they are exploiting people's fears about immigration. This is a dangerous development that could lead to social unrest and even violence. It is important to remember that immigration is a complex issue with no easy answers. It is important to have a balanced debate about immigration, and to focus on the facts rather than on fear and prejudice. One of the most important facts about immigration is that it is not a threat to our way of life. In fact, immigrants often make a positive contribution to our economy and our society. They bring new skills and talents, and they help to create new businesses and jobs. It is also important to remember that immigration is a human issue. Behind every statistic, there is a person with a story to tell. We need to remember that immigrants are people just like us, and that they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Viagogo threatened with fresh court action,"By Simon Read Personal finance reporter The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took Viagogo to court last year for breaking consumer protection law. The ticket seller was given a deadline of February 16 to comply with the order, but the CMA says it has not done so. The CMA is now seeking a court order to force Viagogo to comply, and is also considering additional enforcement action. A spokesperson for the CMA said: ""We are extremely disappointed that Viagogo has failed to improve its practices and comply with the order that we secured last year. ""We will not hesitate to take further action to protect consumers and ensure that competition in the secondary ticketing market remains fair."" Viagogo has said that it is ""committed to complying with the law and the CMA's order"". A spokesperson for the company said: ""We have been working hard to implement the changes required by the CMA, and we are confident that we will be able to comply with the order in full by the end of March."" The CMA's investigation found that Viagogo had broken the law by: Failing to provide accurate information about the tickets it sells, including the price, the location of the seats, and the availability of tickets. Charging hidden fees that were not clearly disclosed to customers. Making it difficult for customers to get a refund if they could not attend an event. The CMA's order requires Viagogo to: Provide clear and accurate information about the tickets it sells. Disclose all fees and charges to customers upfront. Make it easier for customers to get a refund if they cannot attend an event. The CMA's action against Viagogo is part of a wider crackdown on the secondary ticketing market. In 2018, the government introduced new legislation to regulate the secondary ticketing market. The legislation gives the CMA powers to investigate and take enforcement action against ticket sellers who break the law. The CMA has also been working with other regulators in Europe to tackle the issue of online ticket touts. In 2019, the CMA and the European Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on the enforcement of consumer protection law in the secondary ticketing market. The CMA's action against Viagogo is a significant step towards ensuring that the secondary ticketing market is fair and transparent for consumers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

NHS contaminated blood scandal victims urged to come forward,"Thousands of people were infected with HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood after blood transfusions and other treatments. After 30 years of repeated calls, Parliament will announce the terms of reference for the public inquiry. The inquiry will investigate how the infections happened, why they were not discovered sooner, and what lessons can be learned to prevent similar tragedies in the future. It will also consider the impact on the victims and their families, and whether they have received adequate support. The announcement of the inquiry is a major victory for campaigners who have been fighting for justice for decades. They say that the victims have been let down by the government and the NHS, and that the inquiry is long overdue. Jason Evans, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said: ""This is a historic day for people affected by the contaminated blood scandal. For 30 years, they have been fighting for truth and justice, and today's announcement is a major step forward."" Sue Threakall, co-founder of the Campaign for Contaminated Blood Justice, said: ""This is a day we have been waiting for for a long time. We are delighted that the government has finally agreed to hold a public inquiry, and we will continue to fight for justice for all those affected by this scandal."" The inquiry is expected to take several years to complete. It will be led by a panel of independent experts, and will hear evidence from victims, their families, and healthcare professionals. The government has said that it is committed to learning the lessons from the contaminated blood scandal, and that it will take action to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. In addition to the public inquiry, the government has also announced a compensation scheme for victims of the scandal. The scheme will provide payments to those who were infected with HIV or hepatitis C, and to their families. The compensation scheme is a welcome step forward, but campaigners say that it does not go far enough. They say that the government should also provide long-term support for victims, including access to healthcare and financial assistance. The contaminated blood scandal is one of the biggest medical scandals in British history. It is a tragedy that has caused immeasurable suffering for thousands of people. The public inquiry is a vital step towards ensuring that the victims get the justice they deserve.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Julia Gillard grilled on Rudd ousting 'victory speech',"Ms Gillard, who took office in June 2010, had said she took the decision to challenge Mr Rudd on the day itself. But an ABC news programme suggested that preparations for a leadership challenge had already begun weeks earlier. On 24 June 2010, Gillard called a press conference to announce that she would challenge Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party. In her speech, Gillard said that she had made the decision to challenge Rudd that day, and that she believed that she was the best person to lead the party and the country. However, an ABC news programme on 26 June 2010, reported that Gillard had begun making preparations for a leadership challenge several weeks earlier. The program reported that Gillard had met with several senior Labor figures in the weeks leading up to the challenge, and that she had discussed the possibility of challenging Rudd with them. The report also said that Gillard had sought advice from former Prime Minister Bob Hawke on how to challenge a sitting Prime Minister. Hawke had been successful in challenging Bill Hayden for the leadership of the Labor Party in 1983. The report suggested that Gillard's decision to challenge Rudd had been planned in advance, and that she had been preparing for the challenge for several weeks. Gillard denied the allegations, saying that she had only made the decision to challenge Rudd on the day itself. The ABC report has raised questions about Gillard's version of events. If the report is accurate, it suggests that Gillard was not as spontaneous in her decision to challenge Rudd as she has claimed. It also suggests that Gillard may have been planning the challenge for some time, and that she may have been disloyal to Rudd. The allegations against Gillard have damaged her reputation, and they have raised questions about her leadership. Gillard has denied the allegations, but they have cast a shadow over her time as Prime Minister.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Search under way for monkeys missing from Belfast zoo,"Six lion-tailed macaques managed to get out on Monday - four have since been returned. The other two monkeys have been seen in the grounds or near the zoo. Belfast zoo said it was working with the PSNI and Belfast City Council to try and locate the remaining animals. The search continues. The lion-tailed macaques are part of a group of six that arrived at Belfast Zoo in April 2022 from Germany. They are an endangered species, native to the Western Ghats of India. In the wild, lion-tailed macaques live in social groups of up to 50 individuals, and they are known for their long tails and black fur. One of the missing monkeys, a female, was spotted on Wednesday morning in the grounds of Belfast Zoo. The other missing monkey, a male, was last seen on Monday evening near the zoo. Belfast Zoo staff are asking members of the public to keep an eye out for the missing monkeys and to report any sightings to the zoo. The zoo is also asking people not to approach the monkeys, as they may be frightened or aggressive. Lion-tailed macaques are not native to the UK, and they are not considered to be a danger to the public. However, they are wild animals, and they can be unpredictable. If you see one of the missing monkeys, please do not approach it. Instead, please call the Belfast Zoo on 028 9077 6277. The PSNI is also asking members of the public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity in the area around the zoo. The search for the missing monkeys is ongoing, and the zoo is hopeful that they will be found safe and well.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: UK foreign aid spending cut by £2.9bn amid economic downturn,"It said a review of aid projects has prioritised the most vulnerable countries for assistance. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would still meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on international development. He added: ""The UK will remain a world-leading donor and continue to tackle extreme poverty, help the world's most vulnerable people, fight disease and tackle climate change, and respond to humanitarian emergencies around the world."" The decision has been criticised by some aid agencies, who say it will have a ""devastating"" impact on the world's poorest people. Oxfam's head of UK government relations, Ruth Tanner, said: ""This is a devastating blow to the world's poorest people. It will cost lives, push people deeper into poverty and undermine years of progress."" Save the Children UK's chief executive, Kevin Watkins, said: ""The UK government has made a shameful decision to cut foreign aid at a time when the global community needs it more than ever. This cut will hit the world's poorest and most vulnerable people the hardest, costing lives and pushing millions more into poverty."" The UK government has defended the decision, saying it is necessary to ""balance the books"" after the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. International Development Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ""We recognise the vital role that UK aid plays in helping to lift people out of poverty and providing essential support in humanitarian crises."" She added: ""However, we must balance this with our own fiscal responsibilities and the need to reduce the UK's borrowing. We will continue to deliver our aid commitments in the most effective and efficient way possible."" The decision will see the UK's aid budget fall to £12.2bn in 2021-22, from £15.1bn in 2020-21.

Rooney mania grips Tanzania as Everton play Gor Mahia,"Rooney had the first touch of the game between Everton and Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia, in front of the largest crowd ever seen at the National Stadium in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. This was a pre-season friendly match, and Rooney's introduction to the proceedings was met with a huge roar and applause by the fervent Tanzanian crowd. The former England international is used to such adulation, but the outpouring of affection for him in this East African nation was something else. Rooney's every touch of the ball was greeted with cheers, and the crowd even chanted his name throughout the game. The 33-year-old forward responded with a lively performance, creating several chances for his team-mates and scoring a stunning goal from a free-kick. Everton manager Marco Silva was delighted with Rooney's performance, saying: ""He's a world-class player, and he showed his quality today. He's still got a lot to offer, and I'm sure he'll be a valuable asset to us this season."" Rooney's performance was all the more impressive considering that he had only joined Everton a few weeks ago. He has yet to reach full fitness, but he showed glimpses of the quality that made him one of the most feared strikers in the world. The match itself was a closely contested affair, with Everton eventually winning 2-1. However, the result was secondary to the spectacle of Rooney playing in front of such an appreciative crowd. For the Tanzanian fans, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. They had the chance to see one of the greatest players of his generation up close, and they lapped it up. Rooney mania had gripped Tanzania, and it was a sight to behold. The match was also a success for Gor Mahia, who showed that they can compete with some of the best teams in Africa. The Kenyan champions gave Everton a good run for their money, and they will be confident of making an impact in the Caf Champions League this season. Overall, the match was a great advert for African football. It showed that the continent has some of the most passionate fans in the world, and that it can produce players of the highest quality. Rooney's presence in Tanzania was a reminder of the global appeal of the game, and it is sure to inspire a new generation of African footballers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ants use Sun and memories to navigate,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Scientists say they can follow a compass route, regardless of the direction in which they are facing. It is the equivalent of blindfolded humans finding their way out of a maze, except the ants are navigating a jungle. When ants forage for food they use the sun as a navigational reference, and it was thought that they could only follow a compass route when the sun was out. But researchers have shown that ants can also store the sun's position in their memories, enabling them to navigate accurately even when the sky is overcast. Dr Antoine Wystrach, who led the study and is now at Cornell University, US, said: ""They know where the sun is even if they can't see it."" The experiments, which were performed by a team at the University of Edinburgh, involved training wood ants to associate a particular compass direction (in their case, west) with a food source. The ants were then taken into a featureless arena, which was either lit from above or below so that they could not see any visual cues from the sun or sky. ""We expected that when we placed them down in the arena they would become disoriented and just wander around,"" said Dr Wystrach. ""But within a couple of minutes they started to walk in a particular direction, and they kept doing it. It was a clear indication that they were using sun compass information that they had stored in their memory."" Dr Wystrach and his colleagues then showed that the ants could still navigate accurately after a period of time in the dark - indicating that they could remember the sun's position even after an extended period without exposure to it. The researchers say that their findings could help to improve the navigation systems in robots and other artificial systems. Dr Wystrach said: ""Ants are able to use very limited amounts of information to navigate, and they do this in very complex environments. ""If we can understand how they do this, then we can use this information to design better navigation systems for robots.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lifespan gap 'widening between rich and poor',"By Judith Burns BBC News Everyone is living longer but rich people's lives are extending faster, the City University London study says. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century but this trend reversed for men in the 1980s and for women in the late 1990s. The authors say these trends are ""unlikely to improve anytime soon"". The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, looked at data from the National Health Service (NHS) for England on more than 190,000 people over a 40-year period. It found that the life expectancy of men and women has increased substantially since 1970. In 1970, a woman born in the most deprived areas could typically expect to live until just after her 71st birthday. By 2010, this had risen to just under 81. But she could still expect to die six years earlier than a baby girl born in the most affluent area. For men, the gap was wider still. In 1970, a baby boy in the most deprived areas could expect to live until he was just 65, compared with nearly 72 in the most affluent areas. By 2010, men in the most deprived areas could expect to live to 76, but this was still four years fewer than those in the most affluent areas. The researchers say the gap between rich and poor is particularly wide around the age of 60. In 2010, a 60-year-old woman living in the most deprived area of England could expect to live another 22 years, compared with 27 years for a woman in the most affluent area. For men, a similar gap exists. A 60-year-old man living in one of the most deprived areas could expect to live nearly 19 years longer, compared with 23 years for a man in the most affluent area. The authors say the widening gap between rich and poor is due to a number of factors, including differences in lifestyle, diet and access to healthcare. They say it is unlikely to improve anytime soon, as the same factors are continuing to affect people's life expectancies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'fake' painting revealed,"Since February, Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th Century work 'Young Woman' has been replaced by a $120 (£70) counterfeit, produced in China. The discovery was made after a visitor to the gallery spotted a discrepancy between the original and its supposed replacement. Upon closer examination, experts discovered that the brushstrokes were less refined, the colors were less vibrant, and the canvas was thinner than the original. The paint used in the counterfeit was also found to be of a lower quality. The Dulwich Picture Gallery has since removed the fake painting from display and is working with the police to investigate how the counterfeit came to be in its possession. It is believed that the original was stolen sometime in the past year and replaced with the fake. The gallery's director, Xavier Bray, said: ""This is a very serious matter. We are doing everything we can to find out how this happened and to ensure that it does not happen again."" The discovery of the fake painting has raised concerns about the security of art galleries and the authenticity of the artworks they display. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of fake paintings being sold to collectors and museums. In 2017, Sotheby's auction house sold a fake painting attributed to the Dutch artist Frans Hals for $10 million. The painting was later found to be a forgery, and Sotheby's was forced to refund the buyer. In 2018, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam discovered that a painting attributed to the Italian artist Caravaggio was a fake. The painting had been on display at the museum for over 200 years. The Dulwich Picture Gallery is one of the oldest public art galleries in the world. It was founded in 1811 and houses a collection of over 600 paintings. The gallery is a popular tourist destination and attracts over 300,000 visitors each year. The discovery of the fake painting has been a shock to the gallery's staff and visitors. It is hoped that the investigation will shed light on how the counterfeit came to be in the gallery's possession and will help to prevent similar incidents in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Kronospan Chirk biomass plans vote deferred for site visit,"Kronospan says the plant would provide renewable energy for its wood panel factory at Chirk and help secure 600 jobs. Opponents say the plant would harm the local environment and increase traffic. The company, which has already invested £200m in its Chirk site, said a decision on the application was likely to be made in the autumn. ""We hope the additional information we provide as part of the site visit will help councillors reach an informed decision on an application which is so important for the future of our factory and the wider community,"" said Kronospan UK managing director Ronnie Hanna. Chirk North councillor Terry Evans, who called for the deferral of the decision, said: ""I think a site visit is crucial in the determination of this application. ""At the moment members only have a desk-top view of the site and the proposed development."" The company is seeking planning permission to build the plant next to its existing factory at Rhosymedre, near Chirk, on the border of Wrexham and Shropshire. The energy-from-waste plant would generate electricity using wood waste from the factory's production processes. The plans include installing a 39-metre high stack to release emissions from the combustion process. But opponents claim the plant would release harmful pollutants and increase traffic in the area. The proposal has attracted more than 1,400 objections from people living nearby. The campaign group Chirk Against Incinerator said the site visit would allow councillors to ""see first-hand the unsuitability of the location"". ""It's great news that we have been successful in our request for a site visit,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Piercy. ""We are determined to ensure that the full impact of this ill-conceived proposal is exposed before any decision is made.""

Iraqi security forces 'abuse female prisoners',"Many were held for months or even years without charge, the report found. Interrogators often questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than the crimes they were supposed to have committed. The Iraqi government has denied the allegations of sexual abuse, saying they are ""unfounded and politically motivated."" However, the BBC has spoken to several women who say they were held in secret detention centers and subjected to physical and sexual abuse. ""They beat me with a stick on my arms and legs,"" said one woman, who asked not to be named. ""They then put me in a cell with three other women. We were all naked."" The woman said she was held in the Abu Ghraib prison for six months without charge. She said she was repeatedly interrogated about her husband, who was a member of the Iraqi army. ""They wanted to know where he was and what he was doing,"" she said. ""They threatened to kill me if I didn't tell them."" Another woman, who was held in a secret detention center in Baghdad, said she was raped by a guard. ""I was so scared,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do."" The woman said she was held for three months without charge. She said she was never told why she was being held. The BBC has also obtained documents that show that the Iraqi government knew about the allegations of sexual abuse. In a 2005 memo, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior acknowledged that there had been ""credible reports"" of sexual abuse of female prisoners. The memo said that the ministry was investigating the allegations and would take ""appropriate action"" against any perpetrators. However, the ministry has not released any information about the results of its investigation. The allegations of sexual abuse of female prisoners in Iraq are a serious human rights concern.

The climber who bagged all 282 Munros in one winter,"By Linda Sinclair BBC Scotland News Kevin Woods, from Glasgow, is believed to be only the third person to have achieved the feat in a winter season following in the footsteps of Sir Chris Bonington and Donald Bennet. The self-employed landscape gardener completed his marathon challenge on Monday on the remote Slioch in Torridon. He told BBC Scotland: ""I feel elated. It is a feeling of relief and joy. I have worked for five years to get to this point. To complete it is amazing. ""I have been out in some horrendous conditions. I have been blown over by winds and had snow in my eyes, but it has all been worth it. ""I was 200m from the summit of Slioch when I completed the challenge. It was a great feeling although I admit the last two Munros were really hard work."" The 40-year-old began his quest to climb all 282 Munros - mountains in Scotland over 3,000ft - in the winter of 2018. He had initially aimed to complete the challenge in two years but due to bad weather and injury scaled that back to five years. He is believed to be only the 16th person ever to have climbed all 282 Munros in winter. Mr Woods said his achievement would not have been possible without the support of his wife Lorna and other supporters. ""I couldn't have done it without them,"" he said. ""I have been away from home so much and they have picked up the slack. ""I have met some great people on the Munros and made some very good friends."" The landscape gardener said he still hasn't decided what his next challenge will be but said he could not rule out completing the Munros in summer as well.

Abellio Greater Anglia rail firm faces franchise challenge,"Abellio Greater Anglia currently runs the East Anglia franchise, but it is being re-let in October 2016. It includes services to Stansted Airport and to Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex. The rail franchise is being relet because a new specification was drawn up by the Department of Transport and in order to bid for the franchise, companies had to show how they would meet this specification. Abellio has reportedly failed to meet some of the requirements and, as a result, its bid has been put in doubt. The new franchise will be awarded to the company that can meet the new specification and provide the best value for money for passengers. Abellio Greater Anglia has said that it is ""disappointed"" by the decision and that it will be ""considering its options."" However, the Department for Transport has said that it is ""confident"" that the new franchise will be awarded to a company that can meet the new specification and provide the best value for money for passengers. The re-letting of the East Anglia franchise is part of a wider plan by the government to improve the UK's rail network. The government has said that it wants to see more competition on the railways and that it wants to see more investment in new trains and infrastructure.

Scrap dealer law aims to reduce metal theft,"All scrap dealers and motor salvage operators in England and Wales must now apply for a licence from their local authority and keep records on every transaction involving scrap metal. The new law, which came into force on 1 October 2013, is aimed at reducing metal theft, which costs the UK economy an estimated £770m a year. Under the new law, scrap dealers must keep a record of the following information for each transaction: The name and address of the seller The type and quantity of scrap metal sold The date of the transaction The price paid for the scrap metal The method of payment Scrap dealers must also keep a record of all waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) that they receive. This information must be kept for a period of three years and must be made available to the police or other authorised officers on request. Failure to comply with the new law could result in a fine of up to £5,000. The new law is part of a wider government crackdown on metal theft. In 2012, the government introduced a new offence of ""going equipped to steal metal"", which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The government has also increased the number of police officers dedicated to tackling metal theft. In 2013, the government announced that it would be investing £5m in new technology to help police officers catch metal thieves. The new law has been welcomed by the scrap metal industry. The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) said that the law would help to ""legitimise"" the scrap metal industry and make it more difficult for criminals to operate. The BMRA said that the law would also help to reduce the amount of metal theft, which has a negative impact on the environment. Metal theft can lead to pollution and damage to property. The new law is a significant step forward in the fight against metal theft.

It comes after Sheffield-based cancer charity Weston Park Hospital Cancer Charity closed its shops. The closure means the charity is losing out on over £30,000 a month. To make up for this shortfall, the hospice is promoting the #LetsPledge campaign, which aims to replace the income lost by people pledging the cost of an item they would have bought from a charity shop. Rob Wilson, the hospice's chief executive, said: ""We need to keep our fundraising going, because if we don't, we won't be here to care for the children and families who need us. ""There are so many ways to pledge, from setting up a monthly direct debit to donating the cost of a cup of coffee or a slice of cake. Every penny helps."" The hospice is also launching a new online shop, where people can buy items that have been donated to the charity. The shop will sell a range of items, including clothes, books, and toys. Mr. Wilson said: ""Our online shop is a great way to support the hospice and find unique items at the same time. We would encourage everyone to have a look and see what they can find."" Other hospices around the country are also feeling the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. St. Luke's Hospice in Sheffield has lost over £100,000 in income due to the closure of its shops and the cancellation of its fundraising events. The hospice's chief executive, David Whiting, said: ""This is a very difficult time for hospices. We are losing out on vital income at a time when our services are needed more than ever. ""We want to thank everyone who has supported us so far. Your donations are making a real difference to the lives of our patients and their families."" Hospices provide essential care for people with life-limiting illnesses. They offer a range of services, including pain management, symptom control, and support for families. The coronavirus pandemic has put a strain on the finances of many hospices. However, the hospices are determined to continue providing their vital services. They are calling on the public to support them in any way they can.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sixth forms in England given £91m cash injection,"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter The cash injection of £91m includes £57.4m for sixth form colleges for building needs and £30m for school and college places for 16 to 19-year-olds. A further £3.9m maintenance grant will given direct to 24 councils in England to replace school sixth forms with sixth form colleges. The government says the funding will provide 20,000 new sixth form places by 2025-26 and 30,000 new technical education places by 2024-25, including a £21m investment in new T-level classrooms. It will also part-fund the £450m expansion of the University of Suffolk. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the investment will create ""high-quality training environments"" for young people and ""ensure businesses have the skilled workforce they need"". But Labour said the announcement was ""nothing more than a drop in the ocean"" for England's ""underfunded schools and colleges"". The National Education Union (NEU) said the government is ""simply papering over the cracks"". Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said, ""The injection of capital funding does not solve the chronic underfunding of post-16 education in England. Imagine the impact on young people's life chances if this level of funding was available every year for the next 10 years."" The announcement comes amid a wider review of post-16 qualifications, including A-levels and T-levels. In December 2022, the government said it will not be making any immediate changes to A-levels. But it is considering reforms to T-levels after a report from the Education Policy Institute raised concerns about their quality. The £91m cash injection is part of a £1.6bn investment in skills and further education announced in the autumn statement. The government says this investment will help to ""level up"" skills and boost the economy. But shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government's record on education is ""nothing short of a disaster"". She said, ""Schools and colleges are facing real-terms cuts, teachers are leaving the profession in droves, and young people are being left behind. This announcement is nothing more than a drop in the ocean for England's underfunded schools and colleges.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wilson Jerman: Ex-White House butler dies with coronavirus,"It was Jackie Kennedy who noticed Wilson Roosevelt Jerman while he worked as a cleaner in the White House. The then First Lady had him promoted, and he went on to become the first black man to serve as a butler in the presidential mansion. Jerman, who has died aged 91 from coronavirus, was born in the segregated South, the son of a sharecropper. He left school at 14 to help support his family. After serving in the army during World War II, he moved to Washington DC, where he worked as a waiter and a cleaner. In 1957, he was hired as a cleaner at the White House. It was not long before his quiet competence and warm personality caught the attention of Jackie Kennedy. She had him promoted to butler, and he quickly became a trusted member of the household staff. Jerman served eight presidents, from Dwight D Eisenhower to George H W Bush. He witnessed some of the most momentous events in American history, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate scandal. He was also present at many state dinners and receptions, where he served world leaders and celebrities. Jerman was a discreet and private man, but he was also proud of his role in the White House. He once said: ""I am a butler, but I am also a historian. I have seen a lot of things, and I have learned a lot of things."" Jerman retired from the White House in 1986, but he remained active in public life. He was a frequent speaker at schools and universities, where he shared his experiences of working in the White House. He also wrote a memoir, My Life in the White House: The Extraordinary Story of the First Black Butler of the White House. Jerman's death has been met with sadness by many who knew him. Former President George W Bush said: ""Wilson Jerman was a true American hero. He served his country with honor and distinction, and he made the White House a more welcoming place for all who visited."" Former First Lady Michelle Obama said: ""Wilson Jerman was a pioneer who broke down barriers and made history. He was a role model for generations of African Americans, and his legacy will continue to inspire us all."" Jerman is survived by his wife, Doris, and their three children.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
North Korean man caught by South after crossing border,"The man, in his 20s, was wearing a diving suit and a set of fins when he was stopped in the de-militarized zone (DMZ), South Korea said. He is thought to be seeking asylum in the South. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas, with Pyongyang ramping up its missile tests and threatening to resume nuclear testing. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the man was caught in the eastern part of the DMZ shortly before midnight on Saturday. He was carrying a pair of scissors, a flashlight and some dried squid. The man told South Korean authorities that he had defected from North Korea on Friday night by swimming across the Han River, which forms part of the border between the two countries. He then walked for several hours before reaching the DMZ. The man's account of his defection is being investigated by South Korean authorities. If confirmed, he would be the first person to successfully defect from North Korea to the South by swimming across the Han River since 2019. The incident highlights the perilous journey that North Koreans face when trying to escape the repressive regime in their country. Many risk their lives by crossing the heavily fortified DMZ, which is patrolled by armed guards from both sides. The number of North Korean defectors to the South has declined in recent years, as Pyongyang has tightened border security and cracked down on defectors. However, there has been a slight increase in defections in recent months, possibly due to the worsening economic situation in North Korea. South Korea has welcomed the defector and said it will provide him with protection and support. The man is expected to be transferred to a South Korean government facility where he will be interviewed and processed. The incident is likely to further strain relations between North and South Korea, which have been on a downward spiral since the collapse of a nuclear summit between the two leaders in 2019.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Colombia offers reward after eight young partygoers killed,"Four gunmen burst into a party held at a house in Samaniego on Saturday and shot dead seven men and one woman. The victims were part of a group of about 20 revellers. The motive for the attack is still unclear, but police are investigating whether it was related to a local drug gang. The incident has shocked the community in Samaniego, which is located in the south-western Colombian department of Nariño. Nariño is one of Colombia's most violent departments, with a high rate of drug-related crime. In recent years, there has been an increase in violence in the region, as rival drug gangs battle for control of the lucrative cocaine trade. The Colombian government has offered a reward of up to 100 million pesos ($33,000) for information leading to the capture of the gunmen responsible for the attack. President Iván Duque has condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""This cowardly and heinous crime will not go unpunished,"" Duque said in a statement. ""We will continue to fight against drug trafficking and violence in all its forms."" The attack in Samaniego is the latest in a series of violent incidents that have taken place in Colombia in recent months. In January, at least 20 people were killed in a car bomb attack in the city of Cúcuta. And in March, at least 10 people were killed in a shooting at a bar in the city of Cali. The violence in Colombia is a major concern for the government, which is struggling to contain the drug trade and other forms of organised crime.

Rosemary Dinch, 71, and her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, both from Swanage, know no more than the rest of the community about her whereabouts, their lawyer said. Dinch is said to have helped search for Gaia after she went missing, while Elsey is believed to have been one of the last people to see her. Police have said they are keeping an open mind about Gaia's disappearance and are not ruling out the possibility that she may have come to harm. In a statement issued through their lawyer, Dinch and Elsey said: ""We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Gaia's disappearance. ""We have been doing everything we can to help the police with their inquiries and we will continue to do so. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Gaia's family and friends at this difficult time."" The pair were arrested on suspicion of murder on 19 November and have been released on bail. Gaia's disappearance has sparked a major search operation, involving police, coastguard and volunteers. Searches have been carried out across Dorset, including in Swanage, Langton Matravers and Studland. Police have also been searching the coastline and the sea. Gaia's family have appealed for information about her whereabouts. In a statement, they said: ""We are desperate for any information that will help us find Gaia.

US nuclear fears block Intel China supercomputer update,"Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce, which oversees exports, declined the request citing concerns that the update could benefit China's military. Intel said it was disappointed and that the decision would slow the development of artificial intelligence in the US. The company said it would continue to work with the US government to address concerns. The US has expressed concerns about China's rapidly developing artificial intelligence capabilities. In 2019, the US added several Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, citing concerns that they were developing artificial intelligence for military purposes. The US is not the only country with concerns about China's artificial intelligence capabilities. In 2018, the European Union called on China to develop ethical guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence. The US-China trade war has made it more difficult for US companies to do business in China. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and has restricted the sale of US technology to Chinese companies. The Biden administration has taken a more conciliatory approach to China, but it has not reversed the Trump administration's policies on technology exports. The decision to block the Intel export licence is a sign that the US is still concerned about China's artificial intelligence capabilities. It is also a sign that the US is willing to use trade restrictions to protect its interests. The decision is likely to have a negative impact on the US artificial intelligence industry. Intel is a leading supplier of chips for artificial intelligence applications. The decision will make it more difficult for US companies to develop artificial intelligence products. The decision could also damage relations between the US and China. China has already criticised the US for blocking the Intel export licence. The decision could lead to further retaliation from China. The US-China relationship is already strained. The two countries have clashed over a range of issues, including trade, technology, and human rights. The decision to block the Intel export licence is likely to further damage the relationship.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
GP recruitment drive film 'tackles outdated stereotypes',"By Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News It has been launched by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), which claims at least 10,000 extra GPs will be needed by 2020. The three-minute film features doctors talking about how they find the job rewarding, but also extremely busy. It tackles outdated stereotypes, such as the suggestion that GPs are essentially ""gatekeepers"" whose main role is to block patients from accessing specialists. Rather it shows GPs proactively caring for the whole person, considering both their physical and mental health, and also the social circumstances that might be affecting them. In the film, newly qualified GP Dr Aneel Bhangu says: ""If you're interested in a career that's diverse and challenging, I would encourage you to look at general practice."" Dr Amir Hannan, who appears in the film alongside his wife, a fellow GP, adds: ""It's such a lovely feeling helping people get better, and that's what makes the late nights and early mornings all worthwhile."" 'Cradle to grave' care In 2017 the Health Foundation warned that the UK was facing a shortage of 10,000 family doctors by 2020. The RCGP says the situation has not improved. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, told the BBC: ""There are some outdated stereotypes about general practice that just aren't true. ""The truth is that GPs are on the frontline of healthcare, offering 'cradle to grave' care to their patients. ""They are also highly skilled clinicians who are doing more complex work than ever before."" 'Exceptionally challenging' The recruitment campaign is also targeting medical students. The film features current students talking about what attracted them to the profession. One of these is Anushka Patel, a fourth-year medical student at King's College London. She says: ""I've always loved the idea of helping people. Medicine is a really diverse profession, and general practice offers something different every day."" NHS England says it is ""committed"" to increasing the GP workforce and has allocated £2bn to help recruit family doctors. But Prof Stokes-Lampard says it will be ""exceptionally challenging"" to meet the target of 10,000 extra GPs by 2020. She said: ""We need to ensure that the current and future GP workforce is supported to stay in general practice, and that medical students and junior doctors are attracted to a career in general practice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Autism brain secrets revealed by scan,"Scans revealed children carrying the gene variant appeared to have more nerve cell ""connections"" within the frontal lobe. They had fewer connections in the temporal lobe, another brain area involved in autism. The findings help explain why the gene variant boosts the chance of autism - which affects one in 100 children in the UK. The variant is found in a gene that provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein plays a crucial role in the brain's development. In people with autism, FMRP is often faulty or missing altogether. The new research suggests that the faulty FMRP protein disrupts the normal pruning process that occurs in the brain during childhood. This process involves the shedding of excess nerve cell connections, which helps to refine the brain's neural networks. In children with the gene variant, the pruning process is thought to be less efficient, leading to an overgrowth of connections in some brain areas and a shortage in others. This imbalance may underlie the social and communication difficulties seen in autism. Dr Emily Jones, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""Our findings provide new insights into the biological mechanisms that underpin autism. ""We hope that this research will lead to new treatments that can target the underlying causes of the condition."" The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. It involved 153 children with autism and 112 typically developing children. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure the thickness of the cortex - the outermost layer of the brain - in different brain regions. They also used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the number of nerve cell connections in different brain areas. The researchers found that children with autism had thinner cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes, compared with typically developing children. They also found that children with the gene variant had more nerve cell connections in the frontal lobe and fewer connections in the temporal lobe. These findings suggest that the FMRP gene variant disrupts the normal pruning process that occurs in the brain during childhood. This leads to an imbalance of nerve cell connections in different brain areas, which may underlie the social and communication difficulties seen in autism.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Domestic violence legal aid changes were 'invalid',"Rights of Women said victims were being unlawfully denied funding in civil court cases because of changes made by ex-Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling. A rule that proof of domestic violence must be less than 24 months old was ""invalid"", the charity said. It added that guidance making victims provide evidence to police was ""unlawful"". Changes brought in by Grayling in 2013 ""were invalid because they were not made in accordance with Parliament's intention,"" Rights of Women said. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""carefully considering"" the judgment. The charity said its analysis of the changes, introduced in March 2013, showed women in eight out of 10 cases did not get legal aid because of the new rules. It is now calling for the old rules to be reinstated. Harriet Wistrich, director of Rights of Women, said: ""This is a hugely significant judgment. ""It means that the government has been unlawfully denying victims of domestic violence access to justice by wrongly removing their entitlement to legal aid. ""The government must now reinstate the old rules."" The case was brought by two women represented by the charity. In a judgment on Wednesday, the Upper Tribunal said the changes - which were designed to save the government money - were ""invalid"" because they were not ""made in accordance with Parliament's intention"". The tribunal added that a provision ""had the effect of denying access to justice to victims of domestic violence"" and that guidance issued by the Legal Aid Agency was ""unlawful"". The judgment is the latest in a series of legal challenges to Grayling's cuts to legal aid. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that changes to legal aid for civil cases were ""irrational"" because they would ""deny access to justice to some of the most vulnerable in society"". The Ministry of Justice said it was ""carefully considering"" the judgment. ""We are committed to providing access to justice for victims of domestic violence,"" a spokesman said.

Vietnam War: French court to hear landmark Agent Orange case,"The case was brought by Tran To Nga, a 78-year-old French-Vietnamese woman who covered the conflict as a journalist. She accuses the chemical firms of causing harm to her and other victims by knowingly producing and supplying a toxic herbicide that was widely used by the US military during the war. Agent Orange was a defoliant used by the US military to clear vegetation that could provide cover for enemy troops. It contained a highly toxic chemical compound called dioxin, which has been linked to a range of health problems including cancer, birth defects and nerve damage. Nga alleges that she was exposed to Agent Orange while reporting on the war and that she has suffered from health problems as a result. She is seeking compensation from the chemical firms for her suffering and for the suffering of other victims. The chemical firms have denied liability, arguing that they were not responsible for the way that Agent Orange was used by the US military. They also argue that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that Agent Orange causes the health problems that Nga and other victims allege. The case is being closely watched by victims of Agent Orange and their advocates. If Nga is successful in her case, it could set a precedent for other victims to seek compensation from the chemical firms. The trial is expected to last several weeks. The court will hear evidence from both sides and will then make a decision on whether the chemical firms are liable for the harm caused by Agent Orange. The case is a landmark moment in the fight for justice for victims of Agent Orange. It is the first time that a court has heard a case against the chemical firms that produced and supplied the herbicide. The outcome of the case could have a significant impact on the lives of victims of Agent Orange and their families.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Gentoo penguins are four species, not one","By Helen Briggs BBC Environment correspondent According to new evidence, the birds are slightly different in shape and size, and can be told apart by their DNA. Counting them as separate species will help in conservation, they argue, making it easier to focus resources on protecting the most vulnerable. There's Adelie, Chinstrap, King and Gentoo penguins. But a new study that looked at the DNA of these black-and-white birds suggests that Gentoos are actually four different species, not one. The differences between them may be subtle but they are there, says the team at the University of California in San Diego. The birds vary slightly in shape and size, and each has a slightly different song. Their DNA also shows significant differences. This means that what was previously considered a single species of Gentoo penguin is now four separate species: Northern Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) Southern Gentoo (Pygoscelis taeniata) Eastern Gentoo (Pygoscelis ellsworthi) Western Gentoo (Pygoscelis adamsi) The researchers say that around 80% of the world's Gentoo penguins are in the Northern Gentoo species. They live in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. The other three species breed on different islands and archipelagos in the Southern Ocean and the sub-Antarctic. ""We propose the recognition of four Gentoo penguin species, which will contribute to more effective conservation,"" the team concludes in a paper published in the journal Molecular Ecology. ""Defining separate species for management and conservation is crucial for protecting biodiversity,"" said Dr Steve Emslie, from the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the new research. ""As the Gentoo penguin group is distinctive, genetically divergent, and occupies separate breeding ranges, these are all good reasons to consider them separate species."" This will help in conservation, they argue, making it easier to focus resources on protecting the most vulnerable. For example, they say that the Southern and Western Gentoo penguins may be bigger, but they are also less numerous, and more in need of protection. Lead researcher Michael Parsons said: ""Under the current paradigm, all Gentoo penguin populations are assessed as a single unit. As a result, the smaller and less-known populations such as the Southern and Western Gentoos may not be receiving the conservation attention they deserve."" Dr Emslie said that work needs to continue to understand the distinctions between the different types of Gentoo penguin. ""DNA analysis is a useful tool, but it's not the only way of separating species,"" he said. ""We also look at the birds' morphology - their shape and size - as well as their behaviour, distribution and ecology. By combining all of this information, we can build up a comprehensive picture of each species.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Microsoft reports better-than-expected earnings,"The firm reported a net income of $6.56bn (£3.94bn) for the quarter, up from $6.38bn a year earlier.

Microsoft's revenue for the quarter was $11.36bn, up from $10.85bn a year earlier. This was also above analysts' expectations, who had predicted revenue of $11.28bn. The company's cloud computing business, Azure, continues to be a major growth driver. Azure revenue grew by 30% year-over-year to $4.33bn. Microsoft's Office 365 software subscription service also continues to grow, with revenue growing by 18% year-over-year to $3.63bn. Microsoft's earnings report is a sign that the company is continuing to benefit from the shift to cloud computing and other digital services.

Sony to sell PC unit and cut jobs,"The company will also split its TV division into a separate subsidiary as part of its restructuring programme. The moves were announced as Sony forecast a 12% fall in annual net profit to 300 billion yen (£2.4bn). Sony said it was unable to predict a turnaround in its PC business and that its TV division had been ""negatively impacted by intensified competition in the global TV market"". Sony has not sold PCs in the US for more than a decade and has seen its market share plummet in recent years as competitors such as Lenovo and Dell have taken hold. Other key factors in the decline of Sony's PC business include the rise of smartphones and tablets, which have replaced laptops for many consumers. The TV division, meanwhile, has been hit by competition from South Korean rivals such as Samsung and LG, which have been able to offer lower prices and more advanced features. Sony has also struggled to compete with the growing popularity of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which have reduced demand for traditional TV sets. The restructuring programme is expected to take two years to complete and will involve the loss of 5,000 jobs worldwide, or around 3% of Sony's global workforce. The company said it would also sell its Vaio PC brand, which it acquired in 2014. The news comes as Sony faces increasing pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb, who has called for the company to sell off its entertainment and financial services divisions and focus on its core electronics business. Loeb, who owns a 0.6% stake in Sony, has also called for the company to buy back its own shares and increase its dividends. Sony's restructuring programme is a significant step towards addressing the challenges it faces in its core businesses. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to satisfy investors and return the company to profitability.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Chris Christie rules himself out of White House race,"Mr Christie held a news conference at the governor's office, where he told reporters: ""Now is not my time."" The Republican has spent the past week traveling around New Hampshire, a key early voting state, and meeting with voters. But he said that after much thought, he had decided not to run for president. ""This was a difficult decision, but it is the right one for me and my family,"" Mr Christie said. ""I am proud of the work we have done in New Jersey, and I am excited about the future of our state."" Mr Christie was considered to be a top contender for the Republican nomination. He is a charismatic and experienced politician who has a strong record as governor. But he has also been dogged by scandals, including the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal. In recent months, Mr Christie's poll numbers have declined. He is currently trailing Donald Trump and Jeb Bush in the Republican primary polls. Mr Christie's decision not to run for president is a major blow to the Republican Party. He was one of the party's most popular and well-known figures. His departure from the race leaves the field of Republican candidates wide open. It is unclear what Mr Christie's next move will be.

Gay marriage opposed by Welsh ministers David Jones and Stephen Crabb,"His fellow Conservative and Wales Office deputy Stephen Crabb will also oppose the move. Prime Minister David Cameron faces criticism from senior Conservatives opposed to the reforms. Both Mr Jones and Mr Crabb face accusations of homophobia. But supporters say it is a matter of conscience and have warned Mr Cameron he risks alienating voters by pursuing reform. Same-sex marriage is expected to be legalised in England and Wales by 2015 if a Bill is passed. The legislation has already been published and consultation is under way. Northern Ireland and Scotland have the power to create their own laws on the issue.    Mr Jones, who is also the Secretary of State for Wales, said: ""I believe marriage is the union of a man and a woman and I know that many of my constituents share that view."" He added: ""I understand that some people believe same-sex couples should be able to marry, but I do not share that view.""   Mr Crabb, who was elected in 2005, said his ""personal view"" was that marriage was between a man and a woman. He added: ""This is not a matter of homophobia at all, but rather an issue of what the legal definition of marriage actually is and what this should be going forward."" Sayeeda Warsi, Co-Chair of the Conservative Party, said the government's proposed changes to the definition of marriage would ""strengthen society"". She warned Mr Cameron he risks alienating voters if he pursues reform. ""I get the sense that in the country and in the party, that the public are losing patience with this constant focus on same-sex marriage and gay issues,"" she said. ""It is becoming an alienating issue. I think that the prime minister needs to remember that we need to be seen as speaking to the whole of society and not just one privileged group.""    The Prime Minister has said he wants to make same-sex marriage legal because it is ""the right thing to do"". He said he believes it is a matter of equality, and that gay and lesbian couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples.    The issue of same-sex marriage has been the subject of much debate in recent years. Both sides of the argument have strong feelings on the matter. Those in favour of same-sex marriage say it is a matter of equality and that all couples should have the same rights. Those opposed to same-sex marriage say it is not in accordance with their religious beliefs, and that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police',"Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police' Despite acknowledging ""collective failings"" in the prosecution case of the climate change activist, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has concluded that there was no misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police in relation to undercover officer Mark Kennedy. The watchdog's investigation found that evidence from Kennedy, who infiltrated environmental groups for seven years, had not been properly shared or recorded. This led to the collapse of the trial last year of six activists accused of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass in 2009. However, the IPCC said there was no evidence that any officer had ""knowingly or recklessly misled"" the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It also found that the failure to disclose Kennedy's evidence was not due to ""a deliberate attempt to suppress material beneficial to the defendants."" The IPCC's findings have been welcomed by Nottinghamshire Police, which said it was ""disappointed"" by the collapse of the trial but accepted the watchdog's conclusions. ""We have learned lessons from this case and have already made improvements to our disclosure processes,"" said Chief Constable Craig Guildford. ""We are committed to ensuring that such failings do not happen again."" The activists who were cleared of the charges last year have expressed disappointment at the IPCC's findings. ""It's clear that there were serious failings in the prosecution process,"" said one of the activists, who did not want to be named. ""The IPCC's report doesn't go far enough in holding the police to account."" The IPCC's investigation was launched following a critical report by the Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, Paddy Tipping. Tipping found that there had been a ""catalogue of errors"" in the prosecution case, including the failure to disclose Kennedy's evidence. In response to the IPCC's findings, Tipping said: ""I am concerned that the report does not go far enough in addressing the systemic failures that led to the collapse of the trial."" He added: ""I will be writing to the Home Secretary to raise my concerns and to call for a full public inquiry into the role of undercover policing in the environmental movement.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Middlesbrough Council children's services supervision continues,"Middlesbrough Council was praised for its response to a finding in January of ""serious and widespread failures"". The report said children were left too long in harmful situations and risks were not properly recognised. A government official said the authority had ""demonstrated a real commitment to improving children's services"" since the inspection. Inspectors from Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the council had made ""significant progress"" in addressing the issues raised in the previous report. They found that children were now being protected better and were receiving better support. The report said: ""The council has a clear vision for children's services and is committed to improving the lives of children and young people in Middlesbrough. ""Since the last inspection, the council has taken significant steps to improve the quality of social work practice. ""This has led to a reduction in the number of children who are being looked after and an increase in the number of children who are being supported to live safely with their families."" The report also praised the council for its work with partners, such as the police and health services. It said: ""The council is working effectively with partners to identify and support children who are at risk of harm. ""This includes working with schools to ensure that children are safe and are receiving the support they need."" The council's executive member for children's services, Councillor Tony Baxter, said the report was a ""positive reflection"" of the hard work of council staff. He said: ""We have made significant progress in improving children's services in Middlesbrough. ""We know that there is still more to do, but we are confident that we are moving in the right direction."" The government official said the council should continue to focus on improving the quality of social work practice. He said: ""The council must ensure that all social workers have the skills and knowledge they need to protect children and promote their well-being.

Tikrit: Iran key in fight to wrest city from IS,"By Nafiseh Kohnavard BBC Persian, Beirut Shia militia sources in Iraq have confirmed that Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, has been visiting Tikrit to oversee operations to retake the city from the Islamic State group. Gen Soleimani has been closely involved in the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, and he is credited with playing a key role in the liberation of Jurf al-Sakhar and other towns and cities from the jihadists. His presence in Tikrit is a sign of the importance that Iran attaches to the battle for the city, which is seen as a key strategic objective in the fight against IS. The Iraqi army, backed by Shia militias and Iranian advisers, launched an offensive to retake Tikrit on 2 March. The city is a former stronghold of Saddam Hussein and is seen as a symbolic prize for IS. The operation to retake Tikrit has been slow and bloody, with hundreds of Iraqi soldiers and Shia militiamen killed or wounded. IS has been putting up fierce resistance, and has used suicide bombers and car bombs to target Iraqi forces. However, the Iraqi army and its allies have made some progress in recent days, and they are now believed to be in control of most of the city. IS fighters are still holding out in some areas, but they are expected to be defeated in the coming days. The liberation of Tikrit would be a major blow to IS, which has been losing ground in Iraq and Syria in recent months. It would also be a significant victory for the Iraqi government and its allies, and it would help to boost morale among Iraqi forces. Iran has been a key player in the fight against IS in Iraq, and it is likely to continue to play a role in the country's future. Gen Soleimani's presence in Tikrit is a sign of Iran's commitment to the fight against the jihadists, and it is a reminder of the important role that Iran is playing in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pte Sean Benton: Sister hopes Army will learn from Deepcut inquest,"Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five gunshot wounds to his chest at the Surrey army base in 1995. The coroner, Judge Peter Rook QC, concluded on Wednesday that he suffered an ""unsurvivable"" head injury ""as a consequence of a violent struggle."" The inquest heard that Pte Benton had been transferred to Deepcut after he was suspected of making death threats against a fellow recruit at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. His sister, Tracy Lewis, said she hoped the Army would learn from his tragic death. ""I hope they look at all the evidence and try to improve things so that this never happens again,"" she said. The inquest heard that Pte Benton had been struggling to cope with Army life and had been bullied by his superiors. He had also been prescribed antidepressants and sleeping pills. On the day of his death, he had been on a training exercise when he went missing. His body was found later that day in a wooded area of the base. The inquest heard that there were a number of inconsistencies in the Army's account of what happened on the day of Pte Benton's death. For example, the Army initially said that he had been shot while trying to escape from custody. However, the inquest heard that he was not in custody at the time of his death. The Army also initially said that Pte Benton had been shot by a single bullet. However, the inquest heard that he had been shot five times. Judge Rook said that he was ""satisfied"" that Pte Benton had been killed by another person. However, he said that there was not enough evidence to say who that person was. He also said that he was ""concerned"" about the Army's handling of the investigation into Pte Benton's death. He said that the Army had ""failed to adequately investigate"" a number of key issues. The Army has said that it will ""carefully consider"" the coroner's findings. It has also said that it is ""committed to learning from the tragic events"" of Pte Benton's death.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Newquay man weeding his way around town,"Alex Russell, from Newquay in Cornwall, suffers with anxiety and depression but said starting the activity during the lockdown helped with his mental health. The 21-year-old said: ""I started doing it for something to do. It keeps my mind occupied and helps take my mind off everything. ""I've only been doing it for a couple of months, but I've already noticed a difference in my mental health. ""I'm less anxious and I'm sleeping better. I'm also more motivated to do other things."" Alex is not the only one who has found solace in weeding during the lockdown. Greenfingers, a charity that supports gardening in healthcare facilities, has reported a surge in interest in its services since the start of the pandemic. Chief executive Sue Allen said: ""Gardening can be a great way to improve mental health and well-being. ""It can help to reduce stress, improve mood and boost self-esteem. ""It can also provide a sense of purpose and achievement."" Alex said he would encourage others to give weeding a try. ""It's a great way to get some fresh air and exercise, and it can really help with your mental health,"" he said. ""Even if you don't have a garden, you can still get involved by helping out with a local community group or gardening project."" Here are some tips for getting started with weeding: Start small. Don't try to tackle your entire garden at once. Just focus on a small area that you can easily manage. Use the right tools. A good weeding tool will make the job much easier. There are a variety of tools available, so find one that you find comfortable to use. Be patient. Weeding can be a slow and tedious job, but it's worth it in the end. Just take your time and enjoy the process. Be mindful. Weeding can be a great opportunity to practice mindfulness. Pay attention to the sensations of your body as you work, and focus on the present moment. Enjoy the results. Once you've finished weeding, take a step back and admire your work. You'll be amazed at how much better your garden looks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
British Airways fined £20m over data breach,"The breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data.

""We are pleased that the ICO has recognised the significant steps we have taken since the incident to enhance our data security,"" the statement said. ""We remain committed to protecting our customers' data and we will continue to invest in our security measures."" The ICO said it had taken into account BA's ""prompt and effective response"" to the breach when setting the fine. ""BA has taken a number of positive steps since the breach, including investing significantly in its IT security and appointing an independent expert to review its data protection practices,"" the ICO said in a statement. ""We believe that the £20m fine reflects the seriousness of the breach, but also recognises the positive steps that BA has taken since then."" The BA breach is one of the largest data breaches in recent years. It affected around 400,000 customers and resulted in the loss of personal data, including names, addresses, email addresses, and credit card numbers. The breach was caused by a cyber-attack on BA's website. The attackers were able to access customer data by exploiting a vulnerability in the website's software. BA has since taken a number of steps to improve its IT security, including: Investing in new security software and hardware Appointing an independent expert to review its data protection practices Updating its staff on data protection best practices The ICO's investigation into the BA breach is ongoing.

Richard Desmond 'plans National Lottery bid',"The plans by Mr Desmond, who runs the Health Lottery, have been reported in the Financial Times. Camelot has held the UK's lottery franchise since it was set up in 1994, operating it on behalf of the government and the National Lottery Distribution Fund. The current licence expires in 2024 and the Gambling Commission is expected to start the process of awarding the new licence next year. The Health Lottery was launched in 2011 and is operated by Mr Desmond's Northern & Shell media group. It has faced criticism for its low returns to good causes, but Mr Desmond has said it has raised more than £100m for health-related charities. Camelot has said it does not comment on speculation about the lottery licence. In a statement, the Gambling Commission said: ""We will run a fair and open competition for the fourth National Lottery licence, which will ensure that the lottery is run with integrity and that it continues to raise significant sums of money for good causes."" Mr Desmond is a controversial figure in the media industry. He owns the Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers, as well as the OK! magazine brand. He has been accused of using his media outlets to promote his business interests and attack his rivals. In 2012, he was found guilty of phone hacking by the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics. The Health Lottery has also been criticised for its links to Mr Desmond's other businesses. In 2015, the Gambling Commission fined the Health Lottery £6m for failing to prevent money laundering. The commission said the Health Lottery had failed to carry out proper checks on customers who were depositing large sums of money. Mr Desmond has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the Health Lottery is a legitimate business. If Mr Desmond's bid for the National Lottery licence is successful, it would give him control of one of the UK's most lucrative gambling operations. The National Lottery generates around £4bn in revenue each year, with around £2bn going to good causes. The Gambling Commission is expected to make a decision on the new licence in 2023.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scientists find 'better way' to grow adult stem cells,"Standard surfaces have proved limited for growing large amounts and retaining the stem cells' useful characteristics. It is hoped the discovery could lead to the creation of stem cell therapies to treat a range of conditions. The researchers, whose work is published in Nature Communications, used a technique called electrospinning to create a nanofibre scaffold that mimics the natural environment of stem cells. This scaffold provides a more supportive and three-dimensional structure for the cells to grow on. In tests, the researchers found that the new scaffold allowed them to grow 10 times more stem cells than on standard surfaces. The stem cells also retained their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types, which is essential for their use in therapies. ""This is a significant breakthrough in the field of stem cell research,"" said lead researcher Professor Molly Stevens of Imperial College London. ""For the first time, we have been able to grow large amounts of stem cells on a surface that mimics their natural environment. This opens up the potential for using stem cells to treat a range of conditions, from heart disease to Alzheimer's."" The researchers are now working on developing the technology further and testing it in clinical trials. They hope that the new scaffold could eventually be used to create stem cell therapies that are safe and effective for treating a wide range of diseases. Stem cells are unspecialised cells that have the potential to develop into any cell in the body. They are therefore seen as a promising source of cells for use in therapies to treat a range of conditions, such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. However, growing stem cells in the laboratory has proved challenging. Standard surfaces have not been able to support the growth of large amounts of stem cells, and the cells often lose their ability to differentiate into different cell types. The new scaffold developed by the researchers overcomes these problems. It provides a more supportive and three-dimensional structure for the cells to grow on, and it helps to maintain their ability to differentiate. This makes it a promising platform for the development of stem cell therapies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says","Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, the Ministry of Justice said. Prisoners will only be allowed out for a few hours at a time, with no overnight stays, and only if they are assessed as being at low risk of reoffending. The changes follow a review of the scheme by the Ministry of Justice, which found that it was not working as well as it could be. The review found that some prisoners were being released on day release who should not have been, and that the scheme was not doing enough to help prisoners reintegrate into society. The new rules will be introduced in phases, starting with a pilot scheme in six prisons. The pilot scheme will run for six months, and the results will be evaluated before the new rules are rolled out to all prisons. The Ministry of Justice said that the new rules will make the scheme more effective and will help to protect the public. The changes have been welcomed by some, but others have expressed concern that they will make it harder for prisoners to reintegrate into society. The Prison Reform Trust said that the changes were ""a step in the wrong direction"" and that they would make it harder for prisoners to maintain family ties and to find work. However, the Howard League for Penal Reform said that the changes were ""necessary"" and that they would help to make the scheme more effective. The changes to the day release scheme are part of a wider package of reforms to the prison system. The reforms include plans to introduce new ""boot camps"" for young offenders and to give prisoners more opportunities to learn skills and qualifications. The government says that the reforms are necessary to make the prison system more effective and to reduce reoffending.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cancer costing European Union countries 'billions',"The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a ""huge burden"". The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of healthcare, lost productivity and premature death. The study found that the annual economic cost of cancer in the EU was €179 billion (£155 billion; $209 billion). This is equivalent to 1.3% of the EU's gross domestic product (GDP). The cost of cancer is expected to rise to €246 billion (£214 billion; $289 billion) by 2030. The study also found that the number of cancer cases in the EU is expected to increase by 26% by 2030. This is due to a number of factors, including the ageing population and unhealthy lifestyles. The five most common cancers in the EU are breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. The study's authors say that the rising cost of cancer is a major concern for European governments. They say that more needs to be done to prevent cancer and to improve the treatment and care of cancer patients. The European Commission has pledged to invest €4 billion (£3.5 billion; $4.7 billion) in cancer research over the next seven years. The Commission is also working to improve access to cancer screening and treatment. Cancer is a major public health challenge in the EU. The rising cost of cancer is a concern for governments and healthcare systems. More needs to be done to prevent cancer and to improve the treatment and care of cancer patients. What can be done to reduce the cost of cancer? There are a number of things that can be done to reduce the cost of cancer, including: Prevention: Preventing cancer is the most effective way to reduce its cost. This can be done by promoting healthy lifestyles, such as eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular exercise. It is also important to get vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B, which can both cause cancer. Early detection: Detecting cancer early can lead to more effective treatment and better outcomes for patients. This is why it is important to get regular cancer screenings, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and Pap tests. Effective treatment: Advances in cancer treatment have led to improved survival rates for patients. However, cancer treatment can be expensive. Governments and healthcare systems need to ensure that patients have access to the most effective treatments. Palliative care: Palliative care is important for improving the quality of life for cancer patients. This care can help patients manage their symptoms and cope with the challenges of living with cancer. By taking these steps, we can reduce the cost of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Man guilty of killing unborn baby by kicking mum's stomach,"Malorie Bantala, 22, was ambushed outside her Peckham home by Kevin Wilson, 22, and a teenager on 15 June. She suffered life-threatening injuries and was rushed to hospital where her baby boy was delivered stillborn. Wilson was convicted of manslaughter and child destruction at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. The teenager was cleared of all charges. The court heard that Wilson had been in a relationship with Ms Bantala, but they had split up a few months before the attack. On the day of the incident, Wilson and the teenager approached Ms Bantala as she was walking home from work. Wilson began kicking and punching her in the stomach, causing her to collapse. Prosecutor Alexandra Healy QC said that the attack was ""motivated by anger and jealousy"". She said that Wilson had been ""angry that [Ms Bantala] had moved on with her life"" and that he had ""intended to cause her really serious harm"". Wilson denied the charges, claiming that he had acted in self-defense. He said that Ms Bantala had attacked him with a knife and that he had only kicked her in order to disarm her. The jury rejected Wilson's claims and found him guilty of manslaughter and child destruction. He is due to be sentenced on 22 November. In a statement, Ms Bantala said that she was ""relieved"" that Wilson had been found guilty. She said that the attack had ""destroyed my life"" and that she was still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her baby. ""I want to thank the jury for finding him guilty,"" she said.

He told the Business select committee: ""It's not unreasonable ... to say 'look we're interested in the assets but this would be an issue'."" The UK government has been trying to sell Tata Steel's UK operations since they were put up for sale in March. But Mr Javid said selling the whole of the business could lead to the government having to bail out the pension fund. He said: ""The key issue with Tata Steel is not the assets. The assets are attractive and you've already had people express interest. ""The issue is the pension fund. It's a huge pension fund and it's got a big deficit. ""If we were to sell the whole of Tata Steel, the government would be on the hook for that pension fund. So that is a major issue.""

Wales weather: M4 clear after Storm Frank flooding,"Police dealt with three separate crashes where there was standing water on both sides of the carriageway between junctions 35 (Pencoed) and 36 (Sarn). Flooding also blocked one lane eastbound near junction 32 (Coryton Interchange). Officers advised drivers to avoid driving through floodwater and, if they had to, to reduce their speed. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Ely burst its banks in St Athan throughout the night, leading to flooding on the A48 and nearby roads, but the water was receding by Monday morning. It also issued a number of flood alerts across the south of the country, including the River Taff catchment, River Cynon, River Rhondda, River Ewenny, River Ogmore and River Ely. The Met Office said that while most of the rain from Storm Frank had now passed, further heavy showers were expected on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. NRW warned that river levels are likely to remain high in some areas for the next few days, and that further flooding could occur if there is heavy rainfall. The Environment Agency in England has also issued a number of flood alerts and warnings, including for the River Severn and the River Thames. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain for south-west England and south Wales, which is in place until Tuesday morning. It said there is a risk of further flooding and travel disruption in some areas. The RAC said it had attended more than 5,000 breakdowns on Sunday, with the majority of call-outs being for vehicles that had broken down due to flooding. It urged drivers to avoid driving through floodwater, as even a small amount of water can cause a vehicle to stall.

Cambridgeshire teen felt 'not believed' after abuse probe dropped,"Chris Gould, 17, died in January 2019 while an informal patient at a mental health unit near Cambridge. Her parents told the inquest that clinicians felt alleged sexual abuse by a member of staff was ""not credible"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the unit, said it was ""deeply sorry"" for Chris's death and accepted the inquest's findings. The inquest heard that Chris had been admitted to the unit in December 2018 after attempting to take her own life. She had a history of self-harm and had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. While at the unit, Chris alleged that she had been sexually abused by a member of staff. The allegations were investigated by the police, but no charges were brought. Chris's parents said they were ""not believed"" by clinicians when they raised concerns about the alleged abuse. They said that they felt ""fobbed off"" and that the unit was ""more interested in protecting its staff than in protecting patients"". The inquest jury found that the alleged abuse was a ""contributory factor"" to Chris's death. It also found that the unit had failed to provide adequate care for Chris and that there had been a ""lack of communication"" between staff. The trust said it had ""learned lessons"" from Chris's death and had made changes to its safeguarding procedures. It said it was ""committed to providing safe and high-quality care for all patients"". Chris's parents said they were ""relieved"" that the inquest had found that the alleged abuse was a ""contributory factor"" to their daughter's death. They said they hoped that the trust would ""learn from its mistakes"" and that other families would not have to go through what they had. The inquest is one of a number of recent cases that have raised concerns about the care of young people in mental health units. In February, an inquest into the death of 14-year-old Amy El-Keria found that she had been failed by the mental health system. Amy died in 2019 after taking her own life. The government has said that it is committed to improving the care of young people in mental health units. In March, it announced a £500 million investment in mental health services for children and young people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Chase criticised for 'mocking' customers' spending habits,"By Georgina Rannard BBC News Offering financial advice on Twitter, the bank appeared to chastise consumers who question their low bank balances but buy take-away coffee and short taxi rides. The meme was roundly criticized for being condescending and out of touch with the financial difficulties faced by many people. ""Millions of people are worried about the rising cost of living and how to make ends meet,"" said a spokesperson for the consumer group Which? ""It's unhelpful and unkind for a bank to imply that people are struggling financially because they are spending money on small treats or conveniences."" The bank has since apologized for the tweet, saying that it was not intended to be judgmental. ""We recognize that the cost of living is rising and that many people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are committed to helping our customers manage their finances and make the most of their money."" However, the tweet has sparked a wider debate about the role of banks in society. Some argue that banks should be doing more to help customers manage their finances, while others believe that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own financial decisions. ""Banks have a responsibility to help their customers,"" said Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com. ""They should be providing clear and impartial advice, and helping people to understand their finances and make informed decisions."" However, others argue that individuals need to take more responsibility for their own financial decisions. ""People need to be more aware of how they are spending their money and make changes if necessary,"" said a spokesperson for the National Consumer Council. ""Banks can't be held responsible for people's poor financial decisions."" The debate is likely to continue as the cost of living continues to rise. In the meantime, it is important for individuals to be aware of how they are spending their money and make changes if necessary. Banks can also play a role in helping customers manage their finances, but ultimately, individuals are responsible for their own financial decisions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ex-Australian PMs make appeal over Bali Nine drug pair,"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were given the death sentence in 2006 for leading a drug trafficking group known as the Bali Nine. The former prime ministers said they deserved clemency. An Indonesian official has told the BBC that President Widodo has not yet made a decision on the pair's fate, but that he is aware of the pleas for clemency. The former Australian prime ministers, Tony Abbott, John Howard and Malcolm Fraser, have written to Indonesian President Joko Widodo, urging him to grant clemency to two Australian drug smugglers on death row. In the letter, the former leaders said that Chan and Sukumaran had shown ""genuine remorse"" for their crimes and had been rehabilitated during their time in prison. They also said that the pair's execution would damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. ""We believe that the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran would be a grave injustice and a serious setback to the relationship between our two countries,"" the letter said. The letter was sent ahead of a meeting between Widodo and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Jakarta on Thursday. Turnbull is expected to raise the issue of Chan and Sukumaran's execution with Widodo. The Indonesian government has said that it will not grant clemency to Chan and Sukumaran. However, President Widodo has the final say on whether or not the pair will be executed. An Indonesian official has told the BBC that President Widodo has not yet made a decision on the pair's fate, but that he is aware of the pleas for clemency. ""The president is aware of the pleas for clemency,"" the official said. ""He is considering all of the factors involved, including the views of the Australian government."" The official said that President Widodo would make a decision on the pair's fate ""in due course."" Chan and Sukumaran were arrested in Bali in 2005 for attempting to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia. They were convicted and sentenced to death in 2006. The pair have been on death row since 2010. Their executions have been delayed several times. The Australian government has been lobbying the Indonesian government to grant clemency to Chan and Sukumaran.

"Sir Alan Parker, director of Bugsy Malone and Evita, dies aged 76","The double Oscar nominee's many other credits include Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning, The Commitments, Angela's Ashes and Birdy. Evita composer Andrew Lloyd Webber tweeted Sir Alan had been ""one of the few directors to truly understand musicals on screen"". The Phantom of the Opera and Cats impresario added: ""He will be much missed."" Sir Alan's death was announced by the British Film Institute. No cause of death was given. Born in Islington, north London, Sir Alan began his career as an advertising copywriter, before moving into film in the 1970s. His first feature as director, the London-set gangster comedy Bugsy Malone, was released in 1976 and starred children, including a young Jodie Foster. Bugsy Malone was followed by Midnight Express (1978), which was nominated for six Oscars and won two, and Fame (1980). Sir Alan was nominated for best director at the Academy Awards in 1988 for Mississippi Burning, an examination of race and civil rights in the US. In 1996, he directed the film version of Evita, for which Madonna received a Golden Globe Award for best actress in a musical or comedy. The Commitments, released in 1991, was a musical comedy about a group of young musicians from Dublin. The film was a critical and commercial success and launched the career of Irish singer Glen Hansard, who played the lead character. As well as feature films, Sir Alan also directed commercials, short films and music videos. He was awarded a Bafta Fellowship in 2013. He was married to Lisa Moran and is survived by their five children. Tributes have poured in for Sir Alan from the world of film and music. ""I am very sad to hear of the passing of Sir Alan Parker, a truly great British director who made so many iconic films,"" said BFI chair Tim Richards.

War Horse musicians lose legal bid,"The musicians took legal action last week following the theatre's decision to end their contribution - of playing live over a pre-recorded soundtrack. They had sought an injunction to be allowed back on stage, but their bid was unsuccessful. The theatre contends that the use of a pre-recorded soundtrack enhances the storytelling and brings the production closer to the film on which it is based. However, the musicians argued that they had a ""unique and irreplaceable role"" in the show and that their removal diminished the experience for audiences. In their High Court ruling, Deputy High Court Judge, Anthony Mann, said that while the musicians' removal had caused them ""considerable distress and disappointment"", it was within the theatre's rights to make the change. The judge also rejected the musicians' argument that the theatre had breached the terms of their agreement. A spokesperson for the theatre said that they were ""pleased with the court's decision"" and that they ""remain committed to providing our audiences with the best possible experience"". The theatre also said that they would be ""exploring ways to recognise the contribution that the musicians have made to War Horse over the past 10 years"". The musicians have expressed their disappointment with the outcome and are considering their options. They said in a statement, ""We're very sad to have to accept that the curtain has come down on our time at War Horse. We're proud of our contribution to the success of the show and we're grateful to the audiences who have enjoyed our music over the last decade.""

Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third,"Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third More than 2,500 charges were investigated in 2018-19, up from 1,894 the previous year. Alleged ""breach of security"" - which includes the unauthorised introduction of contraband - accounted for more than a third of all charges. The figures, obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to HM Prison and Probation Service, also show a rise in allegations of assault, violence, discrimination and bullying. There were 557 allegations of assault in 2018-19, compared with 389 the previous year. And there were 229 allegations of discrimination, up from 183 in 2017-18. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to creating a safe and secure environment for all prisoners and staff"" and that it would ""not tolerate any form of misconduct or abuse"". The rise in misconduct allegations comes at a time when the prison system is menghadapi increasing pressure. The number of people in prison in England and Wales has risen by more than 20,000 since 2010, and the prison population is now at its highest level since the early 19th century. The number of prison staff has also fallen in recent years, and there are now just over 28,000 prison officers in England and Wales, compared with 33,000 in 2010. This has led to concerns that prisons are understaffed and that staff are struggling to cope with the increased workload. The Prison Officers' Association said the rise in misconduct allegations was a ""serious concern"" and that it was a ""reflection of the pressure that prison staff are under"". ""The government needs to invest in the prison service and provide more resources for staff,"" said POA general secretary Steve Gillan. ""We also need to see a change in the culture of the prison system. Too often, prisoners are treated with disrespect and violence, and this creates a hostile and dangerous environment for staff."" The BBC spoke to several prison officers who said they had been victims of misconduct. One officer, who did not want to be named, said he had been assaulted by a prisoner on several occasions. ""I've been punched, kicked and spat at,"" he said. ""I've also been threatened with death. It's a very dangerous job, and I'm constantly worried about my safety."" Another officer said she had been discriminated against because of her gender. ""I've been told that I'm not strong enough to be a prison officer,"" she said. ""I've also been told that I'm only in the job because I want to meet men. It's really demoralising."" The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to protecting staff from harm"" and that it would ""not tolerate any form of misconduct or abuse"". ""We have introduced a number of measures to improve the safety of prison staff, including increasing the number of body-worn cameras and introducing new training programmes,"" a spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Theresa May warning over police targets 'comeback',"She told the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales that the government had scrapped ""top-down diktats"" and urged police confidence in the new approach. ""We have scrapped inappropriate top-down diktats,"" she said. ""The days of unrealistic targets and unnecessary bureaucracy are over."" The home secretary promised that the new policing model would give forces the flexibility to set their own targets and priorities. ""We will continue to work with you to develop a more flexible and less bureaucratic approach to policing that keeps the public safe,"" she said. May's comments come amid concerns that the government is planning to reintroduce police targets. Last year, the government announced that it would be scrapping police targets in favor of a new system of ""outcomes-based policing."" However, there have been reports that the government is considering bringing back some form of targets. In her speech, May did not rule out the possibility of reintroducing targets, but she said that any new system would be ""proportionate"" and ""effective."" ""We will not introduce targets for targets' sake,"" she said. ""Any targets we do introduce will be proportionate and effective."" May's comments were welcomed by the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales. ""We welcome the home secretary's commitment to a more flexible and less bureaucratic approach to policing,"" said Paul Griffiths, the association's president. ""We believe that this will give forces the freedom to set their own priorities and to focus on what matters most to their communities."" The government's decision to scrap police targets has been controversial. Some argue that targets are necessary to ensure that the police are held accountable for their performance. Others argue that targets can lead to perverse incentives and can result in the police focusing on the wrong things. The government's new policing model is still in its early stages of development. It remains to be seen whether it will be successful in reducing crime and improving public confidence in the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Bristol friends raise £5,500 after free school meal upset","Chloe and Imogen Wood were shocked to see the lack of food given to families for free school meals packages. In one week they raised £3,460 online and more than £2,000 offline, filling a dozen trolleys of food that were split between three local charities. They were inspired to act after seeing a photo on Facebook of a free school meal package sent to a family of four. ""It had two potatoes, two carrots, a small bag of pasta, one onion, a pepper and a 90p voucher for fruit and veg,"" Chloe said. ""That is not enough to feed a family, let alone a family of four for a week."" The sisters were so appalled by the image that they decided to do something about it. They launched a GoFundMe page, with the aim of raising enough money to provide 100 families with a week's worth of food. Within 24 hours, they had reached their target. A week later, they had raised more than £5,000. ""We were not expecting this at all,"" Chloe said. ""We thought we might get a few hundred pounds, but we never thought we would raise this much."" The sisters have been working with three local charities - the Trussell Trust, FareShare and Children's Food Aid Network - to distribute the food. They have also been working with local businesses to get food donated at a discounted price. They are using the money raised to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as long-life items such as pasta, rice and tinned food. The charities involved in the distribution of the food have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the sisters and the local community. ""This is an incredible gesture from Chloe and Imogen,"" said a spokesperson for the Trussell Trust. ""It will make a real difference to the families we support."" FareShare said the donation was ""a lifeline"" for the charity. ""We are so grateful to Chloe and Imogen for their support,"" a spokesperson said. ""This donation will help us to continue to provide vital food supplies to people in need."" The Children's Food Aid Network said the donation was ""a wonderful example of community spirit."" ""This is a great example of how people can come together to make a difference,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are so grateful to Chloe and Imogen for their support.""

Ronan Kerr's brother attacks Tom Elliott 'scum' remarks,"Tom Elliott hit out at people waving Irish flags at Omagh Leisure Centre, calling them the ""scum of Sinn Fein"". On his Twitter account, Cathair Kerr, Ronan Kerr's brother, attacked the comments, saying ""Look who's talking. Tom Elliott, former member of the Ulster Resistance terror gang."" Elliott, a former politician for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has a history of making controversial statements. In 2017, he was suspended from the party after he said he would not share a platform with Sinn Fein because they were ""terrorists"". Kerr's brother, Ronan Kerr, was a Catholic police officer who was killed by dissident republicans in 2011. Kerr was a vocal critic of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), accusing them of being too close to Sinn Fein. In a statement, the PSNI said it was ""aware of the comments made by Mr Elliott and is considering its response"". The incident has sparked outrage from politicians and community leaders. Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly said Elliott's comments were ""disgraceful"" and ""designed to stir up sectarian hatred"". SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Elliott's comments were ""deeply offensive"" and ""have no place in our society"". Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Elliott's comments were ""reckless and irresponsible"" and called on him to withdraw them. The Irish government has also condemned Elliott's comments. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Elliott's comments were ""inflammatory and unhelpful"" and called on him to ""reconsider his words"". Elliott has since apologized for his comments, saying he ""regrets the hurt and offense"" they caused. However, he has not withdrawn the comments. The incident has raised concerns about the rise of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. In recent years, there have been a number of incidents of sectarian violence, including attacks on churches and community centers. Police have warned that sectarianism is a ""serious threat"" to peace in Northern Ireland and have urged people to report any incidents of sectarianism to the police.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander,"The appointment of Mr Alexander to his second Cabinet post in less than a month marks the next step in his rapid political rise. Virtually unknown outside his native Scotland a decade ago, he is now one of the most influential figures in the UK government. Alexander, 41, was born in Perth and educated at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He worked as a financial journalist before entering politics, and was elected to the House of Commons in 2005. He served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2010 to 2015, and was responsible for overseeing the government's austerity programme. He was also involved in the negotiations that led to the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Alexander was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 2015, but he resigned from the post in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union. He has since been a vocal critic of Brexit, and has called for a second referendum on the issue. Alexander's appointment as Treasury Chief Secretary is seen as a sign that the government is taking a more pro-European stance. He is a strong supporter of the single market and the customs union, and he has said that he wants to ""keep all options on the table"" in the Brexit negotiations. Alexander's appointment has been welcomed by the business community. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that he was ""a safe pair of hands"" who would ""bring a wealth of experience to the role."" However, some critics have questioned Alexander's credentials for the job. They point out that he has no experience in the Treasury, and that he has been a vocal critic of the government's austerity programme. Despite the criticism, Alexander is expected to be a key figure in the government's Brexit negotiations. He is a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, and he is likely to play a leading role in shaping the government's approach to the talks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Childcare recruitment 'catastrophe' looms, say campaigners","By Judith Burns Education reporter New recruits to key jobs must have at least GCSE C grades in the subjects, with alternative equivalent qualifications no longer accepted. The Save our Early Years campaign group said it means a ""catastrophe"" is looming for the sector, with thousands of qualified candidates facing being turned away. The Department for Education (DfE) said the reforms were ""not about excluding people"" but ensuring all childcare professionals have strong literacy and numeracy skills. From September 2023, all level 2 and level 3 early years educators will need at least a C grade in GCSE English and maths, or an approved equivalent. This is a change from the current rules, which allow alternative qualifications, such as functional skills or entry-level certificates, to be used instead. The Save our Early Years campaign group said this will affect thousands of qualified candidates who do not have GCSEs or the approved equivalent qualifications. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, which runs nurseries in England, said: ""We are facing a recruitment catastrophe. ""This new requirement will make it all but impossible for nurseries to recruit new staff, which will inevitably lead to settings having to close or reduce their opening hours."" Mr Leitch said many people working in the early years sector come from disadvantaged backgrounds and may not have had the opportunity to achieve GCSEs. He said: ""The vast majority of them are incredibly capable and passionate about working with young children."" The DfE said the reforms were ""not about excluding people"" but ensuring all childcare professionals have strong literacy and numeracy skills. A DfE spokesperson said: ""Children deserve the best possible start in life and we want to make sure that all early years practitioners have strong literacy and numeracy skills. ""We are not seeking to exclude people from working in the sector, but to ensure they have the essential skills needed for effective practice."" The DfE said alternative routes into the sector will still be available for those who do not have GCSEs or equivalent qualifications, such as apprenticeships and traineeships.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
#ElPasochallenge: Boy responds to shooting to help community heal,"Ruben Martinez is the youngster behind the #elpasoCHALLENGE. He wants people to carry out 22 random acts of kindness to honour the victims of the El Paso shooting. The challenge, which has quickly spread on social media, comes in response to the horrific attack on a Walmart store in Texas, which left 22 people dead. Ruben, 12, is a sixth-grader at Bassett Middle School in El Paso. He is raising money for the El Paso Victims Relief Fund, which is providing financial assistance to those affected by the shooting. Ruben says he was inspired to start the challenge after seeing a quote from the Dalai Lama: ""If you want others to be happy, practise compassion. If you want to be happy, practise compassion."" He says: ""We have to be there for each other. We have to support each other. We have to show that we're stronger than this."" The challenge has already had a huge impact, with people across the country sharing their stories of how they are carrying out acts of kindness. One woman shared how she paid for the person behind her in the grocery line. Another told how she donated blood. Ruben says he is ""blown away"" by the response to the challenge.

NSA workers disciplined over Snowden leaks,"The employee was among three NSA workers sanctioned over the incident, according to an NSA memo. It is said to be the first disciplinary action taken over the breach, which the agency has previously called one of the ""most significant security breaches in US history"". The memo said two other employees had their security clearances revoked and were barred from accessing classified information. Snowden copied and leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance programs, including its PRISM program, which collected data from internet companies. The leaks sparked a global debate about the balance between national security and privacy. The NSA has said that the leaks caused ""significant damage"" to national security. The memo did not specify the specific actions taken against the three employees. The news of the disciplinary action comes amid growing scrutiny of the NSA's surveillance programs. In June, the US Senate voted to end the NSA's bulk collection of phone records. The program was authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The House of Representatives has yet to vote on the measure. The NSA has defended the bulk collection program, saying it is a valuable tool in preventing terrorism. However, critics say the program is an invasion of privacy and has not been shown to be effective in preventing terrorism. The disciplinary action against the three NSA workers is likely to further fuel the debate about the NSA's surveillance programs.

Manila district police force removed after teen deaths,"Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said 1,200 officers from the Caloocan district would be retrained and then assigned to other units. The move comes amid growing scrutiny of police operations amid accusations of extrajudicial killings and corruption. The Caloocan district police force has been under fire since the deaths of two teenagers in drug raids. The deaths of Kian Loyd delos Santos and Carl Angelo Arnaiz sparked outrage and protests in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte has defended the police, but has also said that he will not tolerate abuses. He has ordered the police to stop conducting drug raids and has created a new task force to investigate the deaths of the teenagers. The removal of the Caloocan district police force is a significant development. It is a sign that the government is taking the allegations of extrajudicial killings and corruption seriously. However, it remains to be seen whether the retraining and reassignment of the officers will be enough to address the systemic problems within the police force. The Philippine National Police (PNP) has been plagued by allegations of corruption and abuse for years. A 2017 report by the Human Rights Watch found that the PNP had ""a long history of committing grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances."" The report also found that the PNP was ""systematically failing to investigate and prosecute human rights violations committed by its officers."" The PNP has denied the allegations of systemic abuse and corruption. However, the recent deaths of the two teenagers have raised serious questions about the force's commitment to human rights. The removal of the Caloocan district police force is a welcome step, but it is only a first step. The government must do more to address the systemic problems within the PNP. This includes investigating and prosecuting human rights violations, reforming the force's training and recruitment procedures, and increasing transparency and accountability.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Stars stay silent in X Factor protest,"By Ian Youngs Entertainment reporter, BBC News Madness star Suggs and dance acts Orbital and Pendulum were among those who did nothing in a recording studio. They were recreating the recording session that led to the Sex Pistols' classic track ""God Save the Queen"". The Sex Pistols refused to sing along to the backing track, in a form of protest against the monarchy during the Queen's silver jubilee in 1977. The protesters hope to get their new version of the song to number one by the time of the Queen's diamond jubilee next year. Other stars taking part in the project include John Lydon, the singer with Public Image Ltd and former Sex Pistols frontman, Brian Eno, and Steve Mason of The Beta Band. The 2011 recording session took place on the 34th anniversary of the Sex Pistols' original protest. Orbital's main man Paul Hartnoll told BBC News: ""We've been asked to be part of the recording, basically, of re-enacting that moment, and all the participants in the recording are not singing on the track."" He said the recording was about ""making a point"" about the state of the UK. ""We've recorded the backing track, which is the Pistols' backing track, but nobody's singing on it. And the reason for that is that our generation doesn't have a voice. Our generation doesn't have anything to say. The people in charge haven't got a clue."" Suggs from Madness told BBC News why he got involved. ""For me, the Sex Pistols' 'God Save the Queen' in 1977 was one of the most important records of my teenage years,"" he said. ""It was a two-fingered salute to everything that was happening, the ridiculous week-long jubilee, and we've got something similar this year. ""And so I think it's important that we do it again and, if we do it again, then we should do it in the same way, just in silence."" Public Image Ltd singer John Lydon said the current state of the UK was more of a ""joke"" than it was in the 1970s. ""Anybody who thinks they have a voice, doesn't,"" he said. ""The country's a joke… It's worse than it was in '76. There's nothing."" ""So I think we should be very quiet, let's make a bloody noise with silence. I think it's a brilliant idea.""

Monmouthshire and Newport get 30 new electric car points,"A new scheme will provide free installation to 20 businesses, thanks to funding from the EU, Welsh Government and Monmouthshire council. Ten more will be installed in most Monmouthshire town centre car parks. That means the number of public electric car points in the county will increase by more than 30. Monmouthshire County Council's climate change and transport cabinet member, Cllr Jane Pratt, said: ""I'm really excited that we are able to offer this scheme to businesses and residents in Monmouthshire. ""This council is committed to tackling the climate emergency and reducing our carbon footprint and this scheme is one step towards encouraging and supporting the use of electric vehicles in Monmouthshire.""

"The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers","The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers Thursday evening's opening episode on BBC One attracted an average of 5.5 million viewers, a 26.3% share of the available viewing audience. The launch of the 17th series marked a significant decline in viewership compared to the previous year, when 6.4 million viewers tuned in for the premiere. The decline in ratings does not come as a complete surprise, as many reality TV shows have experienced a drop in viewership in recent years. However, the margin of the decline for The Apprentice is notable, particularly given the popular appeal of Lord Sugar as the show's host. The Apprentice has long been a staple of British television, known for its cutthroat challenges and revealing insights into the world of business. Previous contestants have gone on to establish successful careers in their respective industries, including Tim Campbell, the series' first winner, and Carina Lepore, who recently served as CEO of fashion brand Missguided. Despite the decline in viewership, BBC One remains confident in the show's appeal. A spokesperson for the channel said, ""The Apprentice is a hugely popular format that continues to attract a loyal audience. We are excited to see what this series has in store, with Lord Sugar putting 18 new candidates through their paces."" The series launch drew a mixed reaction from critics. Some praised the fresh faces and competitive challenges, while others criticized the lack of innovation and the predictable nature of the format. Despite the contrasting opinions, The Apprentice remains one of the most talked-about shows on British television. Its ability to spark conversation and inspire viewers to pursue their own business aspirations ensures its enduring relevance.

"Titanic menu expected to fetch up to £70,000 at auction","It was owned by Elise Lurette, who was one of about 700 people who survived after the passenger liner hit an iceberg in April 1912. She was working as a maid for a family travelling on the ship when disaster struck. Her menu has been passed down through the family, and her great-nephew David Reay is now selling it along with other personal effects that belonged to his great-aunt. Mr Reay, a retired teacher from Ringwood, Hampshire, decided to auction the items to raise money for the Alzheimer's Society and the RNLI. He said: ""Elise was only 21 when she was on the Titanic, and she went on to live to the grand old age of 94. ""When the ship hit the iceberg she was in bed, and she recalled that the chief steward came round telling all the passengers that they should get dressed, get their lifebelts on and go on deck. ""When they got on deck they were told to go back down to their cabins and wait for further instructions. ""At no time did anyone tell them to get into the lifeboats. She said the general feeling was that they were safer staying on the boat than getting into the lifeboats, which they felt were getting overloaded. ""It was a real last-minute thing, and she was one of the last people to get into a lifeboat. ""She said the crew were really good. She said they just quietly and calmly went about getting people into the lifeboats. ""She survived along with her mistress, Mrs Futrelle, and Mrs Futrelle's maid. ""My great-aunt didn't talk about it very much. She didn't dwell on it, but she must have thought about it an awful lot. ""My great-uncle, her husband, was a bit of a gambler, and a bit of a spendthrift, and he sold the menu about 40 years ago. I know it went to America. ""I'm quite pleased it's come back to England. I think it belongs in England."" The menu was printed on high-quality paper, measuring 7 1/2in by 10 1/2in, and folded in two. It was one of only a small number of first-class passenger menus to survive the sinking. It lists a dozen courses, including consomme Olga, poached salmon with mousseline sauce, roast beef, lamb, spring chicken, asparagus and Waldorf pudding.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Shetland Super Puma crash: Co-pilot's actions 'crucial' to survival,"Super Puma passengers Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, died when the aircraft came down on its approach to Sumburgh Airport in August 2013. The helicopter was operated by CHC Scotia, part of Canadian Helicopter Corporation, and carrying oil workers to and from North Sea platforms when it crashed. An investigation, published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), found the co-pilot's ""decisive and timely"" actions ""materially contributed to the survival"" of the 14 other passengers and crew on board. The AAIB report found that the helicopter had been flying too fast and low on its approach to Sumburgh. The co-pilot, who was in control of the aircraft, took over from the captain seven minutes before it crashed. The report said the co-pilot had been ""placed in a difficult position"" because of the captain's ""inadequate supervision"" and ""limited guidance"". It said he had been ""faced with a situation where he was receiving incorrect and ambiguous guidance from the captain, who appeared to have become confused and disorientated"". The co-pilot had been able to take control of the aircraft and avoid obstacles as it came in to land, but had been unable to prevent it from crashing into the sea. The AAIB said the co-pilot's actions had been ""crucial"" to the survival of the other passengers and crew on board. The report also made a number of recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and CHC Scotia, including improving training for pilots and providing them with better support. The CAA said it would be ""carefully considering"" the recommendations and would ""take any necessary action to improve safety"". CHC Scotia said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and that it was ""committed to working with the authorities to improve safety"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care,"Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care By Nick Triggle Health correspondent Nearly 1.85 million requests for support were made last year, but just over 650,000 people received help. Councils have been warning for a number of years that they are struggling to meet demand for the care that people are legally entitled to. This is putting a huge strain on the system, with some people having to wait years for the help they need. The figures were obtained by BBC News through a Freedom of Information request to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. They show that the number of requests for care has increased by 20% in the past four years, while the number of people receiving help has only increased by 5%. This means that councils are now rejecting two-thirds of requests for care. The vast majority of requests for care come from older people, who need help with things like washing, dressing and eating. But councils are also seeing an increasing number of requests from younger people, who may have disabilities or mental health problems. The Local Government Association said the figures were ""deeply concerning"". ""Councils are facing an impossible task in trying to meet the growing demand for care,"" said David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board. ""We need the government to urgently provide us with more resources to help us meet this demand."" The government has said it is committed to providing more funding for social care, but it has not yet said how much this will be. In the meantime, councils are having to make difficult decisions about who to provide care for. This is often a matter of life and death, as people who are not receiving the care they need are more likely to end up in hospital or even die. The BBC has spoken to a number of people who have been refused care by their council. One is a 65-year-old woman with dementia who lives alone. She needs help with washing, dressing and eating, but her council has told her that she is not eligible for care. Another is a 40-year-old man who has a learning disability. He needs help with managing his finances and finding work, but his council has told him that he is not eligible for care. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs care receives it. But the figures obtained by BBC News suggest that this is not happening.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Japan frees Chinese boat captain amid diplomatic row,"Japan had accused Zhan Qixiong of deliberately ramming two patrol vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. China said his detention was ""illegal and invalid"", and cut off ministerial-level contacts with Japan. The release came after four tense months of heightened diplomatic tensions. The captain's release came after a Japanese court rejected a request to extend his detention without charge and ordered his immediate release. Zhan Qixiong returned to China, where he was greeted as a hero by Chinese officials and the media. The incident that led to the captain's arrest took place near the Senkaku Islands, which are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. The islands are known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. Both countries have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the islands for decades. The dispute over the islands is a major source of tension between Japan and China. In recent years, there have been frequent incidents involving Chinese fishing vessels and Japanese patrol boats in the area. The release of Zhan Qixiong is likely to ease tensions between the two countries, but the underlying dispute over the islands remains unresolved. The release of Zhan Qixiong has been met with mixed reactions in Japan. Some people have welcomed the move, arguing that it will help to improve relations between Japan and China. Others have criticized the government for releasing the captain, arguing that he should have been prosecuted for his alleged crimes. The Japanese government has said that it will continue to work with China to resolve the dispute over the Senkaku Islands. However, it is clear that the issue will continue to be a source of tension between the two countries for the foreseeable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Solar Impulse aeroplane reaches Ohio,"The zero-fuel aircraft arrived in Dayton at 21:56 local time (01:56 GMT) having flown from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 1,113km journey took pilot Andre Borschberg about 16 hours to complete, a relatively short hop for the aircraft that has already covered more than 35,000km on its round-the-world journey. The aircraft is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells, which charge batteries that drive the propellers. It has a wingspan of 72m (236ft) - wider than a Boeing 747 - but weighs only 2,300kg (5,100lb) - less than a family car. The plane's progress has been delayed by bad weather and technical problems, but the team is now hoping to complete the circumnavigation by the end of July. The aircraft is scheduled to make its next stop in Pennsylvania, before crossing the Atlantic to Europe. If successful, it will be the first time a solar-powered aircraft has flown around the world. The plane's journey has been closely followed by environmentalists, who see it as a symbol of the potential for renewable energy. The aircraft's success could help to inspire the development of new technologies that could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, some critics have questioned the environmental benefits of the aircraft, arguing that it is too expensive and impractical to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels. They also point out that the aircraft's batteries are made from lithium, which is a finite resource. Despite the criticism, the Solar Impulse team remains confident that the aircraft can make a significant contribution to the fight against climate change. The team hopes that the aircraft's success will inspire people to think differently about energy and encourage them to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Virgin's Unity plane rockets skyward,"By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent Chief pilot, Scotsman Dave Mackay, and co-pilot, American Mike Masucci, took the vehicle to almost 89km (55 miles) during a four-hour flight. It was the first of five powered test flights planned over the next few months. ""It was the most exhilarating moment of my career,"" Mike Masucci said. ""We've just changed the world,"" Dave Mackay commented. Virgin Orbit is the brainchild of Sir Richard Branson who says the goal is to ""open up space for business"". His company is a relative latecomer to the emerging small satellite launch market. But it has the backing of big money investors and is also aiming to bring down the cost of access to orbit. ""We're committed to making this a routine service,"" said Will Pomerantz, the Virgin Orbit chief technology officer. ""Our plan is to fly every month; there's a huge market for this."" The launches will be conducted from various locations around the world, depending on the needs of the customers. The LauncherOne rocket is carried aloft under the wing of a specially modified Boeing 747 aircraft. Once the plane reaches the appropriate altitude and position, the rocket is released and fires its engine to propel itself and its payload into orbit. This ""air-launch"" system is less expensive than the more traditional method of launching rockets from a ground-based pad. Virgin Orbit says it can provide flexible and responsive launch services, putting satellites into orbits ranging from a few hundred kilometres up to 5,000km in altitude. The company is also developing a reusable first stage for its LauncherOne, which will further reduce the cost of operations. ""We're at the very beginning of a new era in space launch,"" said George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit. ""The key is to reduce the cost of launching small satellites into orbit. That's what will open up the market to new technologies and applications.""

Steve Easterbrook's new McJob,"By Jamie Robertson Presenter, BBC World News The former Watford Grammar School boy is seen as the man who revitalised the group's UK business. And McDonald's needs a turnaround specialist as it struggles with its image, assailed by criticism over everything from its food to its role in creating obesity and paying low wages. Steve Easterbrook says he's not concerned about the naysayers. He told me that he's a ""big believer"" in the power of the McDonald's brand. ""It's one of the most recognised brands in the world,"" he said. ""And it's a brand that people have a lot of emotional attachment to."" Easterbrook says he's going to focus on improving the quality of the food, making the restaurants more welcoming, and providing better customer service. He also wants to make the company more environmentally friendly. But it won't be easy. McDonald's is facing competition from a growing number of fast-food chains, and it's also struggling with changing consumer tastes. People are increasingly looking for healthier, more sustainable food options. Easterbrook is aware of the challenges, but he's confident that he can turn things around. He says he's a ""results-oriented person"" and he's not afraid to make tough decisions. ""I'm not here to tinker around the edges,"" he said. ""I'm here to make a difference."" Only time will tell if Easterbrook can deliver on his promises. But he's certainly not short of ambition. He wants to make McDonald's the ""world's best quick-service restaurant"". If he succeeds, it will be a remarkable turnaround for a company that has been struggling for years. But if he fails, it will be another nail in the coffin for one of the world's most iconic brands. Steve Easterbrook has also pledged to improve McDonald's UK operations, saying he wants to make the company ""the best place to eat and work"" in the country.

Church of England to keep Amazon shares despite Welby criticism,"The Church Times has revealed Amazon was among the 20 biggest global investments by the Church last year. A statement from the CofE said it considered ""a range of factors"" in its investment decisions, including companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. The Church's ethical investment policy is designed to ""promote the flourishing of all creation and the common good,"" a spokesperson said. ""This includes investing in companies that are committed to reducing their carbon footprint, respecting human rights, and promoting economic justice."" Amazon has been criticized by some for its labor practices, environmental record, and tax avoidance strategies. However, the Church said it believes that ""engaging with companies"" is the best way to encourage them to improve their ESG performance. ""We believe that by investing in companies like Amazon, we can have a positive impact on their behavior and encourage them to make changes that will benefit all of society,"" the spokesperson said. The Church's decision to keep Amazon shares has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the Church for its ethical stance, while others have accused it of hypocrisy. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has previously criticized Amazon for its labor practices. In 2018, he said that the company's ""ruthless"" treatment of its workers was ""a scandal."" However, the Church said that it is ""confident"" that Amazon is committed to improving its ESG performance. ""We will continue to monitor the company's progress and engage with them on issues of concern,"" the spokesperson said. The Church of England is one of the world's largest investors, with a portfolio worth around £10 billion. It has been investing in ethical funds since the 1980s. In recent years, the Church has come under increasing pressure to divest from companies that are involved in activities that are harmful to the environment or society.

UK unemployment rises to 1.7m,"That is the first increase since the May-July period of last year. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1%, which is still near historic lows. However, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by 10,400 to 1.2 million. The rise in unemployment was driven by a fall in the number of people in employment, which decreased by 56,000 to 32.5 million. This was the first quarterly fall in employment since the three months to May 2020. The number of people economically inactive, which includes those who are not working and not looking for work, increased by 25,000 to 8.9 million. This was driven by an increase in the number of people looking after family or home, which rose by 44,000 to 1.4 million. The latest figures come as the UK economy faces a number of challenges, including rising inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank of England has raised interest rates to try to curb inflation, but this is also expected to slow economic growth. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said that the government was ""monitoring the situation closely"" and was ""committed to supporting people through this challenging period."" He said that the government would ""continue to provide targeted support to those most in need, and help people into work."" The TUC General Secretary, Frances O'Grady, said that the rise in unemployment was ""a worrying sign"" that the UK economy was ""heading in the wrong direction."" She said that the government needed to ""do more to support people who are losing their jobs"" and to ""boost the economy."" The CBI Director-General, Tony Danker, said that the rise in unemployment was ""a reminder that the cost of living crisis is having a real impact on businesses and individuals.""

""I know what I'm supposed to do for crowd control, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do for a bomb attack.""

Why are young Indians killing themselves?,"Soutik Biswas Delhi correspondent If new research is to be believed, a disturbingly high number of young Indians are losing the courage to live. A study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal finds that suicide is the leading cause of death among 15 to 19-year-olds in India. In 2016, an estimated 25,000 children and teenagers died by suicide in India. That's more than the number of people who died in road accidents in the same year. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bengaluru, found that the suicide rate among young Indians has been increasing steadily over the past decade. In 2001, the suicide rate among 15 to 19-year-olds was 8.8 per 100,000. By 2016, it had increased to 15.3 per 100,000. The researchers found that there are a number of factors that are contributing to the high suicide rate among young Indians. These include: Academic pressure: Indian students are under a lot of pressure to succeed in school. They are often expected to get good grades in order to get into a good college and get a good job. This pressure can lead to anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Family problems: Many young Indians experience family problems, such as divorce, domestic violence, and financial difficulties. These problems can also lead to anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Social isolation: Young Indians who feel isolated and alone are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts. This can be due to a number of factors, such as bullying, cyberbullying, and discrimination. Mental health problems: Young Indians who have mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, are at an increased risk of suicide. The study's authors say that the high suicide rate among young Indians is a serious public health problem. They call for more research to be done on the causes of suicide among young Indians and for more effective suicide prevention programs to be developed.

"Volkswagen's UK sales fell in October, says SMMT","The motor group has been embroiled in controversy over the level of emissions from its diesel and petrol cars. Sales of VW branded cars fell 9.8%, Skoda dropped 3% and SEAT was down 8.3%. The figures show that registrations of new cars dropped for the third month in a row in October, down 1.7% compared with the same month last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Overall, diesel cars accounted for just over half of all new vehicles, down from 53% a year ago. The number of petrol cars registered rose 4.3%, while demand for hybrid and electric models increased 17.7%. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""October's figures continue the recent trend of a slowing new car market, with consumer and business confidence hit by a range of factors. ""These include ongoing economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and high fuel prices."" The drop in VW sales comes as the German automaker faces a barrage of lawsuits and investigations over its use of emissions-cheating devices in its diesel cars. The company has admitted to installing software in millions of vehicles that allowed them to pass emissions tests, even though they emitted far more pollutants than allowed under the law. The scandal has damaged VW's reputation and led to a sharp decline in sales. In the UK, VW sales fell 20% in 2016, the biggest drop of any major automaker. In addition to the emissions scandal, VW is also facing challenges due to Brexit. The company has warned that a no-deal Brexit would disrupt its supply chain and could lead to job losses in the UK. Despite the challenges, VW remains one of the largest automakers in the world. The company is investing heavily in new technology, including electric vehicles and autonomous driving. VW is also hoping to rebuild its reputation by investing in sustainability and social responsibility.

India raises withdrawal limit as rupee anger mounts,"Customers can now withdraw up to 2,500 rupees a day from cash machines, rather than 2,000, the finance ministry said. Many cash machines are not working because they have run out of money. The move comes after days of protests across India over the government's shock decision to ban high-denomination banknotes. The ban has caused chaos for ordinary Indians, who rely on cash for most transactions. Long queues have formed outside banks as people try to exchange their old banknotes for new ones. Some people have been forced to sleep on the streets overnight to secure a place in the queue. The government has said that the ban is necessary to combat corruption and tax evasion. However, critics say that it is causing more harm than good. The opposition Congress party has called for the government to reconsider the ban, saying that it is punishing ordinary Indians for the crimes of a few. The government has also been criticized for not doing enough to prepare for the ban. Many banks have not been able to cope with the demand for new banknotes, and there have been reports of cash machines being empty. The central bank has said that it is working to improve the situation. However, it is likely to take some time for the cash shortage to ease. In the meantime, the government has urged people to use electronic payments instead of cash. However, many people in India do not have access to electronic payment systems. The ban on high-denomination banknotes has also had a negative impact on the Indian economy. Businesses have reported a sharp decline in sales, and some factories have been forced to close. The government has said that it is committed to supporting the economy during this difficult time.

"Objective reality exists, says UK minister Matt Hancock","By Brian Wheeler Political reporter Matt Hancock said it was ""something of a disappointment"" that he had to state publicly that ""objective reality exists"". But it was ""incredibly important"" to hang on to that principle in the face of ""post-truth"" and ""alternative facts"". The health secretary made his comments in an article for The Times Red Box. In it, he said: ""The very idea that objective reality may not exist is not only dangerous but also self-defeating. ""If we cannot agree on what is true, how can we possibly hope to make progress on anything? ""Whether it's climate change, the economy or even just the day-to-day decisions we make in our own lives, we need to be able to rely on a shared understanding of the world around us."" Hancock said that the rise of social media had made it easier for people to live in ""echo chambers"", where they only encounter views that they agree with. This, he said, had led to a ""fragmentation of our society"" and made it harder to have ""meaningful conversations"" about important issues. He called on people to ""be more open to hearing different perspectives"" and to ""challenge our own beliefs"" from time to time. ""It's not always easy, but it's essential if we want to live in a society where we can all understand each other,"" he said. Hancock's comments come at a time when there is growing concern about the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. A recent study by the University of Oxford found that people are more likely to believe false information if they see it shared by their friends and family on social media.

The Tunisian interior ministry official said that Rezgui had been in contact with the two men who attacked the Bardo National Museum in Tunis in March, killing 22 people. The official said that the three men had been in contact with IS militants in Libya. The IS group has claimed responsibility for both the Bardo and Sousse attacks. The Tunisian government has declared a state of emergency and has vowed to crack down on terrorism. The government has also said that it will investigate how Rezgui was able to travel to Libya and return to Tunisia without being detected by security forces. The UK Foreign Office has warned British nationals against travelling to Tunisia. The Foreign Office has said that there is a high threat of terrorism in Tunisia and that British nationals should be aware of the risks of travelling to the country. The Sousse attack has raised concerns about the threat of terrorism in Tunisia and the wider region. The attack has also raised questions about the ability of the Tunisian government to protect its citizens from terrorism. The Tunisian government has said that it is committed to fighting terrorism and that it will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens. The government has also said that it will work with the international community to combat terrorism. The Sousse attack is a reminder of the threat of terrorism in North Africa and the wider region. The attack has also highlighted the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lend Lease chosen to build Wrexham super-prison,"Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said the project would be a ""massive boost"" for the local economy with half of the jobs available going to local people. Work is expected to start in August, creating around 1,000 jobs during construction. The prison is due to open in 2022 and will house 2,106 male prisoners. It will be the first new prison to be built in Wales since HMP Berwyn opened in Wrexham in 2017. Lend Lease has been chosen to build the prison after a competitive tender process. The company has a track record of delivering major infrastructure projects, including the Olympic Village for the London 2012 Games and the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The prison will be built on a 130-acre site on Wrexham Industrial Estate. It will be a Category C prison, which means it will house prisoners who are assessed as being at a low risk of re-offending. The prison will have a range of facilities, including workshops, a gym, a library, and a healthcare centre. It will also have a dedicated unit for prisoners with mental health problems. The Ministry of Justice said the new prison is needed to help reduce overcrowding in the prison system. The prison population in England and Wales has been rising for a number of years and is now at its highest level since the early 1990s. The new prison will also help to create jobs and boost the local economy. Lend Lease has pledged to use local suppliers and contractors wherever possible. The project has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said the prison would be a ""major investment"" in the area. ""This is a great opportunity for Wrexham,"" he said. ""It will create jobs, boost the economy, and help to reduce overcrowding in the prison system."" Wrexham County Borough Council leader Mark Pritchard said the prison would be a ""positive development"" for the area. ""This is a major investment in Wrexham and will help to create jobs and boost the local economy,"" he said. ""We are pleased to be working with Lend Lease on this project and look forward to seeing the prison open in 2022.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Fear suppressing neurons found,"By Melissa Hogenboom Science reporter, BBC Radio Science These inhibitory neurons ensure that a neutral memory of a context or location is not contaminated by an unpleasant event occurring at the same time. The team says their work could help to explain why sometimes people have difficulty forgetting traumatic experiences. The research is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. ""We can all recall a time when we experienced something unpleasant, like a bad meal or a car accident,"" said Dr Andrea Lobo, from the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. ""Normally, we would remember that experience as being associated with that place or time, but in some cases, that link can become too strong and we end up associating the place or time with the negative experience, even when we are not there. ""This is what happens in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), when people have flashbacks and nightmares about a traumatic event."" The team wanted to understand how the brain prevents this from happening normally. They used optogenetics, a technique that allows them to control the activity of specific neurons using light, to inhibit a type of neuron in the hippocampus of mice. The hippocampus is a brain region involved in memory formation. They found that inhibiting these neurons caused the mice to associate a neutral place with an unpleasant experience, even though they were not in that place at the time. ""This suggests that these neurons are normally responsible for preventing us from making these kinds of incorrect associations,"" said Dr Lobo. ""Our findings could help to explain why some people have difficulty forgetting traumatic experiences. In these people, these inhibitory neurons may not be working properly, which could lead to the development of PTSD."" The team now hopes to investigate whether these neurons are also involved in other memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. ""We know that memory loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but we don't know exactly what causes it,"" said Dr Lobo. ""It's possible that these inhibitory neurons could be involved, so we want to investigate this further.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Global dip in renewable energy investment,"By Mark Kinver Environment reporter, BBC News It said investment fell for the second year in a row because of cheaper technology, but also as a result of uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report, from the UN Environment Programme and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, found that 65% of global renewable energy markets are now cost-competitive compared with fossil fuels. This has caused a sharp fall in investment in new projects, particularly wind and solar, which have become less profitable. But concerns over energy security and the need to tackle the climate crisis have led analysts to warn that clean energy investment needs to be ramped up, not reduced. ""In the midst of a global energy crisis and climate emergency, new investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is simply out of step with reality,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP. ""We need to move towards a new energy economy that is more equitable and sustainable."" The report found that investment in renewable energy in China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, fell by 17% in 2022 to $92.6bn. This is due in part to the country's zero-Covid policy, which has disrupted supply chains. But investment also fell in Europe, the second largest market, by 24% to $55.6bn. This is due to the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has made energy prices more volatile and created economic uncertainty. The US, however, bucked the trend, with investment in renewable energy increasing by 31% to $65.5bn. This is due in part to the Biden administration's support for clean energy, as well as the growing demand for electricity from renewable sources. Despite the overall decline in investment, the report found that the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is still growing. In 2022, renewable energy accounted for 29% of global electricity generation, up from 26% in 2021. This is due in part to the falling cost of renewable energy technology, as well as the increasing demand for clean energy from businesses and consumers. The report's authors said that the world is still on track to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But they warned that investment in renewable energy needs to be accelerated in order to meet these goals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
British bluebells 'have advantage over Spanish bluebells',"By Helen Briggs BBC News The introduced Spanish variety has lower fertility and is unlikely to wipe out the native plant, according to genetic tests. The Spanish bluebell has been spreading rapidly across the UK, particularly in woodlands. It has larger blue flowers than the native bluebell and flowers around two weeks earlier. Some experts have expressed concern that the Spanish bluebell could eventually outcompete the native plant. However, the new research suggests that the native bluebell has a significant advantage. The scientists compared the fertility of the two species in the laboratory. They found that the Spanish bluebell produced fewer seeds than the native bluebell. They also found that the Spanish bluebell seeds were less likely to germinate and grow into seedlings. The researchers say that their findings suggest that the native bluebell is unlikely to be wiped out by the Spanish bluebell. ""Our results suggest that the native bluebell is likely to be able to persist alongside the Spanish bluebell,"" said Dr. Richard Ennos, one of the researchers from the University of Edinburgh. ""This is good news, as the native bluebell is an important part of our natural heritage."" The researchers say that their findings do not mean that the Spanish bluebell is not a threat to the native plant. They say that the Spanish bluebell could still have a negative impact on the native bluebell population, for example by reducing the number of pollinators available to the native plant. However, the researchers say that their findings do provide some reassurance that the native bluebell is not likely to be wiped out by the Spanish bluebell.

UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan,"The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers more than £85m. That included £78m for two vessels that were never used and remain tied up in Belfast Lough. The Department for Transport (DfT) told the National Audit Office (NAO) it chartered the ferries ""to provide additional resilience"" in case there was disruption at Channel crossings after Brexit. But the NAO said there was a ""lack of clarity"" about what resilience meant and whether the procurement process represented value for money for the taxpayer. The report also found that the DfT had not put enough effort into considering how the ferries would be used, which led to delays and inefficiencies. For example, the DfT had not considered whether the ferries would need to be modified to meet UK regulations, which delayed their deployment. The NAO said the DfT had now taken steps to improve its ferry procurement process, but it said there was ""more to do"" to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. The DfT said it was ""disappointed"" with the NAO's findings, but it accepted the recommendations and was working to implement them. The department said it had ""learned lessons"" from the ferry procurement process and was ""confident"" that it would be better prepared for any future no-deal Brexit. The NAO's report comes as the UK government is preparing for the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. The government has said it will ""do everything necessary"" to ensure that the UK is ready for a no-deal Brexit, including chartering additional ferries. However, the NAO's report suggests that the government may need to do more to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent wisely on Brexit preparations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sugababe changes 'hard on Amelle',"By Natalie Jamieson Newsbeat entertainment reporter It was announced on the band's website that 25-year-old Amelle would be taking time out at the end of the girls' current Get Sexy tour for personal reasons. Jade, Keisha and Heidi say they ""completely support her decision"". But Amelle's decision to take time out has made me think - is she going to be back? Could this be the first step towards the end of the Sugababes? They're one of the most successful girl bands ever. They've had a string of hits since they first got together in 1998. But they've had their troubles over the years. Mutya Buena left in 2005. Then Heidi Range took over from her. Amelle replaced Keisha in 2009. And now Amelle's decided to step away. I've spoken to some of the fans who've been following the Sugababes' career for years. Amelle is the fourth different member who's sung on their songs. ""It's just a bit weird,"" said 16-year-old Charlotte. ""I feel like I've got to learn new names and faces all the time."" Another fan, Lucy, said: ""It's not fair on the fans to keep changing the line-up."" But despite the changes, the Sugababes have kept going and have had plenty of hit records. ""They've always managed to reinvent themselves, so I'm sure they'll be fine,"" said one fan called James. However, I don't think it's as simple as that. I think the Sugababes are at a crossroads. If Amelle does decide to leave, it could be the end of the band as we know it. The other girls could try to find another replacement. But would it be the same? Or they could decide to call it a day. Whatever happens, I think it's fair to say that the Sugababes will never be quite the same again. Here are some of the reactions from fans on Twitter and Facebook: ""I'm so disappointed that Amelle is taking time out from the Sugababes. I hope she comes back soon."" - @Sugababesfan ""I'm not surprised that Amelle is taking time out. The band has been through a lot of changes in recent years."" - @Sugababesfan2 ""I think the Sugababes are at a crossroads.

Carney says house price boom is 'manageable',"He said the bank is acting in a ""graduated and proportionate way"" to stop the housing market getting out of control. He told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the strength of the recovery has taken the MPC by surprise, but added that most of the data suggest the economy is expanding ""close to its sustainable rate"". Carney also said the bank would keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% as long as inflation remained in check, below the bank's target of 2%. Economists are divided over whether the rise in house prices is sustainable. Some say the prices are being driven up by investors from abroad, and that prices are likely to fall in the next few months. Others say that the strong economic recovery will continue to support demand for housing, and that prices will continue to rise. The Bank of England has been criticised for its handling of the housing market. Some critics have accused the bank of doing too little to prevent a unsustainable rise in house prices. Others have said that the bank should not interfere in the housing market at all. Carney's comments come as the latest official figures show that house prices in the UK rose by 10.2% in the year to March, the biggest annual increase since August 2010. The average house price is now £223,000. The rise in house prices has been fuelled by a number of factors, including low interest rates, a shortage of new homes, and a strong economic recovery. However, there are concerns that the rise in house prices is unsustainable, and that a sharp correction could lead to a slowdown in the economy. The Bank of England has said it is monitoring the housing market closely, and that it will take action if it believes that the market is getting out of control.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Asbestos: Cwmcarn High School could reopen after scare,"Cwmcarn High School in Caerphilly county closed in October after a report said asbestos posed a threat to health. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is an ""essentially uncontaminated school"" after new tests. A section of the school's roof was replaced over the weekend, and air tests on Monday came back clear. The school will now reopen on Tuesday with the HSE confirming that the school is safe. Caerphilly council said it had worked ""tirelessly"" to reopen the school as soon as possible. The council said: ""The school will be open as normal for pupils and staff to return to on Tuesday, January 16th. ""We would like to thank all parents, pupils, and staff for their patience and understanding during this time."" The news comes as a relief to parents and pupils who have been forced to travel to other schools since Cwmcarn High closed. One parent, who did not want to be named, said: ""It's great news that the school is reopening. My son has been having to travel to another school and it's been a nightmare. ""I'm just glad that it's all sorted out now and he can go back to his own school."" The HSE said it had carried out a number of tests at the school and found that there was no asbestos contamination. A spokesman said: ""The HSE has completed a number of air tests at Cwmcarn High School and the results have come back clear. ""We are satisfied that the school is an essentially uncontaminated school and that it is safe for pupils and staff to return."" The council said it would continue to work with the HSE to ensure that the school remains safe.

US slavery: How is America marking the 400th anniversary?,"Why is the date significant? In 1619, a ship arrived in an English settlement in what is now the US state of Virginia, carrying some 20 captured Africans. It's the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans in what would become the United States. The 1619 Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning initiative from The New York Times Magazine, has drawn attention to the lasting impact of slavery in the US. It has argued that the country's history has been shaped by slavery and its legacy in ways that are often overlooked. To mark the 400th anniversary, a number of events and initiatives have been planned. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is hosting a year-long exhibition entitled 'Slavery and Freedom'. The exhibition tells the story of slavery in the US from its beginnings to the present day. Other events include a national day of remembrance on August 20, the date when the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia. There will also be a series of lectures, workshops, and community events. The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the US is an important opportunity to reflect on the country's history and the legacy of slavery. It is a chance to learn from the past and to work towards a more just and equitable future. Here are some additional perspectives on the 400th anniversary: Ibram X. Kendi, author of 'How to Be an Antiracist': ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to reflect on the deep and enduring legacy of slavery in our country. It is a time to recommit ourselves to the fight for racial justice and to create a more just and equitable society for all."" Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of 'The 1619 Project': ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to remember the millions of people who were enslaved, the brutality they endured, and the lasting legacy of slavery. It is also a time to celebrate the resilience of the African American community and the progress we have made towards racial justice."" Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative: ""The 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans in the United States is a time to confront the dark chapters of our history and to recommit ourselves to the pursuit of justice. It is a time to remember the victims of slavery and to work towards a day when all Americans are treated with dignity and respect.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The Prodigy and Slash top Friday Download Festival bill,"By Del Crookes Newsbeat reporter at Download Festival The dance band were 20 minutes late for their set but made up for it with more than an hour of their infectious beats and wild stage show. Fireworks exploded, dancers in animal costumes roamed the stage and frontman Keith Flint showed off his trademark wild hair during tracks such as Breathe and Firestarter. But it was the rockers who seemed to be the favourites of the Friday night crowd - whether it was US band Stone Sour, Welsh rockers Bullet For My Valentine or Los Angeles metallers Slipknot. Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor wore full make-up and sang and screamed his way through the likes of Get Inside and Through Glass. He even jumped down into the crowd and walked across the barrier at one point. Bullet For My Valentine sang about tears, pain and anger - but got the whole crowd moving with tracks like Your Betrayal, Tears Don't Fall and Scream Aim Fire. As night fell, Slipknot took to the stage in their trademark masks. The crowd went wild for Duality, Psychosocial and Wait And Bleed during a hard-hitting set featuring smoke, flames and a giant stage show. Frontman Corey Taylor said the crowd had been ""f awesome"". ""There's fans out there that know the lyrics better than we do, they sing the songs louder than we do and there's nothing more beautiful,"" he said. ""We are Slipknot, you are our family and we love you."" The day had begun with the return of thrash metal legends Megadeth. They played a crowd-pleasing set featuring Hangar 18, Symphony of Destruction and Holy Wars.

Redcar Regent Cinema demolition inspires memory 'flood',"Redcar's Regent Cinema opened as a music hall, the Pavilion, in 1928, and was where Larry Grayson, performing under stage name Billy Breen, coined his ""shut that door"" catchphrase. It closed in 1989, and the memories of its halcyon days flooded back to many as demolition work began this week. Photos from the cinema's heyday show a glamorous main entrance with staff in smart uniforms greeting filmgoers. Michael Grainge, who lives in Redcar, was nine when he first visited in 1967. ""I can remember the Central Cafe next door and the old-fashioned bar where you could get lemonade and a packet of crisps,"" he said. ""I think they sold ice cream during the intervals but you had to have a dish with an ice cream wafer in it."" His memories, he said, ""came flooding back"" on Monday when he visited the former building. Others shared their memories on social media after seeing the work begin on Monday. ""I can remember sitting on my dad's knee, he would normally fall asleep and I would get away with eating the whole box of chocolates,"" said one. ""My ex-husband worked there when he was at school, he said the boxes full of film canisters were huge and he would try and stand in them,"" said another. It held 2,200 people in its prime and was also used to host bingo, dances and concerts. Dave Robb, 63, said he saw everyone from Showaddywaddy to Chas and Dave perform there. ""I have seen films with mates and taken my kids when they were young,"" he said. ""It was part of the area's history and culture - it's sad to see it go.""

We know there is more to do and we're committed to emerging from this crisis as a stronger and more sustainable business, but right now our focus is on making the right decisions to protect as many jobs as possible in the future."" It comes after airports across the UK have been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of passengers flying plummeting. MAG had already announced plans to cut 1,250 jobs in August, and it has now confirmed that the majority of those roles will be lost. The group said it ""will explore all possible options"" to avoid compulsory redundancies and said it was ""committed to supporting all affected colleagues"".

Falkirk vote-rigging claims: Jack Straw calls for new inquiry,"On BBC2's Daily Politics, the Labour MP said there was ""a sufficient case... for there to be further questions that will need to be dealt with"".

Unite has said it ""provided the Labour Party with all the information that was available to us"" and that it ""has never sought to influence the outcome of any investigation"". The Labour Party has said it will ""co-operate fully"" with the Electoral Commission's investigation. The allegations of vote-rigging centre on the Falkirk constituency, where Unite was accused of signing up hundreds of new members in order to influence the selection of the Labour candidate. The party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has already suspended three members in connection with the allegations. The Electoral Commission has said it will ""consider whether there are grounds for a full investigation"". The allegations have come at a difficult time for the Labour Party, which is already facing questions about its links to trade unions. The party has been accused of being too close to the unions, and of allowing them to have too much influence over its policies and decision-making. The allegations of vote-rigging have further damaged the party's reputation and raised questions about its ability to run a fair and democratic selection process. The party is now under pressure to act decisively to deal with the allegations and to restore confidence in its ability to run a fair and democratic selection process. If the allegations are proven to be true, it could have serious consequences for the Labour Party. The party could be fined or even suspended from taking part in elections. The allegations could also lead to a loss of confidence in the party from the public. The party is already facing a challenge from the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the allegations of vote-rigging could make it even more difficult for the party to win back voters in Scotland.

The final death toll announced by the Metropolitan Police on 13 July marks a somber and tragic milestone in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. Each life lost represents an irreplaceable member of the community. As the families and loved ones of the victims continue to mourn, the outpouring of support and solidarity has been overwhelming. Vigils, fundraisers, and community events have been organized to honor those who perished and provide comfort to the bereaved. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the focus is now on ensuring that the victims are not forgotten and that their legacy lives on. One way of doing this is through the creation of a permanent memorial to remember those who lost their lives. In addition, there is a need for a thorough review of building regulations and fire safety measures to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. The Grenfell Tower fire has exposed vulnerabilities in the system, and it is essential that lessons are learned and changes are made to enhance the safety of high-rise buildings. The road to recovery for the Grenfell Tower community will be long and challenging. However, the collective efforts of the community, local authorities, and the wider society will be crucial in supporting the survivors and ensuring that the victims are remembered with dignity and respect. The Grenfell Tower fire has had a profound impact on the lives of countless people. It has shattered families, destroyed homes, and left a deep scar on the community.

Female Islamic clerics in Indonesia issue rare child marriage fatwa,"The fatwa, which is not legally binding but will be influential, was issued after a three-day congress of female clerics in the country. The clerics urged the government to raise the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 16 to 18, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Indonesia has ratified. Child marriage is a serious problem in Indonesia, with an estimated 1.2 million girls married before the age of 18. The practice is particularly prevalent in rural areas and among poor families. Child marriage has a number of negative consequences for girls, including increased risk of dropping out of school, domestic violence, and early pregnancy. The fatwa issued by the female clerics is a significant step towards addressing the problem of child marriage in Indonesia. The fatwa states that child marriage is ""haram"" (forbidden) under Islamic law, and that it should be abolished. The fatwa also urges the government to take steps to prevent child marriage, such as raising the legal age of marriage and providing education on the harmful effects of child marriage. The fatwa has been welcomed by many human rights activists and child protection organizations. However, it is likely to face opposition from conservative religious groups, who argue that child marriage is permitted under Islamic law. The Indonesian government has not yet responded to the fatwa. However, the government has previously indicated that it is committed to addressing the problem of child marriage. In 2019, the government launched a national strategy to end child marriage by 2030. The fatwa issued by the female clerics is a significant step towards ending child marriage in Indonesia. However, it is important to note that the fatwa is not legally binding, and that the government will need to take further steps to address the problem. The government should consider raising the legal age of marriage, providing education on the harmful effects of child marriage, and working with religious leaders to change attitudes towards child marriage.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The court heard how Niels H had killed two patients in his care at a hospital in Delmenhorst, near Bremen, in 2021. He injected one patient with a lethal dose of medication and suffocated the other with a pillow. He also attempted to kill a third patient, but the victim survived. Niels H was arrested shortly after the third incident. During his trial, Niels H admitted to the killings but claimed he had not planned them. He said he had been feeling overwhelmed and stressed at the time and had acted on impulse. However, the prosecution argued that Niels H had carefully planned the murders and had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"". In his closing statement, Niels H apologized for his actions and said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the pain he had caused. However, Judge Uebele said that Niels H's apology was ""too little, too late"" and that he had shown no genuine remorse for his crimes. The judge also said that Niels H's actions had ""shattered the trust"" between patients and healthcare professionals. ""You have destroyed the reputation of a noble profession,"" Judge Uebele said. ""You have shown yourself to be a danger to society and you deserve to spend the rest of your life in prison."" Niels H's life sentence means that he will not be eligible for parole for at least 15 years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Trump appoints China critic Peter Navarro to trade post,"He will lead the White House National Trade Council, and serve as director of trade and industrial policy. Mr Navarro advised Mr Trump during his election campaign, and is a prominent critic of China. Mr Navarro is the author of several books on trade and economics, including ""Death by China"" and ""The Coming China Wars."" In these books, he argues that China is a threat to the US economy and that the US needs to take steps to protect its workers and businesses. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to be seen as a sign that Mr Trump is serious about taking a tough line on trade with China. Mr Trump has already threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, and has said that he wants to renegotiate the trade deficit between the two countries. Mr Navarro's appointment is also likely to be seen as a sign that Mr Trump is willing to appoint people with strong views, even if those views are controversial. Mr Navarro is a vocal critic of the current global trading system, and he has advocated for a more protectionist approach. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to be welcomed by some businesses and workers in the US who believe that the US needs to take a tougher stance on trade with China. However, it is also likely to be met with criticism from free trade advocates, who argue that tariffs and other protectionist measures will harm the US economy. The appointment of Mr Navarro is the latest sign that Mr Trump is taking a different approach to trade policy than his predecessors. Mr Trump has already withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has threatened to renegotiate other trade agreements. It is unclear whether Mr Trump's approach will be successful, but it is clear that he is willing to try something new. Mr Navarro's appointment is likely to have a significant impact on US trade policy. He is a strong advocate for protectionism, and he is likely to push for policies that will benefit US businesses and workers. However, his appointment is also likely to be met with criticism from free trade advocates, who argue that tariffs and other protectionist measures will harm the US economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Five things Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley told Newsbeat,"By Jonathan BlakeNewsbeat politics reporter Speaking to Newsbeat at a rally in Bristol, Mr Bartley said voting for a smaller party like his ""sends a message"" that change to the political system is needed. He also said the time was right for new politics as neither the Conservative nor Labour governments had addressed the climate emergency and poverty. Here are five key things he told us: Voting Green is a vote for change: ""This election is an opportunity to change the political system in this country. It's a chance to end the dominance of the two old parties and bring in new ideas."" The government has failed on climate change: ""We are in an ecological emergency, a climate emergency and neither the Tories or Labour are doing enough. We need a Green New Deal to create a million green jobs and invest in a zero-carbon future."" The government has failed on poverty: ""Poverty has risen in this country under the Tories and Labour's policies haven't helped. We need a universal basic income to give everyone a safety net."" The Green Party is a progressive alternative: ""We are a party that believes in social justice, equality and environmental sustainability. We are a home for people who want to make a positive difference to the world."" The Green Party is growing: ""We are the fastest growing party in the UK. People are recognising that the old parties are not delivering and they are looking for a new alternative."" Mr Bartley's comments come as the Green Party is hoping to make gains in the general election. The party is currently polling at around 5% and is hoping to win its first ever MP. The Greens are standing candidates in 442 constituencies across the UK. The party's manifesto includes a pledge to invest £100bn in a Green New Deal, to introduce a universal basic income and to reduce child poverty by 50%. The general election takes place on 12 December.

Lowe said that Maldonado-Passage was ""not doing well"" at first but was now ""much better"". ""He's still very weak but he's getting better,"" Lowe said. ""He's eating and drinking and he's talking."" Maldonado-Passage's illness comes as the United States experiences a surge in Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, the country reported more than 250,000 new cases, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. The surge in cases has led to renewed calls for people to get vaccinated and boosted. Lowe said that Maldonado-Passage had not been vaccinated against Covid-19. ""He didn't believe in the vaccine,"" Lowe said. ""He thought it was a hoax.""

Apple and Amazon deny China hack claims,"Apple and Amazon have both responded publicly to claims made by Bloomberg Businessweek which described the cyber-attack. ""There is no truth to these claims,"" said Apple's spokesperson Fred Sainz. Amazon's spokesperson also denied the accusations, saying that the company ""has found no evidence to support this claim."" The original report, published on November 13th, 2022, alleged that hackers linked to the Chinese government had managed to implant malicious chips into Supermicro server motherboards. These chips, the report claimed, were designed to spy on the companies' internal networks and steal sensitive data. The report cited anonymous sources who claimed to have knowledge of the investigation into the hack. However, both Apple and Amazon have denied these claims, and no evidence has been presented to support them. The Chinese government has also denied any involvement in the hack. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said that the allegations were ""unfounded"" and ""irresponsible."" The claims made in the Bloomberg Businessweek report have been met with skepticism by some experts. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the report's claims were ""far-fetched."" ""There is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese hackers have implanted malicious chips into Supermicro server motherboards,"" Lewis said. ""This is a very serious accusation, and it would be irresponsible to make it without any evidence."" Other experts have also raised questions about the report's methodology. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said that the report relied too heavily on anonymous sources. ""The report does not provide any evidence to support its claims,"" Scott-Railton said. ""It is based entirely on anonymous sources, which makes it very difficult to verify."" The Bloomberg Businessweek report has sparked a great deal of concern and debate. However, it is important to note that the claims made in the report have not been substantiated by any evidence. Until more evidence is presented, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not the hack actually occurred.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Avocado prices at record high due to reduced harvests,"Avocado prices have risen to a record due to surging global demand and reduced harvests from major producers Mexico, Peru and California. A 10-kilogram box of Hass avocados from Mexico's major wholesale producer sells for around 530 pesos (£21.78; $30.22) - more than double last year's price. The global avocado market is worth an estimated $11 billion (£8.7bn), and Mexico is the world's largest producer, accounting for 60% of the global supply. However, in recent months, production in Mexico has been hit by a combination of factors, including drought, disease and organized crime. As a result, wholesale prices in Mexico have risen by more than 100% in the past year, and retail prices in the United States and Europe have also risen sharply. In the United Kingdom, a single avocado can now sell for as much as £2 in supermarkets, and some restaurants have even taken the fruit off their menus. The surge in prices has been particularly painful for countries like Mexico, where avocados are a staple food. In the Mexican state of Michoacan, which produces around 80% of the country's avocados, the avocado industry is worth an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.9bn) a year. However, as the avocado crisis continues, there are signs that the market may be starting to cool down. In recent weeks, wholesale prices in Mexico have started to decline slightly, and some analysts believe that the worst may be over. ""The market is starting to stabilize,"" said Juan Carlos Anaya, the head of the Mexican Avocado Producers and Packers Association. ""We're still facing a number of challenges, but we're confident that we'll be able to weather the storm."" For consumers, the high prices of avocados are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. However, there are some things you can do to save money. Buy avocados in bulk from a wholesaler or farmers market. Look for avocados that are slightly underripe and ripen them at home. Use avocados in recipes that call for small amounts, such as guacamole or avocado toast. Consider using other fruits, such as bananas or mangoes, as a substitute for avocados in some recipes.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
The new iPhone: Your Comments,"Apple shows off iPhone4 I will be buying one when my contract ends for my last iPhone. Why? Because with all this change in technology that is being created it will be nice to have a phone that can keep up with it all. I am a big fan of Apple products and have been for many years. Their products work well and fit into my lifestyle. I’m not really one who likes to constantly be buying a new phone because the technology is better. I like a phone that features all that I need and works well for me that is why sticking with Apple is really the best fit because of these reasons.  Some may say that the iPhone4 is not that different from the iPhone3 and that you really don’t need to upgrade. The look of the phone is different but the only major difference I see is the camera. The iPhone4 has a 5-megapixel camera compared to the iPhone3 3-megapixel. To some, this may not be a big difference but for the photos I take with my phone, this will make a big difference. I’m not one to carry around a camera and the quality of some of the pictures taken with the iPhone3 were not the best. Just the other day I was at my niece's dance recital and the pictures of her came out blurry because of the lighting. With the iPhone4 5-megapixel camera, I am hoping this will no longer be an issue. Also, with the iPhone4 featuring the front-facing camera this will come in handy as well. I can take self-portraits or use the FaceTime like my friend does. She loves the FaceTime feature because she gets to see her daughter while she is out of town. Even though the iPhone4 is a nice upgrade to the iPhone3 I still feel the price is a little high. I am still going to buy the iPhone4 but I am going to wait until my contract is up with my current iPhone3. My contract ends in October so I will be getting my iPhone4 then. In the meantime, I will continue to use my iPhone3 until then. I feel that getting the iPhone4 will be a great addition to my technological world and will be well worth the wait until my contract ends.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

World's biggest opera houses defend ENO after funding cuts,"They described the ENO as ""a showcase for talent and innovation"" and ""one of the UK's greatest cultural ambassadors"" in a letter to the Financial Times. Signatories included the general directors of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, La Scala in Milan, the Vienna State Opera, and the Paris Opera. The letter comes after the ENO announced plans to cut 20% of its workforce and close its London Coliseum base for two years as part of a major restructuring. The company said the cuts were necessary to secure its long-term financial future. However, the signatories of the letter argued that the cuts would have a devastating impact on the ENO and the wider opera world. They said the ENO was ""a vital part of the cultural landscape of the UK and beyond"" and that its closure would be ""a great loss to the arts community and to audiences around the world."" The letter also called on the UK government to provide more support for the ENO. They said the government had a ""responsibility to ensure that the UK's cultural institutions are able to thrive"" and that the cuts to the ENO were ""a short-sighted decision that will damage the UK's reputation as a cultural powerhouse."" The ENO is one of the UK's leading opera companies. It was founded in 1931 and has a long history of producing high-quality opera productions. The company has a strong track record of developing new talent and has been instrumental in the careers of many of the world's leading opera singers. The ENO's closure would be a major loss to the UK's cultural landscape. It would also have a negative impact on the wider opera world. The company is a major commissioner of new operas and its productions are often seen as a benchmark for quality. The UK government has a responsibility to ensure that the UK's cultural institutions are able to thrive.

Veterans' war memories given life in 'virtual' tour,"Poppyscotland has teamed up with games developers at Abertay University on the unusual Remembrance project. Headsets take users on a simulated tour of the Lady Haig poppy factory in Edinburgh where objects trigger a series of personal audio testimonies from veterans, providing a moving and immersive experience of their war memories. The project, called Poppy Stories, uses virtual reality (VR) technology to allow users to explore the factory and hear firsthand accounts from those who have served in the armed forces. The project was funded by Poppyscotland and developed in partnership with Abertay University. Users are given a headset and are taken on a simulated tour of the poppy factory. As they move around the factory, they can see objects that trigger a series of audio testimonies from veterans. The testimonies are personal and moving, and give users a unique insight into the experiences of those who have served. One veteran who took part in the project was Alistair Moffat, who served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He said: ""It was a great experience to be able to share my story with others in such a unique way. The VR technology really brought my memories to life and I hope that it will help people to understand the sacrifices that have been made by those who have served."" Another veteran who took part in the project was John Brown, who served in the Royal Navy during the Falklands War. He said: ""I was very impressed with the Poppy Stories project. It is a very immersive and powerful way to share the stories of veterans. I hope that it will help people to understand the challenges that veterans face when they return home from war."" The Poppy Stories project is a unique and moving way to commemorate Remembrance Day. It is a powerful reminder of the sacrifices that have been made by those who have served in the armed forces, and it gives users a unique insight into their experiences.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistan blasphemy: Gunman shoots accused dead in court,"By Secunder Kermani BBC News, Islamabad He had been facing charges for allegedly claiming to be a prophet. Blasphemy is legally punishable by death. Asif Mumtaz was shot dead in the courtroom as he spoke to the judge. The gunman ran toward him and fired three bullets into his chest. Others tried to restrain the attacker, who fired his weapon again, while Mr. Mumtaz lay on the floor, motionless. Wearing a white shalwar kameez and a white hat, the assailant was apprehended after police arrived and used tear gas to disperse the courtroom. Mr. Mumtaz was a manager at the company in Rawalpindi, where he had a reputation for being a quiet and decent man. But in recent months, he had been accused of sending blasphemous messages on WhatsApp, and video clips emerged of him purportedly claiming to be a prophet. Though Mr. Mumtaz had denied the allegations, he was arrested in August. His case had caught the attention of extremist religious groups. As the trial began, activists from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party gathered outside the court complex. They had threatened to launch a protest movement if Mr. Mumtaz was released. The TLP is a far-right group that has often taken up cases involving blasphemy. Its supporters often use violence and intimidation to try to influence the courts and punish those accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The Interior Minister, Rana Sanaullah, said the shooter was a ""terrorist,"" and an investigation had been launched to determine if he had any accomplices. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of those accused of blasphemy in Pakistan and the potential for mob justice. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue, and anyone accused of it can face threats from religious extremists. Often, cases are based on flimsy evidence, and accusations can be used to settle personal scores. In 2022, a Christian man was killed by a mob after he was accused of ripping pages from a Quran. In another case, a university student was sentenced to death for allegedly posting blasphemous content online. The government has condemned the killing of Mr. Mumtaz and has vowed to take action against those responsible. However, human rights groups say that more needs to be done to address the issue of blasphemy and protect those accused of it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Arson arrest of boy, 15, as dogs killed in Manchester kennels fire","Police said the number of animals that have died is expected to rise. Four crews were at the scene of the blaze, which broke out at about 19:00 BST in Ashton, Tameside. Greater Manchester Police said a 15-year-old boy had been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. He remains in custody for questioning. Residents told the BBC they had heard ""loads of bangs"" and seen flames shooting 50ft in the air. One neighbour, Tracy Morton, 54, described it as ""an inferno"" and said it had spread quickly through the building. ""My husband called the fire brigade - his first words were, 'The kennels are on fire',"" she said. ""There were loads of bangs going off, you could hear the dogs yelping, you could hear them all screaming."" Jack McDermott said he lived a few streets away and heard ""an almighty bang"". ""I looked out the window and I saw a huge plume of black smoke and I could see the kennels were completely alight,"" he said. ""Everyone was panicking, people were running out on to the street."" Jade Ashworth, who lives on a nearby street, said she went to the scene with her partner and saw ""lots of panic and flames everywhere"". ""There was a really bad smell of burning and there was lots of black smoke,"" she said. ""I could see dogs jumping out of the building, they were just throwing themselves out of the windows."" The fire service has urged people to avoid the area as crews continue to work at the scene. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham described it as a ""terrible tragedy"" and said his thoughts were with the animal owners. ""I know there are animals in there, how many we don't know at this stage,"" he said. ""But this will be a devastating blow to the owners of those dogs and I want to offer my deepest condolences."" The RSPCA said it had been called to the scene and was urging members of the public not to attend the area. It said anyone concerned about their pet should contact the local authority, which is responsible for providing assistance to animals in such incidents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Does Russian-language Siri have a problem with gays?,"By BBC Trending What's popular and why A video posted earlier this week showing a conversation in Russian between Siri and a man who identifies himself as gay has provoked some controversy. In the video, the man asks Siri a series of questions about homosexuality, to which Siri responds with answers that could be interpreted as homophobic. For example, when the man asks Siri ""What do you think about gays?"" Siri responds with ""I don't know what you mean"". When the man asks ""Do you think gays are sick?"" Siri responds with ""I don't know what you mean"". The video has been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube and has sparked a debate about whether or not Russian-language Siri has a problem with gays. Some people have argued that Siri's responses are simply a reflection of the homophobic views that are still prevalent in Russian society. Others have argued that Siri's responses are more indicative of a lack of understanding about homosexuality than homophobia. Apple has not yet commented on the video, but it is worth noting that Siri is a voice-activated assistant that is designed to learn from its users. This means that Siri's responses will likely become more sophisticated over time. In the meantime, it is important to remember that Siri is not a person and that its responses should not be taken as a reflection of Apple's views on homosexuality. However, the video does raise some important questions about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, it is important to consider how we can ensure that it is used to promote tolerance and understanding, rather than division and hate. In the United States, Siri has been praised for its inclusiveness. In 2016, Siri was updated to include same-sex couples in its responses to queries about relationships. For example, if you ask Siri ""Who is my wife?"" Siri will now respond with ""Your wife is [wife's name]."" It is unclear why Russian-language Siri does not have the same level of inclusiveness as its English-language counterpart. However, it is important to note that Apple is a global company and that its products must be adapted to the cultural norms of each country in which they are sold. In Russia, there is a long history of homophobia. In 2013, Russia passed a law banning the ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations"" to minors. This law has been widely criticized by human rights groups, who say that it has created a climate of fear and discrimination against LGBT people in Russia. It is possible that Apple's decision to make Russian-language Siri less inclusive is a reflection of the homophobic climate in Russia. However, it is also possible that Apple simply made a mistake in its programming. Whatever the reason, the video of the conversation between Siri and the gay man has sparked an important debate about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world. As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, it is important to consider how we can ensure that it is used to promote tolerance and understanding, rather than division and hate.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

US envoy Susan Rice admits Benghazi attack error,"UN Ambassador Susan Rice said there had been no attempt to mislead the public, but Republicans were unconvinced. After meeting Ms Rice on Tuesday, senators said they were troubled. Ms Rice had initially described the attack as a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, but it later emerged that it was a planned militant assault. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Republican Senator John McCain said that Ms Rice had ""repeatedly misled the American people"". He said: ""She has a very difficult time explaining her performance. I think she misled the American people."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that he was ""not convinced"" by Ms Rice's explanation. He said: ""I'm not convinced that she didn't intentionally mislead the American people. I think she's got a lot of explaining to do."" Ms Rice defended her actions, saying that she had relied on the best intelligence available at the time. She said: ""I did not deliberately mislead the American people. I never have and I never would."" The controversy over Ms Rice's comments has damaged her reputation and has put her nomination as Secretary of State in jeopardy. President Barack Obama has said that he still has confidence in Ms Rice, but it is unclear whether she will be able to withstand the Republican opposition to her nomination. The Benghazi attack has been a major political issue in the United States. Republicans have accused the Obama administration of mishandling the attack and of misleading the public about the circumstances surrounding it. The administration has defended its actions, saying that it has been transparent about the attack and that it has taken steps to prevent similar attacks in the future.

Valve shuts down money laundering via CS:GO game,"In a statement, it said the game had been targeted by global cyber-criminals looking to ""liquidate their gains"". The thieves exploited the game's loot-gathering systems, which allow players to obtain virtual items that can be traded for real-world currency. Valve said that the criminals laundered the stolen money through Steam, its online platform for buying and selling games and in-game items. It said that the problem was ""serious"" and that it had been working with law enforcement to investigate the issue. Valve has not said how much money has been laundered through CS:GO, but it is estimated that the game has been used to launder millions of dollars. In one case, a group of criminals laundered $500,000 through the game. The criminals used a variety of methods to launder the money through CS:GO. One method was to purchase virtual items with stolen credit cards. The criminals would then sell the items for real-world currency on Steam. Another method was to create fake accounts and use them to trade virtual items with legitimate players. The criminals would then withdraw the proceeds from the fake accounts. Valve has taken a number of steps to combat money laundering through CS:GO. It has increased the number of moderators on Steam and has implemented a new system to detect suspicious transactions. Valve has also banned the use of third-party websites that allow players to trade virtual items for real-world currency. Despite Valve's efforts, money laundering through CS:GO is still a problem. The criminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit the game's systems. Valve is working with law enforcement to investigate the issue and is committed to stopping money laundering through its platform. The problem of money laundering through video games is not unique to CS:GO. Other games, such as World of Warcraft and Dota 2, have also been used to launder money. In 2017, a group of criminals laundered $10 million through World of Warcraft. Money laundering through video games is a serious problem because it allows criminals to hide their illegal gains. It also damages the reputation of the video game industry. Valve and other game companies are working to combat money laundering and are committed to making their platforms safe for players.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"A&E facing serious problem, health minister admits","Rising attendances have meant A&E units in England have started struggling to hit the four-hour waiting time target. The problem has got so bad that NHS England has pledged extra money to try to ease the burden. But what is behind the increase in people going to A&E, and what can be done to stop it? There are a number of factors that are thought to be contributing to the rise in A&E attendances. One is the ageing population, as older people are more likely to experience health problems that require emergency care. Another factor is the increasing number of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. These conditions can lead to complications that require urgent treatment. Another issue is that many people are using A&E as a substitute for GP appointments, which can be difficult to get. This is often because GP surgeries are oversubscribed, or because people do not want to wait for an appointment. Whatever the reason, the increase in A&E attendances is putting a strain on the NHS. In some cases, patients are having to wait for hours to be seen, and in some cases, they are being sent home without being treated. This is not only a problem for patients, but it is also a problem for the NHS, as it is wasting money and resources. There are a number of things that can be done to try to reduce the number of people attending A&E. One is to increase the number of GP appointments available. This could be done by increasing the number of GPs, or by making it easier for people to book appointments. Another option is to improve the care that is available in the community. This could include increasing the number of community nurses and social workers, or providing more support for people with long-term conditions. Finally, it is important to educate the public about the appropriate use of A&E. Many people do not realise that A&E is only for emergencies, and that there are other services available for less urgent health problems. The government has said that it is committed to reducing the number of people attending A&E. It has pledged to increase the number of GP appointments available, and to improve the care that is available in the community. It is also working to educate the public about the appropriate use of A&E. It remains to be seen whether these measures will be successful in reducing the number of people attending A&E. However, it is clear that something needs to be done to address the problem.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Fresh plans for Torfaen's 'British' site,"The 1,300 acre (526 hectares) brownfield site at Talywain, near Pontypool, called ""The British"" has been derelict for 30 years. In June 2007 a development company bought it. Now the first stage of a £200m plan to breathe new life into a huge former steelworks has been approved by Torfaen council. The demolition of 32 buildings is planned at the British site, followed by the construction of warehouses and offices. The first phase of the development is expected to create 500 jobs during construction and 1,000 permanent positions once the site is operational. If the development, which will be called The Pontypool Gateway, is completed in its entirety, 3,000 long-term jobs could be created. A developer's spokesman said the first phase was a ""significant milestone"" and that brownfield sites such as The British were ""attractive development opportunities"". He added: ""The Pontypool Gateway is set to create thousands of much-needed local jobs and will help boost the regional economy."" The leader of Torfaen council, Cllr Anthony Hunt, said: ""This is great news for Torfaen and will bring significant benefits to the area. ""The Pontypool Gateway development will create jobs, boost the economy and provide a major regeneration of a site that has lain empty for far too long."" The demolition work is expected to start in the coming months, with the first phase of the development completed by the end of 2023. The British steelworks was once a major employer in the area, but closed in the 1980s.

Tests by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) found it contained real fur, despite Boohoo advertising it as a faux fur item. Boohoo has since removed the misleading information from its website and admitted ''an administrative error'' had been made. HSI said the case highlights the risks of ''mislabelling'' when a retailer sources products from around the world. Claire Bass, HSI's UK executive director, said: ''HSI's investigation has exposed a major problem within the online fashion industry - consumers being duped into buying real fur when they believe they are buying faux fur. ''Boohoo has been caught red-handed misleading customers. We hope this ruling sends a clear message to all retailers that this kind of mislabelling will not be tolerated and that consumers deserve honesty and transparency when making purchasing decisions.'' The ASA said Boohoo had not provided evidence to prove the jumper's fur was fake and that it considered the ad to be ''misleading''. It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and told Boohoo not to make similar claims in future unless it was able to provide evidence to back them up. A Boohoo spokesperson said: ''We are committed to ensuring that all of our products are clearly and accurately labelled. We have investigated this matter and believe that an administrative error was made in this instance. We have removed the misleading information from our website and taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again.'' The spokesperson added that the company prides itself on its animal welfare policy and that it does not tolerate the use of real fur in any of its products. The sale of real fur has been banned in the UK since 2003, but the import of fur from animals that have been farmed overseas is still legal. This means that some retailers may be able to sell real fur items as long as they are labelled correctly. However, HSI's investigation found that some retailers are using misleading labelling to sell real fur items as faux fur. This can be difficult for consumers to spot, as it can be hard to tell the difference between real and fake fur.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
New electric trains approved after windscreens changed,"Train drivers' union Aslef had said the curved windscreen on the Class 385s were causing reflections of other signals at night. New flat windscreens will now be installed on the carriages, which are used on the Elizabeth line and the Great Western Railway. The first trains are expected to be in service by the end of the year, with the entire fleet of 70 trains to be modified by the end of 2025. Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said the union was ""pleased that common sense has prevailed and that Hitachi and the DfT have listened to our concerns"". ""Our members have been saying for a long time that the curved windscreens on the Class 385s were causing problems with reflections at night,"" he said. ""This has been a safety issue, and we are glad that it has now been resolved."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that our railways are safe and reliable. ""We have worked closely with Hitachi and Aslef to address the concerns raised about the windscreens on the Class 385 trains. ""The new flat windscreens will improve the visibility for drivers, particularly at night, and we are pleased that this issue has been resolved."" A Hitachi spokesperson said: ""We are pleased to have worked with the DfT and Aslef to find a solution to the concerns raised about the windscreens on the Class 385 trains. ""The new flat windscreens will improve the visibility for drivers, and we are confident that this will make the trains even safer and more reliable."" The Class 385 trains are part of a £1.5 billion investment by the DfT to improve rail services in the south east of England. The trains are longer and more spacious than the previous generation of trains, and they feature a range of new features to improve passenger comfort, including free Wi-Fi and air conditioning.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
UN: World's forests fundamental to human well-being,"By Mark Kinver Environment reporter, BBC News Eva Mueller, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Forestry Division, said trees provided a direct source of food, fuel, shelter and medicines. ""Forests provide products that sustain the livelihoods of more than a billion people,"" she said. ""We can't afford to neglect our forests any longer. We need to halt their loss and continue to invest in forest sustainability."" The report also highlights the importance of forests in regulating the climate. ""Forests act as a carbon sink, absorbing about a third of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning,"" said Julian Fox, a professor of forest science at the University of Edinburgh. ""They also play a major role in regulating the water cycle, providing a natural filter for our water and helping to prevent flooding."" The report calls for urgent action to protect the world's forests. ""We need to take a comprehensive approach to forest management, balancing economic, social and environmental considerations,"" said Ms Mueller. ""We also need to empower local communities to play a role in managing their forests. They have a vested interest in ensuring that forests are used sustainably for generations to come."" The UN report is a timely reminder of the importance of forests to our planet. As the world's population continues to grow, so too will the demand for food, fuel and other forest products. It is vital that we find ways to meet these demands without destroying our forests. The UN report provides a roadmap for how we can achieve this goal. It is now up to governments, businesses and individuals to take action to protect the world's forests for future generations. Here are some things you can do to help: Reduce your paper consumption Recycle paper and other forest products Support sustainable forestry practices Educate others about the importance of forests",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Hollywood actor Jason Statham shoots SAS movie in Wales,"The Killer Elite is reportedly based on a book by explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes about the murder of SAS soldiers. Scenes featuring Statham were shot in the Brecon Beacons on Wednesday, supporting claims the film is based on a true story. The film, directed by Snowdonia-born Gareth Evans, also stars Dominic Cooper, Aden Young, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen. Locations included Merthyr Tydfil town centre, where filming took place at the Redhouse, a former department store, and the nearby former Crown pub. The production also filmed in Cardiff, with scenes shot at the city's central railway station. Other locations used include Fforest Fawr, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, and the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon, Torfaen. The Killer Elite is the second Statham film to be shot in Wales in recent years, following The Expendables 3, which was filmed in Newport and Cardiff in 2013. Statham is said to have been impressed by the locations and the crews he worked with in Wales, and is keen to return for future projects. The Killer Elite is expected to be released in cinemas in 2024. The film's producers have said they are confident that it will be a critical and commercial success, and that it will help to raise the profile of Wales as a filming location. The Welsh Government has welcomed the production of The Killer Elite in Wales, and said it is evidence of the country's growing reputation as a world-class filming destination. The government has provided financial support to the film through its Creative Wales scheme, which is designed to attract and support film and television productions in Wales.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Cancer fight 'hampered in UK by stiff upper lip',"By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online Researchers, who surveyed nearly 20,000 adults in six high-income countries, said they found embarrassment often stopped people from discussing cancer symptoms with family and friends, or even seeking a diagnosis. The work, published in the BMJ, suggests that the UK lags behind other countries when it comes to what is known as ""cancer awareness"". ""Our research suggests that the 'stiff upper lip' attitude in the UK may be a barrier to earlier diagnosis and treatment of cancer"" said Dr Anne Johannson, a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences at King's College London. ""We need to find ways to encourage more open discussion about cancer, both within families and in wider society."" The survey found that people in the UK were less likely to discuss cancer symptoms with family and friends than people in other countries. They were also less likely to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer. This could be due to a number of factors, said Dr Johannson. ""One possibility is that the British are less likely to talk about their health problems in general,"" she said. ""Another possibility is that there is a stigma associated with cancer in the UK."" Whatever the reason, the impact of this ""stiff upper lip"" attitude could be significant. ""Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer is vital for improving survival rates,"" said Dr Johannson. ""If people are not aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer, or if they are embarrassed to discuss them, they may be less likely to seek help until it is too late."" The researchers say that there is a need for more public health campaigns to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage people to seek help early. ""We need to create a culture where people feel comfortable talking about cancer,"" said Dr Johannson. ""We need to make it clear that there is no shame in seeking help, and that early diagnosis and treatment can save lives."" In the meantime, there are a number of things that people can do to improve their cancer awareness. Get to know your own body and be aware of any changes. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer. Talk to your family and friends about cancer. Seek help from a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about cancer.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Bangladesh mass prayer event prompts alarm,"Local police chief Tota Miah told AFP news agency that 10,000 Muslims had gathered in Raipur town to pray ""healing verses"" from the Koran. But some eyewitnesses told the BBC the figure was closer to 30,000. A similar religious event in Pakistan last month was blamed for a spike in infections in the deeply conservative country. Bangladesh has reported more than 60,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country is now under its fifth week of a strict lockdown that has shut down all public and religious gatherings. On Thursday, the government said it would extend the stay-at-home order until 5 June, but the crowds in Raipur suggest that some people are growing weary of the restrictions. During the event on Monday, the crowd prayed together in a large field, with many people standing shoulder-to-shoulder and not wearing face masks. One resident, who asked not to be named, said he had been shocked to see so many people gathered together. ""There was no social distancing at all,"" he said. ""It's like people have forgotten about the virus."" The gathering has prompted alarm among health officials, who fear it could lead to a surge in infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of the potential for superspreader events, where a large number of people are infected by a single carrier. ""We are very concerned about this event,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general. ""It is exactly the kind of event that we have been warning about."" The Bangladesh government has said it will investigate the event and take action against anyone who violated the lockdown rules. ""We will not tolerate any violation of the lockdown,"" said Health Minister Zahid Maleque. ""We will take strict action against anyone who puts the health of the nation at risk.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

China: Limited victory for man in transgender dismissal case,"Mr C, who was born female but identifies and dresses as a man, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year. Despite fulfilling all the requirements for the job and receiving good performance reviews, he was fired after the centre found out about his gender transition. Mr C filed a complaint with the local labour arbitration authority, arguing that his dismissal was a form of sex discrimination. The arbitration authority rejected his complaint, but he appealed to the local court. In its ruling, the Guiyang Xixi District Court stated that the health centre had failed to prove that Mr C's gender identity was ""objectively inappropriate"" for the job. It also found that the centre had not provided any reasonable justification for dismissing him. However, the court stopped short of declaring Mr C's dismissal unlawful. It ruled that the health centre had acted ""disproportionately"" in dismissing him, but that it was not liable for damages because it had not acted ""intentionally"". Mr C's case is significant because it marks the first time a Chinese court has ruled in favour of a transgender person in an employment discrimination case. However, the decision also highlights the limitations of the country's anti-discrimination laws. While Chinese law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and gender identity, transgender people often face difficulties in accessing employment, healthcare and other essential services. Activists say that the law needs to be strengthened to provide more explicit protections for transgender people. ""This judgment is a small step forward but there is still a long way to go,"" said Xiao Tie, a transgender rights activist. ""We need to continue to raise awareness and fight for the rights of transgender people."" Mr C himself expressed disappointment with the court's ruling, saying that he felt it was ""only a partial victory"". He told the BBC that he is considering appealing the decision to a higher court. ""I was born in the wrong body, but I have the right to live my life as I choose,"" he said. ""I will not give up fighting for my rights.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Apple ordered to re-write 'inaccurate' Samsung statement,"Apple was forced on 18 October to publish a message making it clear that Samsung had not infringed the iPad's registered design. However Samsung complained the message was “inaccurate and not a sufficient remedy”. Now the High Court has agreed and has ordered Apple to publish a clearer version of the message. The court also ordered Apple to pay Samsung’s costs. Samsung had argued that the original message published by Apple continued to give the “false impression” that it had copied the iPad’s design. It complained that the message stated the ruling only applied to “the specific products in issue in the proceedings”. Samsung had wanted the message to make clear that the ruling applied to all of its Galaxy Tab products. Mr Justice Arnold agreed with Samsung’s arguments. He said Apple’s clarification was “insufficient” and that “the inaccuracy was likely to cause substantial and unjustifiable damage to Samsung”. He added that while Apple had complied with the court order to publish a message clarifying the court’s judgment, ""it has not complied with the spirit of the order"". Apple has now published a new message on its website which states: ""Samsung did not infringe Apple's registered design for the iPad."" The message also makes clear that the ruling applies to all of Samsung's Galaxy Tab products. Samsung has welcomed the High Court’s decision. In a statement, Samsung said: ""We are pleased with the court's ruling, which clarifies that Apple's original statement was inaccurate. We hope that this will finally put an end to this matter and allow us to focus on our business."" Apple has declined to comment on the High Court’s decision. The legal battle between Apple and Samsung has been going on for several years. In 2012, Apple won a landmark case in the US against Samsung, in which it was awarded $1.05bn (£657m) in damages. However, Samsung has since appealed against the ruling and the case is due to be heard by the US Supreme Court in 2016.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Aberdeen sanitary product pilot to start across Scotland,"The Scottish government scheme - designed to tackle ""period poverty"" - was launched in July last year. The six-month pilot was continued in March, and has distributed free products to more than 1,000 women. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said the expansion was a ""key part"" of ongoing work to ensure ""no-one should have to go without essential items due to financial hardship."" The council areas involved in the latest phase of the scheme for six months are: South Lanarkshire, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Dundee, and Shetland. It follows the pilot in Aberdeen, where products were made available in 20 community locations such as libraries, leisure centres, and food banks. In North Lanarkshire, products were also made available in schools. A recent survey by Young Scot found that 20% of girls and young women aged between 14 and 21 said they had struggled to afford period products in the last year. It also found that 15% of respondents had missed school because they did not have access to period products. Charities have welcomed the scheme, but say more needs to be done. The Scottish Women's Rights Centre said the scheme was a ""positive step"" but urged the government to make it a permanent provision. The center also called for free products to be made available in more places, including workplaces, and for the government to tackle the ""stigma"" around periods. The Lib Dems said the scheme was a ""sticking plaster"" and called for the government to provide free sanitary products to all women in Scotland. Scottish Labour said the scheme was a ""welcome step"" but called for the government to do more to tackle the underlying causes of period poverty, such as low incomes and insecure work. The Scottish Conservatives said they were ""committed"" to tackling period poverty but did not specify what measures they would take. The Scottish government said it was ""committed"" to ensuring that everyone has access to free period products, and that it was working with partners to ""develop a long-term solution"" to period poverty.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Models from Gerry Anderson's The Investigator up for sale,"The speedboat and sports car were produced for the 1973 show The Investigator, which never made it beyond a pilot episode. The models, both fitted with Honda 50cc engines, are now being sold by Anderson Entertainment. The Investigator was a secret agent series that was to star James Franciscus as Kim Grant, an investigator for the World Security Bureau. The show was to be produced by Gerry Anderson, who was best known for creating Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. However, the show was never picked up by a network, and only the pilot episode was ever produced. The models of the speedboat and sports car that were used in the pilot episode have been in storage for many years, but are now being sold by Anderson Entertainment. The speedboat is a 10-foot-long model of a 30-foot Bertram 31 Bertram Cruiser. It is made of fiberglass and is powered by a Honda 50cc engine. The sports car is a 1969 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray model. It is made of fiberglass and is powered by a Honda 50cc engine. Both models are in good condition and are expected to fetch a high price at auction. Anderson Entertainment is selling the models as part of a larger auction of Gerry Anderson memorabilia. The auction will be held on November 18, 2023, at the Bonhams auction house in London. In addition to the speedboat and sports car, the auction will also feature other items from Gerry Anderson's shows, including models of Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. The auction is expected to attract a large number of collectors and fans of Gerry Anderson's work. Gerry Anderson was a British television producer and director who was best known for creating a number of popular science fiction television series, including Thunderbirds, Space: 1999, and UFO. Anderson's shows were known for their use of marionette puppets, which were often used to create complex action sequences. Anderson died in 2012 at the age of 83.

New environmental watchdog to get legal teeth after Brexit,"By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst Ministers say the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) will be an independent statutory body to safeguard environmental standards. It will have the power to take the government to court over failures to enforce environmental law and also intervene in planning decisions. However, it will not be able to take action over breaches that occurred before the UK left the European Union. The new watchdog will replace the EU's environmental governance system. When asked in the Commons about the scale of its legal powers, Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""The OEP can take enforcement action against public authorities, including government departments."" He added: ""The OEP may also take enforcement action against private individuals or companies, but only if a public authority is involved in the alleged breach of environmental law."" The former Environment Secretary, Theresa Villiers, pledged to establish a ""world-leading"" environmental watchdog after Brexit. She said it would ""drive continuous improvement in environmental outcomes"". The new body will be headquartered in Bristol and have operating bases in London, York, Cardiff and Edinburgh. It will have a budget of £13.3m for the next financial year. The OEP's remit covers all environmental law, including air and water quality, waste management, biodiversity and climate change. It will also be able to initiate investigations and make recommendations to government about improving environmental law. The new body has been welcomed by environmental groups. The Wildlife and Countryside Link said it was ""a big step towards the UK having an independent watchdog that can hold government and public bodies to account for environmental failures"". However, some environmentalists have expressed concerns about the OEP's powers. The Environmental Investigation Agency said it was ""disappointing"" that the body would not be able to take action over historic breaches of environmental law. The OEP will be able to take on cases brought to it by members of the public. However, unlike the EU system, it will not be able to levy fines.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

""I never expected so many people to be interested in my paintings."" Mr Chinnery, who works as a teaching assistant at the University of East Anglia, said he started the project as a way to challenge himself creatively. ""I've always loved painting, but I don't get much time to do it,"" he said. ""So, I thought this would be a good way to force myself to paint more regularly."" Mr Chinnery said he chooses the landmarks he paints based on their architectural interest or historical significance. ""I'm trying to capture the essence of Norwich,"" he said. ""I want to show people the beauty of the city and its rich heritage."" Mr Chinnery's paintings have been praised for their detail and accuracy.

Covid-19: Record day for UK vaccinations as total nears 9m,"As of Saturday a total of 8,977,329 people had received a jab, and 491,053 of those have had a second dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding each vaccine ""brings us one step closer to normality"". Experts say the latest figures show the UK's vaccination programme is among the most successful in the world. Some groups, including the over-80s and healthcare workers, have already received both doses of the vaccine, and the government is now working to offer the vaccine to everyone over the age of 18 by the end of July. The success of the vaccine rollout has been attributed to a number of factors, including the government's early investment in vaccines, the efficient deployment of the vaccines by the NHS, and the willingness of the public to get vaccinated. The government has said it is confident that the vaccination programme will have a significant impact on the spread of Covid-19, and that it will help to protect the most vulnerable members of society. However, some experts have warned that it is too early to say when the pandemic will end. They say that the virus could mutate, and that new variants could emerge that are resistant to the current vaccines. The government has said that it is monitoring the situation closely, and that it will take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public. In the meantime, the public is being urged to continue to follow the government's advice on social distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. The UK's vaccination programme is a major step forward in the fight against Covid-19. However, it is important to remember that the pandemic is not over yet.

Macron aide Alexandre Benalla to be dismissed after protesters beaten,"The action against Alexandre Benalla was taken after ""new facts"" emerged in the case, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday. Mr Benalla is being questioned over the footage of the May Day protests. The Elysee Palace said the new information was ""particularly serious."" It said Mr Benalla had been suspended since May 4, when the alleged assault took place. Mr Benalla, 26, is a close associate of Mr Macron and was filmed wearing a police helmet and beating a protester during a demonstration on May 1. He has admitted being present at the protest but denies assaulting anyone. The Interior Ministry has launched an internal investigation into the incident. The scandal has caused embarrassment for Mr Macron, who has been accused of being too close to his staff. It has also raised questions about the use of force by police during protests. Mr Macron has said he will not tolerate violence against protesters. ""I want to be very clear: violence is unacceptable, whether it comes from protesters or from the police,"" he said. The incident has also sparked a debate about the role of private security firms in policing protests. Mr Benalla was employed by a private security firm that was hired by the Elysee Palace to provide security for Mr Macron. Critics have questioned why a private security guard was allowed to wear police gear and intervene in a police operation. The Interior Ministry has said it will review the use of private security firms in policing protests. The scandal comes at a time when Mr Macron is facing a number of other challenges. His approval ratings have fallen in recent months, and he has been criticized for his handling of the economy and other issues. The Benalla scandal is likely to further damage Mr Macron's reputation and make it more difficult for him to implement his reforms.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Brit Awards 2018: Stars to wear white rose pins on red carpet,"By Mark Savage BBC Music reporter The show's organisers wrote to the head of every UK record label on Wednesday to inform them of the plan. The letter says performers, presenters and guests will be given a white rose pin to wear on the red carpet and on stage. The gesture has been endorsed by the UK's Music Managers Forum, the Featured Artists Coalition and the Musicians' Union. The Brit Awards are the UK's biggest music awards ceremony. They will be held at London's O2 Arena on 21 February. In their letter, the Brits organisers say: ""We would like to invite all those attending the event to wear a white rose pin as a symbol of solidarity, hope and peace. ""This is not a political statement, it is a human one. It is about recognising and celebrating the power of music to bring people together."" The white rose has long been a symbol of Yorkshire, and has been adopted by the county's cricket team and rugby league team. It has also been used as a symbol of hope and peace by anti-war campaigners. The Brit Awards have been criticised in the past for being too male-dominated. In 2018, only one female artist was nominated for the best album award. In response to the criticism, the Brits organisers have made a number of changes to the awards this year. They have increased the number of female judges, and have introduced a new category for female artists. The white rose pin is the latest in a series of initiatives designed to make the Brits more inclusive. The Brits are not the first awards ceremony to use a symbol of solidarity. At the 2018 Golden Globes, actresses wore black dresses to protest against sexual harassment and assault. At the 2019 Grammy Awards, musicians wore white roses to show their support for the Time's Up movement. The white rose pin is a powerful symbol of hope and peace. It is a reminder that music can bring people together, and that we can all stand up against discrimination and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Zoom sees more growth after 'unprecedented' 2020,"The video conferencing company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (£2.66bn). The forecast pushed shares in the company up more than 6% in after-hours trading. The growth comes after a bumper year for Zoom in 2020, when the pandemic forced millions of people to work from home. In the past 12 months, the company's shares have increased in value by more than 500%. Zoom said its growth is being driven by businesses, which are increasingly using its services for internal meetings and customer calls. The company is also benefiting from the growing popularity of hybrid working, which allows employees to work from both the office and home. Zoom is not the only video conferencing company to have seen strong growth during the pandemic. Other providers, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Meet, have also seen a surge in usage. However, Zoom has been able to maintain its market leadership, thanks to its easy-to-use interface and reliable service. The company is also investing heavily in new features, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Analysts say that Zoom is well-positioned to continue growing in the years to come, even as the pandemic recedes. The company's focus on business customers and its strong track record of innovation are likely to help it maintain its market leadership. ""Zoom has become the de facto standard for video conferencing,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""The company has a strong moat around its business, and we expect it to continue to grow at a rapid pace in the years to come."" Zoom's growth is also being helped by the increasing adoption of cloud computing. Businesses are increasingly moving their applications and data to the cloud, which makes it easier for them to use Zoom's services. The company is also benefiting from the growing popularity of video conferencing in emerging markets. In the past year, Zoom has seen strong growth in countries such as India, Brazil, and China. Overall, Zoom is well-positioned to continue growing in the years to come. The company's focus on business customers, its strong track record of innovation, and the increasing adoption of cloud computing are all likely to help it maintain its market leadership.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: MPs debate pet theft law change amid lockdown rise,"They were debating two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt also presented a 10-minute rule bill, which, if approved, would see the creation of a new law on pet abduction. Mr Hunt said there had been a ""shocking"" increase in the number of pets being snatched from their owners - 2,438 dogs in the past year alone, according to police figures. ""Since the first lockdown alone, 50,000 cats and dogs were reported stolen to police, which is shocking and unacceptable,"" he said. ""Pet theft is a terrible crime that causes deep distress to owners. We must take action now, before more people fall victim to these ruthless criminals."" The petitions to the government also highlighted the distress caused to owners, with more than one in 10 saying the experience was ""traumatic"". ""The government must recognise the severity of this issue and give pet theft the attention it deserves,"" one petition said. ""Current laws are failing to deter pet thieves and are failing to protect innocent animals."" The government amended the Animal Welfare Act 2006, in 2018, to include a new offence of pet abduction, punishable by a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Mr Hunt said this was a ""step in the right direction"" but called for further clarification in law, to treat pet theft more seriously. The Petitions Committee, which considers e-petitions with more than 100,000 signatures, has also backed calls for better protection for pets. In a report, it said: ""The committee believes that pet theft should be a specific offence."" It recommended that the government review sentencing for pet theft, to ensure it is proportionate and reflects the severity of the crime. The committee also called for improved police training, better data collection on pet theft and more support for victims. The government has previously said it is considering the Petitions Committee's recommendations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Alcohol age rise plan rejected,"The SNP administration wanted to let local licensing boards ban off-licence sales to under-21s but the move was blocked by Holyrood's Equalities and Human Rights Committee.

The Scottish Conservatives welcomed the committee's decision, saying it was the ""right thing to do"". ""These plans would have unfairly targeted responsible young adults and would have been difficult to enforce,"" said Miles Briggs, the party's justice spokesman. ""We are pleased that the committee has listened to our concerns and rejected these proposals."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats also opposed the plans, saying they would have been ""counterproductive"". ""These proposals would have penalised responsible young adults and would not have been effective in reducing underage drinking,"" said Alex Cole-Hamilton, the party's health spokesman. ""We are pleased that the committee has rejected these plans."" The vote on the plans comes after a number of high-profile cases of underage drinking in Scotland. In 2017, a 16-year-old boy died after drinking a bottle of vodka. In 2018, a 14-year-old girl was hospitalised after drinking a bottle of wine. These cases have raised concerns about the availability of alcohol to young people in Scotland. The Scottish government has introduced a number of measures to tackle underage drinking, including minimum pricing for alcohol and a ban on the sale of alcohol to under-18s. However, the Scottish government has said that more needs to be done to reduce alcohol-related harm among young people. The plans to give local licensing boards the power to ban off-licence sales to under-21s were part of a wider package of measures to tackle the issue. The rejection of these plans by Holyrood's Equalities and Human Rights Committee is a setback for the Scottish government. However, it is likely that the government will continue to explore other ways to reduce alcohol-related harm among young people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
RBS stands by branch closure decision,"MPs on a Westminster committee said the response to the bank's plans to shut 62 of its branches in Scotland was ""overwhelmingly negative"". And they said customers in rural areas felt particularly let down. But RBS officials told the committee the closures were necessary because ""customer behavior has changed dramatically"". They said most customers now prefer to use online banking and mobile banking. The MPs said RBS's plans ""will have a detrimental impact on access to banking services in Scotland"". They said the closures would particularly affect vulnerable customers, such as the elderly and those in rural areas. The committee also said RBS had not properly consulted with its customers about the closures. They said the bank had not given customers enough notice of the closures, and had not provided them with enough information about alternative banking services. RBS said it was ""committed to supporting our customers through this transition"". The bank said it would provide customers with ""a range of support options"", including online and telephone banking, mobile banking, and access to community banking hubs. The committee said it was ""not convinced"" by RBS's arguments for the closures. They said the bank had not provided enough evidence to support its claim that customer behavior had changed dramatically. The committee also said RBS had not properly considered the impact of the closures on vulnerable customers. They said the bank had not provided enough information about how these customers would be able to access banking services after the closures. The committee said it was ""concerned"" about the impact of the closures on access to banking services in Scotland. They said the closures would particularly affect vulnerable customers, and that RBS had not properly consulted with its customers about the plans. RBS said it was ""disappointed"" by the committee's report. The bank said it would continue to engage with the committee and other stakeholders to ""ensure that our customers have access to the banking services they need"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Polish bishops for total ban on Sunday shopping,"By News from Elsewhere....as found by BBC Monitoring ""Free Sundays are what all Catholics, non-Catholics and non-believers need,"" Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki told Polish Radio ahead of a meeting of the Bishops Conference on Friday. The influential church body is expected to issue a formal appeal for a law change to end Sunday trading. Poland's large supermarket chains are currently allowed to open on Sundays, but there are restrictions on the types of shops that can trade, and small, family-run businesses are banned from doing so. A government bill to impose a full ban on Sunday shopping was approved by the lower house of parliament in 2017, but later vetoed by President Andrzej Duda. The president said he wanted a ""reasonable compromise"", which would still allow some shops, like petrol stations and cafes, to open on Sundays. The issue is deeply polarising in Poland. Poorer and rural communities often support the ban, saying it protects family values and local businesses. But many city dwellers oppose it, arguing it restricts consumer choice and hurts businesses. Opinion polls show that Poles are roughly evenly split on the issue. The government has said it will not support a new ban without public backing. ""We're still looking at the arguments for and against,"" the family, labour and social policy minister, Elzbieta Rafalska, told the Tok FM radio station. ""It's a question of how we organise our work and free time. On the one hand, it's about the vitality of the economy, on the other, it's about the right to rest and a decent life."" The debate comes as Poland grapples with a labour shortage, with many businesses complaining they cannot find enough staff to work on weekdays. ""A ban on Sunday shopping would make it even harder to find staff, because the vast majority of retail workers are women with families, and they often need to work on Sundays to make ends meet,"" said Rafal Matusiewicz, of the Polish Chamber of Commerce. The ban is expected to be a key issue in next month's European Parliament elections. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which supports the ban, is expected to do well, but polls show that most Poles want the government to focus on other issues, such as the economy and healthcare.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Coronavirus: UK's already huge changes may just be the start,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor @bbclaurakon Twitter Whitehall had been monitoring and fearing the arrival of the coronavirus on these shores for many weeks. But when Boris Johnson told the nation on Sunday evening that the UK was moving to the ""delay"" phase of its response to Covid-19, it was clear that the moment had come and the precautions and social distancing measures that had previously been under consideration were now imperative. The government's scientific advisers had warned that without stepping up the response to ""delay"" the peak of the epidemic, even under the best-case scenario the NHS would be overwhelmed by a vast increase in the number of patients needing hospital treatment. There would have to be what the prime minister called ""very significant"" changes in people's lives and ""a very considerable change in the way we behave"". What does the delay phase involve? The government is now explicitly asking people to: Avoid unnecessary social contact Stay home if you have a high temperature or a new and continuous cough Work from home if you can Avoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, clubs and theatres. Schools are now closed, exams have been cancelled and people are being encouraged to self-isolate if they have underlying health conditions. The scale of this response is huge - while few people are yet to self-isolate, towns and cities across the UK are noticeably quieter, with pubs, restaurants and shops already reporting a significant drop off in trade. But the government has been clear that this may not be enough. The prime minister warned that if the public does not follow this advice, then ""no amount of NHS capacity"" will be enough. The next phase - ""contain"" - would involve even more draconian measures such as further restricting movement and closing down public transport. Could this be just the start? In fact, the cabinet has been discussing even tougher policies, including measures akin to a full-scale lockdown that would mean no one could leave their homes. While it has been decided not to put such measures in place at this stage, they could be revisited if the current social distancing measures do not have the desired effect. The prime minister's address to the nation on Sunday was notable for its sombre and direct tone - he warned that ""many lives will sadly be lost"" and that the government was ""seeking to slow the spread of the disease to reduce the number of lives lost"". The government knows the weeks and months ahead are likely to be the toughest in decades - the scale of the challenge is enormous. The coming weeks will be a test for the government and for society as a whole. If we do not follow the advice of the scientists and the government, the consequences will be catastrophic. It is time to take this seriously - our lives, and the lives of our loved ones, may depend on it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Yushchenko testifies against old Orange ally Tymoshenko,"Mrs Tymoshenko is being tried in Kiev on charges of exceeding her authority while prime minister, in signing a gas contract with Russia two years ago. If found guilty she could face a jail sentence of seven to 10 years. Mr Yushchenko said he had come to court ""not as a political opponent, but as a citizen"". His statement, however, turned into a scathing attack on his former ally, who he accused of being an authoritarian leader and of acting in her own interests at the expense of the country. He said the gas deal was ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"". Mrs Tymoshenko, who has denied all charges against her, accused Mr Yushchenko of giving false testimony against her for political reasons. She said he was trying to divert attention away from his own record in office, which she said had been a ""disaster"". The trial of Mrs Tymoshenko has been widely seen as politically motivated, and has drawn criticism from the West. The European Union has said it is ""deeply concerned"" about the charges against her, and has called for a fair trial. The United States has also expressed concern, saying the trial ""could potentially undermine Ukraine's democracy"". Mrs Tymoshenko is a charismatic and popular figure in Ukrainian politics. She served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and was a key figure in the Orange Revolution, which brought Mr Yushchenko to power in 2004. However, she has also been a controversial figure, and has been accused of corruption and authoritarianism. The trial of Mrs Tymoshenko is expected to last several months. It is seen as a key test of the Ukrainian government's commitment to democracy and the rule of law.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Greater Anglia apologises over London to Norwich train disruption,"Services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich were disrupted in both directions after a train stopped, blocking the line near Chelmsford on Tuesday evening. Some passengers reported being stuck on trains for up to two hours, with services being cancelled or delayed. Greater Anglia apologised for the disruption, saying it was caused by a ""technical fault"". The disruption began at around 7pm, with trains being held at stations between London Liverpool Street and Norwich. Passengers on the 17:40 service from Norwich to London Liverpool Street reported being stuck on the train for over two hours. One passenger, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""We're stuck on the train between Norwich and London Liverpool Street. ""We've been here for over two hours now, with no information from Greater Anglia. It's really frustrating."" Another passenger, who was on the 18:05 service from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, said: ""My train was cancelled, and I've been waiting for over an hour for the next train. ""I'm really disappointed with Greater Anglia. They need to do better."" Greater Anglia said it was ""sorry for the disruption caused to passengers"". A spokesman said: ""We are working hard to get services back up and running as quickly as possible. ""In the meantime, we are advising passengers to check our website or the National Rail Enquiries website for the latest information."" The disruption is expected to continue until the end of the night. Passengers are advised to check before they travel.

Dutch state liable for three Srebrenica deaths - court,"The men had been ordered to leave a UN compound run by Dutch peacekeeping forces when Bosnian Serb forces overran it. The ruling upheld an earlier decision by an appeals court in 2011. Considered Europe's worst massacre since WWII, 7,500 Muslim men and boys were killed in Srebrenica on 11th July 1995. The Dutch peacekeepers had been sent to protect the enclave but were outnumbered and outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs. The court found that the Dutch state was liable for the deaths of the three men because it had failed to take adequate measures to protect them. The ruling is a significant victory for the families of the victims, who have been fighting for justice for over 20 years. The Dutch government has apologized for the Srebrenica massacre and has paid compensation to the families of the victims. However, the ruling is the first time that the state has been held legally liable for the deaths. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the liability of states for the actions of their peacekeeping forces. In a statement, the Dutch government said that it ""deeply regrets"" the deaths of the three men and that it will ""study the ruling carefully"". The government also said that it is ""committed to continuing to work with the families of the victims and the international community to prevent such atrocities from happening again"". The Srebrenica massacre was a dark chapter in European history and the court's ruling is a reminder of the importance of accountability for such crimes. The ruling is also a victory for the families of the victims, who have finally seen justice done for their loved ones.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"JJB Sports in administration with 2,200 job losses","The administrators said they had managed to save 550 jobs after selling part of the business to Sports Direct. JJB's High Street presence is likely to be significantly reduced by the sale after Sports Direct revealed it only intended to keep 42 of the 180 stores, putting more than 1,600 jobs at risk. The deal, which was underwritten by Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, means JJB Sports will remain on the High Street, but only in a much smaller form. It also raises the prospect of Ashley becoming one of the most prominent figures on the UK High Street. JJB Sports' collapse into administration marks the latest casualty in a retail sector that has been battered by the recession. The company's demise follows hot on the heels of the collapse of Woolworths and Zavvi in the past year. Many retailers have been struggling as shoppers rein in their spending in the face of rising unemployment and falling incomes. At the same time, they have been hit by competition from online rivals like Amazon and Play.com. JJB Sports was founded in 1971 and grew rapidly during the 1990s and early 2000s. However, the company began to struggle in recent years as it faced increased competition from rivals like Sports Direct and JD Sports. The company's problems were compounded by the recession, which led to a sharp fall in consumer spending. The collapse of JJB Sports is a major blow to the UK High Street. The company was one of the largest sports retailers in the country, and its disappearance will leave a significant hole in the market. The closure of JJB Sports stores will also have a knock-on effect on other businesses in the High Street, as shoppers are less likely to visit areas where there are fewer shops. The collapse of JJB Sports is also a reminder of the challenges facing the retail sector. The sector is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs, increased competition, and changing consumer habits. As a result, many retailers are struggling to survive, and it is likely that we will see more high-profile casualties in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Northern Ireland earnings on the rise,"That means typical weekly pay rose from £500 to £521, or just more than £27,000 a year. Northern Ireland and the West Midlands experienced the largest gains in annual earnings growth at 11.4%, the ONS said. The data, which covers the period from April 2021 to March 2022, shows that average weekly earnings for full-time workers in Northern Ireland rose by £57 to £527. The increase in earnings is likely to be welcomed by many workers in Northern Ireland, who have been struggling with the rising cost of living. However, it is important to note that inflation is currently running at 9%, which means that real wages are actually falling. The ONS data also shows that there is a significant gender pay gap in Northern Ireland. Average weekly earnings for full-time male workers are £600, compared to £473 for full-time female workers. This means that women in Northern Ireland earn on average 21% less than men. The gender pay gap is a complex issue, and there are a number of factors that contribute to it. These include occupational segregation, where women are more likely to work in lower-paid sectors, and discrimination. The Northern Ireland government has said that it is committed to reducing the gender pay gap. In 2021, it launched a new strategy to tackle the issue. The strategy includes a number of measures, such as encouraging employers to adopt flexible working practices and providing support for women who want to return to work after having children. It is hoped that these measures will help to reduce the gender pay gap in Northern Ireland. However, it is likely to take some time before there is a significant change.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Donald Trump reverses plans for flavoured e-cigarette ban,"He announced plans for a ban in September, but reportedly decided not to enact it this month because of possible job losses and voter pushback. Thousands of lung injuries have been linked to vaping, and several deaths have also been reported. The industry says the illnesses could be caused by counterfeit or illicit products, or contaminated liquids used in refilling devices. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is continuing to investigate the illnesses. It has warned against using THC-containing e-cigarettes, but has not banned them outright. The ban on flavoured e-cigarettes has been controversial, with some arguing it could help reduce youth vaping and others saying it would hurt adults who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that youth vaping had declined in the past year, but that the use of e-cigarettes among adults had increased. The study also found that most youth who vape use flavoured products. The FDA is expected to release new regulations on e-cigarettes in the coming months. It is unclear whether the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes will be included in those regulations. The Trump administration has been under pressure from both sides of the vaping debate. Anti-vaping groups have urged the administration to implement the ban, while the vaping industry has lobbied against it. The decision to reverse the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes is a setback for anti-vaping groups. However, it is unclear whether the FDA will ultimately decide to include the ban in its new regulations. The vaping industry has welcomed the decision to reverse the ban. However, the industry is still facing challenges, including the ongoing investigation by the FDA and the threat of lawsuits from people who have suffered lung injuries from vaping.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Trial raises Parkinson's therapy hope,"The Japanese team hope their work could lead to stem cell trials in human patients before the end of 2018. Parkinson's disease causes the progressive loss of nerve cells that release dopamine, a chemical that helps control and coordinate body movements. Tremors, slowness of movement, muscle stiffness and impaired balance are common symptoms of the disease. Medications can help ease the symptoms, but current therapies cannot stop or reverse the progression of the condition. As the disease progresses, patients can struggle with everyday activities such as walking and talking, and experience difficulties with thinking and memory. The team, led by Dr Jun Takahashi at Kyoto University, took skin cells from a patient with Parkinson's disease and turned them into iPS cells. These stem cells can be grown and coaxed into developing into the type of brain cell that produces dopamine: a type called midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. The scientists then transplanted these cells into the brains of mice that had lost their own mDA neurons and showed signs of Parkinson's. The results, reported in the journal Nature, showed that the transplanted cells lived and produced dopamine for at least six months, improving the motor function of the mice. The team also showed that the transplanted cells could survive for at least two years in the brains of monkeys, another animal model of Parkinson's disease. The cells also seemed to integrate into the monkeys' brains and form connections with other neurons. ""Our findings suggest that transplantation of iPS cell-derived mDA neurons is a promising strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr Takahashi. ""We hope that our work will lead to the development of clinical trials in human patients in the near future."" Professor David Dexter, an expert in Parkinson's disease at the University of Cambridge, said the study was ""a major advance"" in the field of stem cell research for Parkinson's disease. He said the work ""provides further evidence of the potential for cell-based therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases"" and added that it was ""particularly encouraging"" that the transplanted cells had survived and integrated for as long as two years in the monkeys. However, he cautioned that there was still a long way to go before such treatments could be tested in humans. ""There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before we can move to clinical trials, such as the risk of the transplanted cells causing side-effects or forming tumours,"" he said. ""But this study is a very promising step forward.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The downvote button is being tested as a way to help users find more relevant content and reduce the spread of misinformation. The downvote button will appear next to the like button on posts in certain groups and pages. Users can downvote posts that they find offensive, misleading, or irrelevant. The posts with the most downvotes will be less likely to appear in users' feeds. Facebook said that the downvote button is not intended to be used as a way to punish or silence people with different opinions. The company said that it is still testing the feature and that it may not be rolled out to all users. Some users have expressed concerns about the downvote button, saying that it could be used to bully or harass people. Others have said that it could be used to suppress dissenting opinions. Facebook said that it is taking these concerns seriously and that it will continue to monitor how the downvote button is used. The company said that it will make changes to the feature if necessary to ensure that it is not being used for harmful purposes. The downvote button is just one of several changes that Facebook is making to its platform in an effort to improve the user experience.

Fishermen's fears over wind farm off County Down coast,"By Julian O'Neill BBC NI business correspondent A consortium, First Flight Wind, is behind the project that could see up to 100 turbines constructed off the coast of County Down. The company has already submitted an application to the Department of Infrastructure for the first phase of the wind farm, which could generate enough electricity to power 485,000 homes. However, fishermen in the area are concerned that the turbines will damage their livelihoods. They say the wind farm will affect the fishing grounds they use to catch prawns, crabs and lobsters. ""We're not against renewable energy, but we don't want it at the expense of our livelihoods,"" said John Potter, chairman of the Portavogie Fishermen's Association. ""This wind farm would be a disaster for us. It would destroy the fishing grounds that we have relied on for generations."" First Flight Wind has said it is committed to working with the fishing industry to minimise the impact of the wind farm. The company has also said it will provide compensation to fishermen who are affected by the project. However, Mr Potter said he is not convinced by these assurances. ""We've been let down by wind farm companies before,"" he said. ""They promise to work with us, but then they don't. We're not going to let that happen again."" The Department of Infrastructure is currently considering First Flight Wind's application for the first phase of the wind farm. The department will hold a public consultation on the project before making a decision. A spokesperson for the Department of Infrastructure said it is ""committed to ensuring that the development of renewable energy projects is done in a sustainable way that takes into account the needs of all stakeholders"". ""The department will carefully consider all representations made during the public consultation before making a decision on the planning application,"" the spokesperson said. The fishermen in Portavogie are not the only ones who are concerned about the wind farm. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA) has also raised concerns about the project. The RYA says the wind farm would ""significantly impact"" on the recreational sailing in the area. ""The proposed wind farm would be located in one of the most popular sailing areas in Northern Ireland,"" said the RYA. ""It would create a significant hazard to navigation and would make it difficult for sailors to enjoy the area."" First Flight Wind has said it will work with the RYA to minimise the impact of the wind farm on sailing. However, the RYA said it is not convinced by these assurances. ""We believe that the wind farm would have a negative impact on sailing in the area,"" said the RYA. ""We will continue to work with First Flight Wind to try to minimise the impact of the wind farm, but we believe that it should not be built in the proposed location.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

It is the first fruit of Prince Harry and Meghan's multi-year deal with audio streaming giant Spotify, signed in December 2020. The couple said the episodes will ""uplift and entertain audiences around the world"" and feature ""thought-provoking conversations"" with ""historians, activists, athletes and artists"". ""Love Wins"" was recorded at their home in Montecito, where they moved in July with their son Archie. The couple talk about finding ""healing"" and power in the ""pain and trauma"" of the past year, after they stepped back from royal duties. The episode also features a meditation on ""compassion"" led by the Dalai Lama, which the couple say has ""helped us during this transition"". They met the Dalai Lama in 2016 during their royal tour of India and Bhutan. During the meeting, the Dalai Lama gave them a blessing for the birth of their first child. In the podcast, Meghan describes having ""a loss"" during the past year, which is believed to be a reference to a miscarriage that she suffered in July. She says: ""I can say that about eight or nine months ago, I felt the loss of a child. I know what that feels like, which is why I can empathize with what so many of you have been through during this."" She adds: ""In the pain of our loss, my husband's arm was on my back, rubbing my back, and he was saying 'It's going to be OK'. In those moments of darkness you grab onto any glimmer of hope you can. ""And we did, we found strength in each other, we found strength in the support of each other, in the community."" Harry adds: ""I've learned there's a hole in my heart that I think will never heal. I feel it every day, and I feel it for my wife because I can't imagine how it must feel to lose a child. ""But I've learned through this process that you need to grieve before you can heal. And our culture doesn't really allow us to grieve."" The couple say they want the podcast to be a ""safe space"" for people to share their experiences and connect with each other.

Mental health: Pregnancy,"Smaller studies echo this finding. It is also clear many women experience stress, anxiety and other forms of emotional distress and mental illness at different points during pregnancy. A study based on data from over 3,000 women in England, Wales and Scotland reported a third (33%) of pregnant women screened had high levels of antenatal psychological distress. Around 7% of women are likely to experience antenatal depression, meaning depression during pregnancy. This is the most common maternal mental health problem experienced during pregnancy and in the year after birth. Symptoms of antenatal depression are similar to those of depression at other times, such as low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in weight or appetite, sleep disturbance, tiredness, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, and thoughts of harming oneself or the baby. Antenatal depression can be caused by a combination of factors, such as hormonal changes, life events and the psychological well-being of the expectant mother, especially experiences of stress, anxiety and a lack of social support. If left untreated, antenatal depression can significantly impact the mother's physical and mental health, as well as the health and development of the baby. It is important for women to be aware of the symptoms of antenatal depression and to seek help from their doctor, midwife or health visitor if they are concerned. There are effective treatments available, such as talking therapies and medication, which can help to manage symptoms and improve outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Other mental health conditions that can affect women during pregnancy include anxiety disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and psychosis. These conditions can have a significant impact on the mother's well-being and her ability to cope with pregnancy and motherhood. Treatment for these conditions may include talking therapies, medication and self-help strategies. It is important for women to know that they are not alone if they experience mental health problems during pregnancy or after birth. There is help and support available, and with the right treatment and support, it is possible to manage these conditions and have a positive pregnancy and birth experience.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Plan for Scottish opt-out organ donation system published,"At present, people must opt in to the system in order to donate their organs for transplants after they die. Under the proposals published at the Scottish Parliament, it will be assumed people were in favour of donation, unless they specifically register an objection. This opt-out system has been running successfully in Wales since 2015, and similar legislation is being considered in England and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government says the opt-out system is needed to increase the number of organs available for transplant and save lives. The proposals have been welcomed by some charities, but they have also been met with some opposition. Some people have argued that the opt-out system could lead to people's organs being taken without their consent. Others have argued that it could be seen as a form of coercion. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will include a number of safeguards to ensure that people's wishes are respected. For example, people will be able to easily register an objection to organ donation. They will also be able to change their minds at any time. The Scottish government has also said that the new system will be subject to regular review. The opt-out system is a controversial issue, but it is one that is likely to be debated for some time to come. In the meantime, it is important to remember that organ donation is a gift that can save lives. If you are able to donate, please consider doing so. What are the benefits of an opt-out organ donation system? There are a number of potential benefits to an opt-out organ donation system. These include: It could increase the number of organs available for transplant. This is because more people would be assumed to be in favour of donation, unless they specifically registered an objection. It could save lives. More organs available for transplant would mean that more people could receive life-saving transplants. It could reduce the waiting time for transplants. With more organs available, people would have to wait less time for a transplant. What are the concerns about an opt-out organ donation system? There are also a number of concerns about an opt-out organ donation system. These include: It could lead to people's organs being taken without their consent. This is a concern that is often raised by people who oppose opt-out systems. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will include a number of safeguards to ensure that people's wishes are respected. It could be seen as a form of coercion. Some people argue that an opt-out system could be seen as a form of coercion, as it would place the onus on people to opt out of donation rather than opt in. However, the Scottish government has said that the new system will be voluntary and that people will be able to easily register an objection to organ donation. What is the next step? The Scottish government will now consider the feedback it receives on the proposals. It will then publish a final report on its plans. The opt-out system is likely to be debated for some time to come. However, it is important to remember that organ donation is a gift that can save lives.

The BBC has approached the White House for a response to the reports, but has yet to receive a reply. The NHS is a publicly funded health care system in the United Kingdom. It provides free or low-cost healthcare to all UK residents. The NHS is one of the largest healthcare systems in the world, with over 1.3 million employees. The NHS is a popular institution in the UK. A 2018 poll found that 83% of Britons are satisfied with the NHS. However, the NHS is facing a number of challenges, including rising costs and an aging population. The Conservative Party has pledged to increase funding for the NHS. However, it is unclear how the NHS will be affected by Brexit. The UK government has said that it will not compromise the NHS in any trade deal with the US. The US healthcare system is very different from the NHS. In the US, healthcare is provided by private insurance companies. This means that people who cannot afford insurance may not be able to get healthcare. The US healthcare system is also much more expensive than the NHS. The reports that Mr Trump wants to dismantle the NHS have caused alarm among many people in the UK. However, it is important to note that these reports are based on anonymous sources. It is possible that Mr Trump does not actually want to dismantle the NHS. It is also important to note that the NHS is a very popular institution in the UK. Any attempt to dismantle the NHS would likely be met with strong opposition from the British public.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Francois Fillon's wife facing payment investigation,"It comes after Le Canard Enchaine claimed Penelope Fillon earned about 500,000 euros (£430,000) as her husband's assistant in Parliament. The newspaper has questioned how much work was actually carried out. Mr Fillon, who is running to be France's next president, denies any wrongdoing. He has said that his wife played an ""essential"" role and that she earned about 600 euros (£520) a month. The investigation is being supervised by the French financial prosecutor and could result in charges being brought. If convicted, Mrs Fillon could face up to 10 years in prison. The scandal has been a major blow to Mr Fillon's campaign. He was once seen as the frontrunner in the race to become president, but his support has now dwindled. He is currently trailing his rival, Emmanuel Macron, in the polls. The Fillon affair has also raised questions about the accountability of politicians. Critics have accused Mr Fillon of abusing his position and of using public money to enrich his family. They have also called for tougher laws to prevent such scandals in the future. The scandal has also reignited the debate about the role of women in politics. Some have argued that Mrs Fillon's case shows that women are still not treated as equals in the political world. Others have said that her case should not be used to justify discrimination against women. The Fillon affair is a complex and controversial case that has raised important questions about accountability, transparency, and the role of women in politics. It is a scandal that is likely to have a lasting impact on French society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Houston Flood: Tillerson thanks Mexico for aid offer,"On Sunday Mexico offered vehicles, boats, supplies, and food, reports said. Mexican Red Cross volunteers have also traveled to the flooded city of Houston. President Trump has not yet commented but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson thanked Mexico for the aid. ""We thank the government of Mexico for its generous offer of support and assistance to the people of Houston, Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey,"" Tillerson said in a statement. ""Mexico has been a steadfast partner in our efforts to respond to natural disasters and we are deeply grateful for their friendship and support."" The aid offer from Mexico comes as the death toll from Hurricane Harvey continues to rise. The storm has dumped historic amounts of rain on Houston and the surrounding area, causing widespread flooding. The storm has also knocked out power to over 1 million people and has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. The response to Hurricane Harvey has been a massive undertaking, involving federal, state, and local agencies, as well as numerous non-profit organizations. The Mexican Red Cross is one of the many organizations that have stepped up to help. ""The Mexican Red Cross has a long history of providing humanitarian aid in times of disaster,"" said Fernando Suinaga, president of the Mexican Red Cross. ""We are committed to helping the people of Houston recover from this devastating storm."" The Mexican Red Cross is one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world. It has over 25,000 volunteers and staff who provide a wide range of services, including emergency response, disaster relief, and health care.

Chelsea fans cheer as team parades Champions League trophy,"The team, on two open-top buses, began the procession from its Stamford Bridge home up to Parsons Green. The Blues secured victory in a clash with Manchester City in Porto on 29 May, and will be hoping to continue their success in August's Super Cup, where they will face Europa League winners Villarreal. Chelsea completed a sensational Champions League triumph on Saturday night as Kai Havertz's first-half goal earned a 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the final. Victory in Porto ensured Thomas Tuchel's side ended a 19-year wait to be crowned champions of Europe for the second time. The German has masterminded Chelsea's success since arriving in January following the sacking of club legend Frank Lampard. Tuchel hailed his team's ""huge effort"" and ""great performance"" and said he was ""very proud"" of his players. ""It's a special moment because we shared it with the fans back home,"" he told reporters. ""I feel part of the Chelsea family. We won it together. It was a tough year but we did it. We never lost hope."" Captain Cesar Azpilicueta said: ""This is a special moment. This is what we work for every single day. We knew it would be really tough against one of the best teams in the world and we kept fighting until the end.""

Abuse inquiry: Legal action threat from 'left out' survivors,"By Reevel Alderson BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Survivors group White Flowers Alba said it was seeking a judicial review because the inquiry will not look at their cases. It claimed this was ""unfair"" as similar investigations elsewhere in the UK have included cases dating back decades. The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) is examining historical child abuse in care homes, schools, and other institutions from 1932 onwards. However, it will not be investigating cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. This has angered some survivors and campaigners, who believe the SCAI should examine all cases of abuse, regardless of when they happened or whether they have been investigated before. White Flowers Alba is representing around 20 people who were abused in care in the 1950s and 1960s. It claims that the SCAI's decision not to investigate their cases is ""unfair"" and ""discriminatory."" The group has been given permission to seek a judicial review of the SCAI's decision. A judicial review is a court hearing where a judge examines the decision-making process of a public body to see if it was lawful and reasonable. If the judge finds that the SCAI's decision was unlawful or unreasonable, it could quash the decision and order the SCAI to reconsider. The Scottish government said it was ""aware"" of the legal challenge and would ""defend"" the SCAI's decision. A spokesperson said: ""The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry is independent of the Scottish government. ""The inquiry has decided that it will not investigate cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. ""This decision was taken in order to ensure that the inquiry does not duplicate the work of other investigations and to avoid prejudicing any ongoing legal proceedings."" The SCAI has said it is ""committed to investigating all allegations of child abuse in Scotland."" However, it has said that it cannot investigate cases that have already been examined by other inquiries or are the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings. The inquiry has said it will consider investigating cases that have not been examined by other inquiries or are not the subject of ongoing police investigations or legal proceedings.

Police Ombudsman to resume RUC misconduct investigations,"Investigations were suspended in 2011 after a critical report into the running of the office. The report found that the independence of the office had been compromised. The Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland is an independent body that investigates complaints against the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The ombudsman's office was established in 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement. In 2011, a critical report into the running of the Police Ombudsman's office found that the independence of the office had been compromised. The report made a number of recommendations, including that the ombudsman should be appointed by an independent panel, and that the office should be given more resources. The Police Ombudsman has now announced that it will resume investigations into RUC misconduct. The ombudsman's office has said that it has put in place a number of measures to address the concerns raised in the 2011 report, and that it is now confident that it can conduct independent and impartial investigations. The decision to resume investigations into RUC misconduct has been welcomed by a number of victims' groups. However, some police officers have expressed concerns about the ombudsman's independence, and have said that they fear they could be unfairly targeted by investigations. The Police Ombudsman's office is an important part of the justice system in Northern Ireland. It is essential that the ombudsman is independent and impartial, and that it has the resources to carry out its work effectively. The decision to resume investigations into RUC misconduct is a positive step, but it is important to remember that the ombudsman's office still faces a number of challenges. One of the challenges facing the ombudsman's office is the lack of funding. The ombudsman's office has been underfunded for a number of years, and this has made it difficult to recruit and retain staff. The ombudsman's office has also been criticized for being too slow to investigate complaints. In some cases, it has taken years for the ombudsman to complete an investigation. Another challenge facing the ombudsman's office is the lack of public confidence. Some people have lost confidence in the ombudsman's office, and they believe that it is not independent or impartial. The ombudsman's office needs to do more to build public confidence, and it needs to demonstrate that it is committed to investigating complaints fairly and impartially. The Police Ombudsman's office is an important part of the justice system in Northern Ireland. It is essential that the ombudsman is independent and impartial, and that it has the resources to carry out its work effectively.

Infant classes over 30 almost treble in five years,"By Judith Burns BBC News education reporter Some 72,000 infant pupils in England are now in large classes, up from 24,700 in 2008, suggests data from the Department for Education (DfE). The previous government had pledged to reduce the number of pupils in infant classes with more than 30 students, but the number has almost tripled in five years. The DfE data shows: > GCSE results: Benchmark for 4 and 5 grades falls by 0.3% > University applications: Scottish applicants to English universities rise > Is your school living on borrowed time? The National Union of Teachers (NUT) said the figures ""beggared belief"". But a DfE spokesman said many schools used larger classes in infant classes because it worked best for them. The DfE data shows that the number of year 1 and year 2 pupils in classes of more than 30 has almost trebled in the past five years. In 2008, just 3.8% were being taught in classes of this size, but by 2013, this had risen to 10.7%. The government had aimed to reduce this figure to 10% by 2015. Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the NUT, said: ""We know large classes impact on the ability of teachers to give individual attention and support to their pupils, and it impacts on children's progress and achievement."" He said the ""astounding"" rise in large infant classes was down to the fact that the government had cut funding for schools. ""What we want to see is a reduction in class sizes for all pupils, so that teachers can give individual attention to the children in their class,"" he added. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) also expressed concern about the rise in large infant classes. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, said: ""The government must reverse its policy of cutting funding to schools, which has forced heads to reduce class sizes."" She added: ""We know that smaller class sizes help pupils to learn more effectively and achieve better grades."" However, a DfE spokesman said the government had protected funding for schools. He said: ""Many schools choose to use larger classes in infant classes, because they are best placed to make judgments about what works best for the children they teach.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

"Alun Cairns: Trial row ex-minister paid £16,000 after resignation","A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan MP said the payment was ""in common with the departure of every minister"". Mr Cairns resigned in November over allegations of ""disloyalty"" to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The news comes after it was revealed that former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson received a £24,000 severance payment when he resigned in December over allegations of paid lobbying. The payments have raised questions about the government's commitment to transparency and accountability. Labour MP Jon Ashworth said the payments were ""a disgrace"" and called on the government to ""stop the gravy train"". ""These payments are a slap in the face to taxpayers,"" he said. ""They show that the government is more interested in looking after its own than in serving the public."" The Conservative Party has defended the payments, saying that they are ""in line with long-standing practice"". A spokesman for the party said: ""These payments are made to cover the costs of winding up ministerial duties and are not a bonus or a reward."" However, the payments have been criticized by some Conservative MPs. Former minister David Davis said that the payments were ""not a good look"" and called on the government to ""rethink"" its policy. ""I think it's a mistake to make these payments,"" he said. ""It sends the wrong message to the public."" The controversy over the payments is likely to continue in the coming weeks. The government is facing pressure to review its policy on severance payments for ministers. It is also facing calls to be more transparent about the use of public money.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Peckham baby death attack: Accused 'not ready to be father',"Malorie Bantala, 22, from Peckham, suffered life-threatening injuries and gave birth at 32 weeks to a stillborn boy following the attack. Kevin Wilson, and a 17-year-old boy, allegedly wore helmets and attacked her when she refused to give them money. Wilson has pleaded not guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing a child to be born prematurely. The 17-year-old boy has also denied the charges. The court heard that Bantala was walking home from a friend's house when the pair approached her and asked her for money. When she refused, Wilson allegedly beckoned for the younger teenager to ""go get the helmet"". The younger boy went to a nearby shop and returned with a helmet bearing the logo of a motorbike delivery company. CCTV cameras show Wilson putting on the helmet as he approached Bantala. He then allegedly used it to strike her on the head. ""She was knocked unconscious and left with a fractured skull,"" said prosecutor Richard Sutton. The 17-year-old boy then allegedly used the helmet to smash a car window, while Wilson kicked and punched Bantala as she lay unconscious. Bantala was rushed to hospital where she gave birth to a stillborn baby boy named Joshua. She had been 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the attack. A medical report revealed that Bantala had suffered multiple skull fractures, a bleed on the brain, and a broken nose. Her unborn baby had died as a result of a placental abruption, caused by the blunt force trauma to Bantala's abdomen. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Bantala said: ""I have been left with life-changing injuries. I have metal plates in my skull and I have to wear a helmet to protect my brain every time I go out. ""I have nightmares about what happened and I have flashbacks.

Ipswich Hospital 'now meets standards' - CQC,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the hospital was fully compliant in the areas they inspected in July.

The CQC said the hospital was now providing ""safe, effective, compassionate and responsive care"". They also praised the hospital for its ""positive culture"" and its ""commitment to providing high-quality care"". The hospital's chief executive, Andrew Reed, said he was ""delighted"" with the CQC's findings. He said the hospital had worked hard to improve its standards and the report was a ""testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff"". The CQC's inspection was part of a wider review of the quality of care at hospitals in England. The CQC found that the majority of hospitals were providing good or outstanding care, but there were still some areas where improvements were needed. The CQC's chief executive, David Behan, said: ""The NHS is facing significant challenges, but we are seeing improvements in the quality of care at many hospitals. This is thanks to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, who are committed to providing the best possible care for their patients."" The CQC's report on Ipswich Hospital is a positive sign that the hospital is continuing to improve.

Zimbabwe media slow to cover military takeover,"By BBC Monitoring The world through its media State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that the military had taken over but offered little by way of analysis or context. Independent newspapers and websites carried the story prominently as the main event. Some had little detail while others carried full transcripts of the statement made by the major-general. The privately-owned NewsDay, the first newspaper to be printed after the takeover, carried a front-page editorial comment on the military's intervention under the heading: ""Zimbabwe now on edge"". The paper's editor, Wisdom Mdzungairi, said: ""We are witnessing the demise of a dictatorship that has been aided and abetted by an incompetent government which has presided over years of grand-scale corruption, maladministration and economic meltdown."" He added that many people had not been surprised by the military's intervention, but he called on the military leaders to move quickly ""to restore stability and legitimacy"". Another privately-owned newspaper, the Daily News, also published a transcript of the major-general's statement under the headline: ""Army steps in to end Mugabe's rule."" However, the paper's website carried much more - including speculation over possible motives for the military intervention. It quoted former cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo as saying that the military was likely to be unhappy with the first lady Grace Mugabe's ""monopoly"" over her husband. It also carried reports of violence in Harare's central business district on Wednesday where the army had clashed with supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party. The online version of the Standard newspaper said the army had denied these reports and that there had been no violence. However, another privately-owned newspaper, the Zimbabwe Independent, said that ""soldiers ran amok"" in the capital, attacking people in company attire and searching cars. The paper also quoted businessman and political analyst, Trevor Ncube, as saying it was time for Zimbabwe to move on and embrace a ""new dispensation"". The online edition of the privately-owned Financial Gazette carried the transcript of the major-general's statement. It also carried articles on the international reaction to the military intervention and the implications for the country's economy. There was also an article headlined: ""Mugabe resigns: End of an era"", which described the president's rise and fall and the political turmoil that had engulfed the country in recent months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine,"By James Gallagher Health and science correspondent The UK's medicines safety regulator says there have been 242 clotting cases and 49 deaths, with 28.5 million doses of the vaccine administered. But the risk is slightly higher in younger people. Most of the cases have occurred in younger people - three-quarters of the cases have been in people under 50. The problem has been linked to the vaccine triggering an unusual immune response which causes clotting. There are two other effective vaccines being used in the UK - Moderna and Pfizer. Experts say these use slightly different technology that has not been linked to this rare clotting problem. This is why the recommendation is only for under-40s. The JCVI says the small number of blood clots means the overall benefits of vaccination in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks. It says the advice will be kept under review as more data becomes available. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said: ""This is a risk-benefit decision and we have decided that the balance of risk and benefit favours the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in adults under 40."" Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, said: ""The JCVI has advised that adults aged 30 and over who have not yet received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine. ""We have also advised that adults aged 18-29 years who have not yet received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine."" The JCVI says that those who have already had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still receive a second dose of the same vaccine. This is because the risk of a blood clot after the first dose is much lower than the risk of Covid-19. It also says that there is no need to test people for clotting disorders before they get a Covid vaccine. The JCVI's advice is based on the latest data on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It says that the data shows that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Sea search for Brighton woman is called off,"Coastguards said it was thought a couple entered the sea after a night out and the woman was swept away. Rescue teams were scrambled overnight and an extensive air and sea operation was launched, involving lifeboats from Brighton, Shoreham, Littlehampton, Newhaven and Eastbourne. However, by Saturday evening, the search for the woman had been called off, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. A spokesperson said: ""The decision has been made to stand down the search operation as no further evidence has been found to locate the person who entered the water in the early hours of this morning."" A Sussex Police spokesperson said: ""Police are making enquiries regarding the circumstances and are in contact with the family."" The search operation involved multiple agencies including the Coastguard, police and fire and rescue services. An RNLI lifeboat crew member described the rescue efforts as ""tragic"". ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends,"" they said. ""It is heart-breaking when there is a loss of life."" The incident comes just weeks after a man died after jumping into the sea from Brighton Palace Pier with his dog. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has issued a warning to the public about the dangers of entering the sea at night. An MCA spokesperson said: ""Entering the water at night, even on a calm sea, can have tragic consequences. The water can be much colder than expected, which can reduce your ability to swim. The sea can also be unpredictable, and currents can quickly carry you away from safety."" The MCA advises people to always swim at a lifeguarded beach, and to never enter the water alone.

Fiscal Phil's Budget - is it just about the cash?,"David Cornock Parliamentary correspondent, Wales The Budget throws up more than enough to last a lifetime. And when there's not much money around, politicians tend to begin the vital process of kicking the can down the road. In Rishi Sunak's first outing as Chancellor of the Exchequer, there was some trust-me jam tomorrow. Fiscal Phil, as some have started calling him, is a can-kicker extraordinaire. Here is a brief list of things the UK government will be doing: 1. Borrowing £355bn to fund the package of measures 2. Raising corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023 3. Freezing income tax personal allowances and higher rate threshold 4. Cutting Universal Credit by £20 a week 5. Setting up a new UK Infrastructure Bank 6. Spending £12bn on the Restart programme to create jobs 7. Providing £15bn for the NHS 8. Investing £5bn in new bus and cycle lanes 9. Confirming that HS2 will be completed 10. Increasing the minimum wage to £9.50 an hour for over-23s There has been much criticism of the detail in the package but the broad effect is clear. Rishi Sunak is attempting to limit the impact of the economic shock that followed the pandemic. He is doing that by holding off on tax rises and borrowing more to keep spending levels very high. He is using the Infrastructure Bank and the Restart scheme to create jobs. And he is protecting the NHS and other public services from the full force of the spending cuts. This is all very expensive. The Chancellor has increased borrowing to record levels. It means that the government will now have to borrow more than £2,000 every second over the next five years just to pay the interest on the UK's vast debts. However, the Chancellor argues that the alternative would be even more painful. Without this support, the UK economy would shrink by 6% over the next two years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Unemployment would reach almost 12%, the worst recession seen in the UK for three centuries. And public services would have to be slashed to the bone. The Chancellor is gambling that the economic recovery will be strong enough to allow him to pay down the debt in the future. But if the recovery is slower than expected, the UK will be left with a very expensive hangover. The Budget has been welcomed by some economists, who argue that it was necessary to prevent a deep recession. Others have criticized the package as being too expensive and unfair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the Budget was ""regressive"", meaning it would hit the poorest in society hardest. The Resolution Foundation think tank said the Budget did not do enough to help low-income families. The government has argued that the Budget is fair because it includes a number of measures to help low-income families, such as increasing the minimum wage and spending more on childcare. However, the IFS said that these measures were not enough to offset the regressive impact of other measures, such as freezing income tax personal allowances and cutting Universal Credit. The Budget is a complex and controversial package of measures. It is too early to say whether it will be successful in preventing a deep recession. But it is clear that the UK government is taking a big gamble with the country's finances.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

L'Origine du Monde: Mystery Courbet nude uncovered 150 years on,"Now a French scholar may have solved the mystery of whose body was painted so explicitly in his 1866 work, not exhibited publicly in France till 1991. The subject of Courbet's work was for years assumed to be his mistress, Constance Queniaux. But art historian Louis-Édouard Fourcaut has recently put forward a new theory - it was actually Courbet's sister Zoé. Fourcaut has been working on this theory since 2014, when he began to compare the painting to other works by Courbet, including a portrait of Zoé that he painted in 1860. He noticed similarities in the way the two women's bodies were depicted, and in particular the way their pubic hair was rendered. Further research revealed that Zoé was living with Courbet at the time he painted L'Origine du Monde, and that she had posed for him on several other occasions. Fourcaut also found evidence that Zoé was a lesbian, which may have made her more willing to pose for such an explicit painting. If Fourcaut's theory is correct, it would mean that L'Origine du Monde is not merely a depiction of female sexuality, but also a celebration of lesbian love. This would be a significant finding, as it would be one of the few surviving examples of lesbian art from the 19th century. Fourcaut's theory has been met with some skepticism by other art historians, who argue that there is not enough evidence to prove that Zoé was the model for L'Origine du Monde. However, the theory has also generated a great deal of interest, and it is likely to be debated for many years to come. Regardless of who the model was, L'Origine du Monde remains a powerful and controversial work of art. It is a celebration of female sexuality and a challenge to traditional notions of beauty and morality. It is a reminder that art can be both beautiful and transgressive, and that it can still shock and surprise us today.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Collingham fire: Boy, 5, is third family member to die","The children's mother, aged 28, is also in hospital in a stable condition. The fire service said they were called at 2.56am on Saturday and arrived at the house within five minutes. The cause of the fire is being investigated. Christopher Hairs, from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, said the service was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths and would be offering support to the family. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have died,"" he said. ""We would like to thank all those who have helped in any way following this tragic incident."" The family's local MP, Robert Jenrick, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the victims,"" he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy and I want to offer my condolences to all those affected."" The local community has rallied around the family, with a fundraising page set up to help them. The page has already raised over £10,000. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""It's such a sad story. The family is lovely and it's just heartbreaking what has happened."" Another neighbour said: ""The community is in shock. We just can't believe what has happened. We are all thinking of the family and friends of the victims."" The fire service has urged people to check their smoke alarms and make sure they have a fire escape plan in place. Mr Hairs said: ""Smoke alarms save lives.

Spy agency turns to AI to tackle child abuse,"Gordon Corera Security correspondent, BBC News @gordoncorera on Twitter The UK's adversaries were already using the technology, it said. The agency has published a paper, Ethics of AI: Pioneering a New Chapter in the Fight Against Online Child Sexual Abuse, that explores the development and use of AI to tackle child sexual abuse material (CSAM) more effectively. The paper outlines how MI5 has worked with the National Crime Agency and tech companies to develop AI-powered tools that can automatically detect and remove CSAM from the internet. These tools have been used to take down hundreds of thousands of images and videos of child abuse, and have helped to identify and prosecute offenders. MI5's director general, Ken McCallum, said that the use of AI was ""a game-changer"" in the fight against child sexual abuse. ""This is a truly horrific crime that destroys lives,"" he said. ""We must use every tool at our disposal to stop it."" The agency's paper also addresses the ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in this field. It says that MI5 is committed to using AI in a way that is ""proportionate, necessary, and fair."" The paper also sets out a number of safeguards to ensure that AI is not used to target innocent people. These include: Ensuring that AI tools are only used to identify CSAM, and not other types of content. Subjecting AI tools to rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure that they are accurate and reliable. Providing human oversight of all AI-powered decisions. The agency's paper is a significant step forward in the fight against child sexual abuse. It shows how AI can be used to make a real difference in protecting children from this horrific crime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Cost of dying 'rose more than 10% last year',"The average cost of services including probate, headstones, flowers and the burial or cremation fee is now £8,427, according to insurer SunLife. The average cost of a funeral has increased by 87% since the survey was first conducted. The research, which surveyed 2,000 people, found that the cost of dying has risen by more than 10% in the past year alone. The biggest increases were seen in the cost of probate, which rose by 15%, and the cost of headstones, which rose by 12%. The cost of dying is a significant financial burden for many families, and it is only going to get worse in the future. As the population ages, the number of deaths is expected to increase, and this will put further pressure on funeral costs. There are a number of things that people can do to reduce the cost of dying. One option is to take out a funeral plan, which can help to cover the costs of a funeral in advance. Another option is to choose a more affordable funeral option, such as a direct cremation. Whatever option you choose, it is important to plan ahead for the cost of dying. By doing so, you can help to ensure that your family is not left with a large financial burden when you pass away. Here are some tips for reducing the cost of dying: Take out a funeral plan. Funeral plans can help to cover the costs of a funeral in advance, and they can often be purchased for a monthly fee. Choose a more affordable funeral option. There are a number of different funeral options available, and some are more affordable than others. For example, a direct cremation is a more affordable option than a traditional funeral. Ask for help from friends and family. If you are struggling to pay for a funeral, you can ask for help from friends and family. They may be able to help you with the costs of the funeral, or they may be able to provide emotional support. Consider a crowdfunding campaign. If you are unable to pay for a funeral, you can consider starting a crowdfunding campaign. This can be a way to raise money from friends, family, and other people who want to help.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting?","Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting? Bullfighting is a ""supremely dangerous art"", says Garry Marvin, professor of human-animal studies at Queen's University, Ontario. ""It's not just the risk of being gored or trampled, but also the psychological and emotional toll it takes on the participants."" Who is at risk? The most obvious people at risk are the matadors, who face the bulls in the ring. But other participants are also at risk, including the banderilleros, who place barbed sticks in the bull's neck, and the picadors, who lance the bull on horseback. Even spectators can be injured, as bulls have been known to jump the barriers and into the stands. What are the injuries? Bullfighting injuries can be severe and even fatal. Matadors can suffer from goring, trampling, and other blunt force trauma. Banderilleros and picadors can also suffer from serious injuries, including broken bones and puncture wounds. Spectators have been known to be gored, trampled, and even killed by bulls. Why is bullfighting dangerous? Bullfighting is dangerous because it involves interacting with a large, powerful, and unpredictable animal. Bulls are capable of inflicting serious injuries with their horns, hooves, and body weight. They are also very agile and can move quickly and unpredictably. This makes it difficult for matadors and other participants to avoid being injured. How can the risks be reduced? There are a number of ways to reduce the risks associated with bullfighting. One is to use more protective gear, such as helmets, chest plates, and leg guards. Another is to train matadors and other participants more thoroughly. Finally, the rules of the sport can be changed to make it less dangerous. For example, the use of swords could be banned, and the bulls could be given more space to escape. Is bullfighting worth the risk? The question of whether or not bullfighting is worth the risk is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they believe that the sport is worth the risks involved.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

HMV saved: Music fans and employees give their verdict,"By Steve Holden Newsbeat reporter in Manchester The company has been in administration since the beginning of 2013 after problems in the face of online competition. Hilco has acquired 132 HMV shops, including its flagship store on Oxford Street. The deal secures more than 2,500 jobs, but 27 stores will close. In Manchester, news that the Arndale store has been saved was welcomed by shoppers. Sean, a musician, told Newsbeat: ""It gives a sense of community, a sense of belonging, knowing there's a place you can go and see new artists and old artists. ""They do so much to help up-and-coming artists and they give people the chance to hear new music. It's a real asset to the city."" Employee Leanne said: ""I'm really happy to be staying. I knew there was a chance I would lose my job and it would have been hard to find another job. ""The customers are why I do the job. I've had very few rude people in the eight years I've been here. It's a lively working environment and that makes it a really good place to work."" In London, Newsbeat spoke to Sainsbury's employee John, who was browsing the HMV store on Oxford Street. He said: ""I like coming here. It's an iconic store. I like the choice of music, it's very extensive. ""It's not just music they sell here. They also stock films and other entertainment products. It's a convenient shopping experience."" HMV began life as a record shop in 1921. It later expanded into other areas such as DVDs, games consoles and technology. In recent years, the company has faced increasing competition from online retailers such as Amazon. It has also been hit by the decline in CD sales.

A-level exam 'leak': Belfast grammar pupils sanctioned,"The schools have declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but a spokesperson for the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said: ""We can confirm that a small number of students from two schools have been subject to a penalty for malpractice in the June 2022 A-level examinations."" ""The CCEA takes all allegations of malpractice very seriously and investigates all cases thoroughly,"" the spokesperson added. ""Where malpractice is proven, the CCEA has a range of penalties available, including the cancellation of results or the disqualification of students from future examinations."" The news comes after a number of high-profile cases of exam cheating in recent years. In 2019, it was reported that over 100 students in England had their A-level results cancelled after they were found to have used unauthorized materials in their exams. In response to the growing problem of exam cheating, the CCEA has introduced a number of new measures to deter students from engaging in malpractice. These measures include: Increased use of invigilators and surveillance cameras Random searches of students and their belongings The use of software to detect plagiarism The CCEA is also working with schools to raise awareness of the consequences of exam cheating and to encourage students to report any suspicious activity. Despite these measures, it is clear that exam cheating remains a problem. The CCEA's recent announcement is a reminder that students who engage in malpractice will be punished. It is important to note that the nine students affected by the CCEA's investigation represent a very small minority of the thousands of students who took A-level exams in June 2022. The vast majority of students are honest and hardworking, and they deserve to have their achievements recognized. Exam cheating is a serious issue, but it is important to keep it in perspective.

Will Brexit last longer than other winning words of the year?,"The word had its first recorded use in 2013 but as the EU referendum approached, more and more people started using it. It's an increase that Collins says is ""unheard of"". But Brexit is not the first word to have been popularised by a major political event. In 2016, Oxford Dictionaries named ""post-truth"" as its word of the year, reflecting the growing trend towards people shaping their political beliefs around emotion rather than facts. And in 2017, Merriam-Webster's word of the year was ""feminism"", reflecting the growing prominence of the feminist movement in popular culture. So, could Brexit be another short-lived phenomenon? It's certainly possible. Political language often changes rapidly, as new events and ideas emerge. For example, the word ""austerity"" was relatively obscure before the 2008 financial crisis, but it quickly became a household term as governments around the world implemented cuts to public spending. However, it's also possible that Brexit could stick around for longer. The UK's withdrawal from the EU is a complex and unprecedented process, and it could have a major impact on British society for many years to come. As a result, it's likely that people will continue to use the word Brexit to describe the process and its consequences. Of course, it's impossible to say for sure how long Brexit will remain in the public consciousness. However, it's clear that the word has already had a major impact on the English language. It has become a shorthand way of describing the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and it has also entered the wider political lexicon as a term for a major political upheaval. Whether Brexit will continue to be used for decades to come remains to be seen. But for now, it seems clear that the word is here to stay for the foreseeable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Garden eels 'forgetting about humans' need people to video-chat,"Keepers at Tokyo's Sumida Aquarium, which has been closed since 1 March due to the coronavirus pandemic, are starting to worry about their garden eels. The sensitive little creatures had become used to seeing hundreds of faces peering into their tank every day, and now they're starting to forget about humans. ""They're not used to seeing people anymore, so they're starting to lose their trust in us,"" said aquarium keeper Rina Ono. ""They used to come up to the surface and say hello, but now they're hiding in their burrows."" The garden eels are not the only animals at the aquarium that are being affected by the lack of visitors. The penguins are also starting to get restless, and the sea otters are spending more time sleeping. ""All of our animals are social creatures, so they're used to interacting with people,"" said Ono. ""It's hard for them to understand why we're not around anymore."" The aquarium staff is trying to keep the animals entertained and engaged, but it's not the same as having visitors around. ""We're doing everything we can to make sure they're happy and healthy,"" said Ono. ""But we can't replace the interaction they get from people."" The aquarium is hoping to reopen soon, but it's not clear when that will be. In the meantime, the staff is asking people to video-chat with the animals. ""It's not the same as being here in person, but it's a way for people to connect with the animals and show them that they're still loved,"" said Ono. To video-chat with the animals, visit the Sumida Aquarium website. You can choose to chat with the penguins, the sea otters, or the garden eels.

Coronavirus: Bat scientists find new evidence,"They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand. And blood tests from nearby villagers revealed that some had antibodies which may have been the result of a previous infection with a bat coronavirus. This suggests that the virus could have spread from bats to humans, although more research is needed to show whether this definitely happened. The Thai researchers say their findings ""support the hypothesis that bats could be the natural reservoir for the Covid-19 virus"". But experts say we may never know for sure whether bats were the original source of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. There are lots of different viruses in bats but only a handful have been known to infect humans, and most cause mild symptoms. But the Sars and Mers coronaviruses, which have both led to deadly outbreaks in the past two decades, originated in bats. Bats are thought to be the most likely hosts of the new coronavirus because they are mammals like us and they are known to carry coronaviruses. The Thai researchers collected samples of saliva and faeces from 649 bats in Thailand between June 2020 and May 2021. They tested more than 300 samples and identified nine different coronaviruses. One of them was a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans. The researchers say it is the closest match between a coronavirus in bats and the Covid virus yet identified. They also collected blood samples from 829 people living near the wildlife sanctuary. More than 10% tested positive for antibodies to a coronavirus. This means they had already been exposed to a coronavirus. The researchers speculate that exposure to bats may be the cause. However, they admit that the blood tests could be picking up antibodies to other coronaviruses and not the virus that causes Covid-19. More research is needed to determine whether these people were infected with the novel coronavirus. The researchers say their work highlights the risk of bat coronaviruses getting into humans. They are calling for greater surveillance and more research to understand bat viruses. They also say it is important to protect bat habitats.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Saudi Arabia hosts its first ever women's cycle race,"By Paul Harrison BBC UGC and Social News Saudi women cyclists were able to compete in a race held in the city of Jeddah on Tuesday. Forty-seven women took part in the event, which covered a distance of 10km. The race was organized by the Saudi Cycling Federation and was the first of its kind to be held in the country. One of the participants, Samah al-Hamdan, said that she was delighted to be able to take part in the race. ""I'm so happy that I was able to participate in this race,"" she said. ""It's a great opportunity for women in Saudi Arabia to show that we can do anything that men can do."" Another participant, Aseel al-Zahrani, said that she hoped the race would inspire other women to take up cycling. ""I hope that this race will encourage more women to get involved in cycling,"" she said. ""It's a great way to stay healthy and active."" The race was held in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, which is known for its relaxed atmosphere. The event was widely praised by human rights groups, who said that it was a sign of progress for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. ""This is a significant step forward for women's rights in Saudi Arabia,"" said Rothna Begum, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""It shows that the government is listening to the demands of women for greater equality."" The race was also praised by social media users, who said that it was a positive sign for the future of Saudi Arabia. ""This is a great day for Saudi Arabia,"" said one user. ""It shows that the country is moving in the right direction."" The race was held under the patronage of Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, who is the president of the Saudi Cycling Federation. Princess Reema is a vocal advocate for women's rights and has been instrumental in promoting cycling among women in Saudi Arabia. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has made a number of reforms to improve women's rights. In 2018, women were granted the right to drive, and in 2019, they were allowed to travel without the permission of a male guardian. These reforms have been welcomed by women's rights groups, who say that they are a sign of progress for women in Saudi Arabia. However, there are still a number of restrictions on women's rights in Saudi Arabia.

Cholera death toll rises in hurricane-hit Haiti,"Fifty-nine people had died up until and including Thursday, and 617 others had been infected, bringing the total affected to 7,359, the ministry added. The news came as aid agencies stepped up their response to a spiralling cholera outbreak triggered by the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, described by the UN as the worst humanitarian crisis to hit Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam, which has been working to bring clean water and sanitation to Haiti since the hurricane, said the situation was becoming increasingly desperate. ""The number of cholera cases is rising rapidly, and the death toll is also climbing,"" said Oxfam's Haiti director Yolette Etienne. ""We are doing everything we can to get clean water and sanitation to those who need it, but it is a huge challenge."" The hurricane destroyed homes and infrastructure, and left many areas without access to clean water or sanitation. This created the ideal conditions for cholera, a waterborne disease that can spread rapidly in unsanitary conditions. Cholera symptoms can include diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration, and can be fatal if not treated quickly. The Haitian government has declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak, and is working with aid agencies to provide clean water and sanitation to those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also providing support, and has sent a team of experts to Haiti to help with the response. The WHO said the situation was ""extremely serious"", and warned that the number of cholera cases could continue to rise in the coming weeks. ""We are doing everything we can to support the Haitian government in its efforts to contain the outbreak,"" said WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier.

The centre-right Junts per Catalunya (JxCat) has seen its support fall to 32 seats from 34, while the far-left Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (CUP) has increased its presence from four to nine seats. The pro-union centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) party has lost 11 seats, falling from 36 to 25, while the Socialists (PSC) have gained five, rising from 17 to 22. Both the conservative Popular Party (PP) and far-right Vox have suffered heavy losses, with the former falling from four to three seats and the latter losing all its 11 seats. The pro-independence parties have welcomed the results, saying they show that the majority of Catalans want a referendum on independence. However, the Spanish government has reiterated that it will not allow a referendum, arguing that it would be unconstitutional. The results are likely to increase tensions between the Catalan government and Madrid, and could reignite the independence movement. Catalonia, a wealthy and populous region in north-eastern Spain, has a long history of seeking independence. In 2017, it held a referendum on independence, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government. The result, which saw a majority in favour of independence, was not recognised by Madrid. The Catalan parliament subsequently declared independence, but this was also rejected by the Spanish government and the region was placed under direct rule from Madrid. In 2018, the Catalan government was reinstated, but tensions between the two sides remain high. The pro-independence movement has continued to push for a referendum, while the Spanish government has refused to grant one. The results of the regional elections are likely to further polarise the debate on independence, and could lead to renewed conflict between the Catalan government and Madrid.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping,"In a legal notice, Clean Air in London asked the mayor to ""delay implementing his decision until he can ensure air pollution is not worsened"". Mr Johnson has promised to get rid of the west London ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) from October 25. The campaign group said it was ""deeply concerned"" that the mayor's decision could lead to more air pollution. The Ulez, which charges drivers of older, more polluting vehicles, has been in operation since 2019 and has been credited with reducing air pollution in central London. A study by King's College London found that the Ulez had led to a 20% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels in central London. The mayor has said that he is scrapping the Ulez because it is ""unfair"" to drivers and is not necessary to improve air quality. However, Clean Air in London said that the mayor's decision was ""based on flawed evidence"" and that it would lead to worse air pollution. The group said that it was ""prepared to take legal action"" if the mayor did not delay implementing his decision. The mayor's office said that it was ""confident"" that the Ulez could be scrapped without worsening air quality. A spokesperson for the mayor said: ""The mayor is committed to improving air quality in London and believes that the Ulez is not the best way to do this."" The spokesperson said that the mayor was ""looking at other ways to improve air quality"" and that he would ""be announcing further details in due course"". The legal challenge to the mayor's decision is likely to be the first of many. Several other groups, including the London Assembly and the Green Party, have also said that they are considering legal action. The legal challenge is likely to focus on the mayor's duty to protect public health. The mayor has a statutory duty to reduce air pollution in London and the legal challenge will argue that scrapping the Ulez will breach this duty. The legal challenge is also likely to focus on the mayor's decision-making process. The legal challenge will argue that the mayor's decision to scrap the Ulez was not based on a proper assessment of the evidence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

They married two years later and have two sons and several grandchildren. But they have lived largely separate lives for years. Mrs Owens says she faced ""verbal and emotional abuse"" from her husband during their marriage. She says she has found love again and wants to be with her new partner. In a statement, she said: ""I am seeking a divorce because I do not believe that I should have to stay trapped in a loveless marriage. It is not right that the courts can force someone to stay married when they do not want to be."" The case has sparked debate about the role of the state in marriage. Some argue that the institution of marriage should be protected and that divorce should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Others say that people should be free to leave unhappy marriages and that the state should not interfere. The Supreme Court is expected to consider Mrs Owens's case later this year. If she is successful, it would be a landmark ruling that could have implications for other couples seeking a divorce. Rights of Women's legal director, Harriet Wistrich, said: ""We are supporting Mrs Owens's application to the Supreme Court because we believe that the law on divorce needs to be reformed. ""It is not right that people can be forced to stay in unhappy marriages. Marriage should be a voluntary union and people should be free to leave it when it is no longer working."" The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said it would be following the case with interest. A spokesman said: ""The Law Society believes that the law on divorce should be reviewed to ensure that it is fair and proportionate. ""We will be interested to see the Supreme Court's decision in this case and how it will affect the way that divorce is dealt with in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Don Lock murder: Mother of accused pleaded for help for son,"Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock died on 30 October 2021, her son was very unwell. She said the defendant told her he had been hearing voices that he described as ""demons"", had stopped taking his prescribed medication and slept on the sofa because he thought someone was trying to get into his room. The court heard Matthew Daley had self-harmed in the past, including cutting his wrist, and his mother feared he was suicidal. ""I was worried about him,"" she said. ""He was not the son I knew."" She told the jury her son was vulnerable, with a history of mental health issues and cannabis use. On the day of the killing, Matthew Daley shouted at her and his father as they drove through Lewes, telling them to pull over so he could be sick. He swore at traffic wardens and started ""acting out"" in the street, Mrs Daley said. She said she and her husband, who died in July this year, were left ""distressed and upset."" Matthew Daley was taken to the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, where his mother says he threatened to kill a nurse. She said her son's mental health worsened after he was discharged from hospital. Jurors heard Mrs Daley called police on the day of the murder, worried about her son's behaviour. ""I wanted him to be sectioned,"" she said. ""He was very unwell."" Her son did not contact her on the day Mr Lock died, she told the court. She found out what had happened on the news and went to the police station. ""I said it was awful what he had done,"" said Mrs Daley. ""I was disgusted."" She added: ""If I thought for one minute that he would hurt somebody, I would have never left him alone."" The trial continues.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fortnite pro Jarvis banned for using cheat software,"Jarvis Khattri was banned for using cheating software while playing the popular game. Fortnite creator Epic imposed the ban even though Mr Khattri used the software on a game account separate to the one he streams on. Mr Khattri, who has 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube and 1.5 million on Twitch, was found to have used software to grant himself advantages in the game. This included aim-assist, which helps players by automatically adjusting their aim, and wallhack, which allows players to see through walls. Epic's ban of Mr Khattri has been met with mixed reactions. Some fans have defended him, arguing that he only used the cheating software on a private server and that he did not intend to gain an unfair advantage in the game. Others have welcomed the ban, arguing that it sends a strong message that cheating will not be tolerated. Epic's decision to ban Mr Khattri is part of a wider crackdown on cheating in Fortnite. The company has previously banned other high-profile players for using cheating software, and it has also implemented a number of measures to make it more difficult to cheat in the game. It is not yet clear whether Mr Khattri will appeal his ban. However, even if he does, it is unlikely that he will be successful. Epic has a strict policy against cheating, and it has shown in the past that it is willing to ban players who violate this policy, regardless of their popularity or status. The ban of Mr Khattri is a reminder that cheating is a serious problem in online gaming. It is also a reminder that even the most popular and successful players are not immune to being banned if they are caught cheating.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Elaine Doyle murder: DNA samples could give clues to death,"Detectives used sticky tape to recover fibers from the dead girl's skin and found traces of DNA from ""an unknown male"" on Elaine's back. Forensic experts believe that this may show there was a sexual assault before she was killed. The new breakthrough comes after a cold case review into Elaine's murder was launched by detectives in the Serious Crime Review Team last year. A pollen expert has also been brought in to analyze the soil found in some of her clothing. Elaine vanished in April 1980 after leaving her office at Butlins holiday camp in Ayr, South Ayrshire. Her body was found 12 days later in a field at nearby Monkton. She had been strangled and her clothes were partially burned. Over the years, police have questioned more than 100 people about her death and major searches have been carried out in the Monkton and Prestwick areas. The fresh evidence has come to light during a cold case review into her murder which was launched by detectives in the Serious Crime Review Team last year. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: ""The inquiry team is committed to carrying out a thorough and robust review of Elaine's case and is working closely with forensic experts to ensure that all lines of inquiry are fully explored. ""We are continuing to make inquiries to identify the unknown male whose DNA was recovered from Elaine's body, and to establish the circumstances surrounding her death."" Elaine's family said they were ""delighted"" that her case was being reviewed. In a statement, they said: ""For the past 40 years our thoughts and prayers have been with Elaine day and night. We have never given up hope that one day the person or people responsible for taking her from us would be caught. ""We understand that as part of the inquiry they are trying to identify the DNA and that could take a little time. We are pleased that the police have taken this step and would ask that anyone with information comes forward and speaks to the police. ""We would also like to thank the police for their continued commitment to trying to catch Elaine's killer."" Anyone with any information about Elaine's death is being asked to contact the Serious Crime Review Team on 01786 406798 or email SCDReviewTeam@scotland.police.uk",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Joe Anderson: Liverpool mayor in police probe will not seek re-election,"Mr Anderson, 62, made the announcement after Merseyside Police said he had been rebailed until February following his arrest earlier this year. He said he would continue to serve as mayor until May, when his current term ends, but would not seek re-election in May's local elections. Mr Anderson was arrested in December on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. He was released on conditional bail in January and has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, Mr Anderson said: ""I have today decided that I will not be seeking re-election as Mayor of Liverpool in May. ""This decision has not been made lightly and has been taken after careful consideration of my personal circumstances and the current political landscape. ""I am proud of the work that I have done as Mayor of Liverpool over the last seven years. ""I have overseen a period of significant investment and regeneration in our city, and I have been a strong advocate for the people of Liverpool on a national and international stage.

Rain forecast as Glastonbury Festival opens,"Fans queued outside the Somerset site from dawn on Wednesday and counted down as the pedestrian gates were opened. They face a wet weekend, with heavy downpours predicted on Thursday and a potential mudbath on Friday. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the area, with up to 40mm of rain expected to fall within six hours on Thursday afternoon. Campers have described the site as ""a quagmire"" with many resorting to wearing wellington boots. Others battled through the thick mud in bare feet, leaving trails of brown footprints in their wake. The downpours have led to some road closures and disruptions, as well as delays to the festival shuttle buses. There are also concerns that the rain could lead to flooding, so festival-goers are being advised to take precautions. Despite the weather, spirits remain high and fans are determined to make the most of the festival. Queues for the main Pyramid Stage were already forming on Wednesday afternoon, as thousands eagerly awaited the first acts of the weekend. Headline acts this year include Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, and Paul McCartney, who will perform on Saturday night. There are also a host of other acts on the bill, including Sam Fender, Elbow, and Haim. For many, Glastonbury is more than just a music festival - it's a way of life. It's a chance to escape from the everyday and immerse yourself in a world of music, art, and culture. And while the rain may not be ideal, it's unlikely to dampen the spirits of the festival-goers. After all, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as bad weather, just inappropriate clothing.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tony Blair: Hard Irish border would be 'disaster',"The former UK PM said later he believed there was a ""common desire"" to make Northern Ireland a ""special case"" in Brexit negotiations. An open border had done a ""tremendous amount"" for UK and Irish trade and must be ""maintained"". ""I think one of the key things is to try to maintain a common travel area,"" Blair told the BBC, adding that a hard border would lead to smuggling and would ""damage the interests of both sides"". Blair's comments come as the UK and EU continue to negotiate the terms of the UK's exit from the bloc. The issue of the Irish border has been one of the most contentious issues in the talks, with both sides keen to avoid a hard border that could damage trade and lead to violence. The UK government has said it is committed to maintaining an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but has not yet set out how it will do so. The EU has said it is willing to consider a ""special arrangement"" for Northern Ireland, but has not yet agreed to any specific proposals. Blair's comments are likely to be welcomed by both the UK and Irish governments, who are keen to avoid a hard border. However, it remains to be seen whether the UK government will be able to come up with a solution that is acceptable to the EU. In a speech in Belfast in January, Blair said that the UK should ""stay as close as possible"" to the EU after Brexit. He said that the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union, and should continue to cooperate with the EU on issues such as security and foreign policy. Blair's comments were welcomed by some in the UK, but were criticized by others who said that he was out of touch with the public mood. The UK government has said that it will not remain in the single market or the customs union after Brexit, but has said it will seek a close relationship with the EU. It remains to be seen what kind of relationship the UK will have with the EU after Brexit. However, Blair's comments suggest that he believes that the UK should stay as close as possible to the EU, and that a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be avoided at all costs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Husband fears for her health,"Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April on spying charges, which she denies. Ratcliffe said he feared Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be forced to sign a false confession if her detention continued. ""She had quite a high-profile campaign and there's a lot of pressure to lay a charge against her,"" he told the BBC. ""My concern is, she's not very strong, she's been through a lot, and if they keep her... then she might just sign something that she doesn't really believe in."" Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention has been condemned by the British government, which has called for her immediate release. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said that he is ""deeply concerned"" about her welfare and has raised her case with his Iranian counterpart. The Iranian government has not commented on Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, but it has previously said that it does not recognize dual nationality. Ratcliffe said that he had been in contact with his wife's lawyer, who had told him that she was ""very weak"" and had lost a lot of weight. ""She's a very strong and determined person, but she's human, and I think she's now at her limits,"" he said. ""I'm very worried about her. I think she needs to come home."" Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a British-Iranian national who was born in Iran but has lived in the UK for many years. She is married to Richard Ratcliffe, a British citizen. The couple have a two-year-old daughter, Gabriella, who is being cared for by her grandparents in the UK. Ratcliffe said that he had been told by the Iranian authorities that Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be released on bail, but that this had not yet happened.

Kit Harington reveals family connection to the 'Gunpowder Plot',"Some think Guy Fawkes led the plot but it was actually Robert Catesby. Kit wanted to play his relative in the new BBC One drama Gunpowder which tells the story of the plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament on 5 November 1605. He said: ""I'm playing Robert Catesby - my great-great-great, great-great-great grandfather, 13 greats! ""He was a fascinating man. He was a committed Catholic who believed that the only way to restore the faith in England was through violence."" Catesby was a key figure in the plot, which was hatched in the wake of the persecution of Catholics by the Protestant government of King James I. Harington said he was drawn to the role because of the complex character of Catesby. ""He was a man of great faith and conviction, but he was also capable of great violence,"" he said. ""I think that's what makes him such a fascinating character to play."" Gunpowder also stars Liv Tyler as Anne Vaux, a Catholic supporter of the plot, and Mark Gatiss as Robert Cecil, the spymaster who foiled the plot. The three-part drama was written by Ronan Bennett and directed by J Blakeson. It is due to air on BBC One in the autumn. Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones. He has also starred in films such as Pompeii and Testament of Youth. Gunpowder is his first major TV role since Game of Thrones ended in 2019. In an interview with the Radio Times, Harington said he was excited to be working on a project that was so close to his heart. ""I'm really proud of this show,"" he said. ""It's a great story, and it's been told in a really exciting way.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Subsidy for non-existent flights costs Stormont £2.3m a year,"The deduction was part of the deal which allowed long-haul air passenger duty (APD) to be devolved in Northern Ireland. The decision was taken in 2013 when Stormont was sharing power with the UK government. EU rules state that subsidies for reduced air fares can only be made for flights to a specified destination, usually for economic reasons, such as establishing links to holiday destinations. The Department of Infrastructure told BBC News NI that there was a mechanism in place to claw back the money. ""A system is in place to reconcile the subsidy payments to airlines based on the actual number of passengers carried on the routes each year,"" the Department said. ""This ensures that if an airline does not meet the number of passengers projected the subsidy is reduced and repaid."" However, the subsidy is still paid in advance. The BBC understands that the funds for the current financial year were released last November, even though most of the flights linked to the subsidy have not yet taken off. The European Commission approved the subsidy on condition that the amount was gradually reduced over a period of time. The current payment of £2.3m is set to be reduced to £2.1m next year, and to £1.3m the following year. In 2020 the EU rules allowing the subsidy will expire. By that time, the total amount of money spent on the subsidy will be around £22m, of which around £15m will have been paid by Stormont. The majority of the flights supported by the subsidy are operated by United and Delta. They fly between Belfast City Airport and New York Newark, and Belfast International Airport to Orlando and New York JFK. The routes have been consistently used, with sometimes every seat sold. The argument from the airlines and DUP is that they are essential. They argue that the flights bring tourists to Northern Ireland, create jobs and allow people to travel to America for business or to visit family and friends. However, the subsidy has been criticised for being too expensive and for not being used to support new routes or services. Critics say there is a danger it is simply allowing the government to pay for existing flights that would happen anyway.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

However, this is still below the target of 95%. The Welsh government has said that it is ""deeply disappointed"" that the target has been missed again. ""We know that this is a difficult time for the NHS and we are working hard to improve performance,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have invested an extra £350m in the NHS this year and we are working with health boards to implement a number of measures to improve waiting times."" These measures include: Increasing the number of beds in hospitals Recruiting more staff Investing in new technology Improving the way that patients are discharged from hospital The Welsh government has also said that it is working with the UK government to improve the flow of patients through the NHS. The Welsh Conservatives have said that the Welsh government needs to do more to improve waiting times.

International GCSEs to be axed from school league tables,"The change is part of the government's overhaul of the exam system in England. New GCSEs in maths and English, which feature little or no coursework and are more challenging, will be introduced in September 2015. The government believes that the new exams will provide a better measure of pupils' achievement and will help to raise standards. However, some experts have expressed concerns that the axing of IGCSEs could lead to a narrowing of the curriculum and a reduced focus on international education. IGCSEs are currently offered in over 140 countries and are recognised by universities and employers around the world. They provide pupils with the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects, including languages, humanities and sciences, at a higher level than GCSEs. The decision to axe IGCSEs has also been criticised by some headteachers, who argue that they provide a valuable alternative to GCSEs. IGCSEs are often seen as being more rigorous than GCSEs, and they can help pupils to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in higher education and the workplace. The government has said that it will continue to support the teaching of international languages in schools, but it is not clear how this will be achieved without IGCSEs. IGCSEs are currently the only qualifications that are recognised by universities and employers as evidence of competence in a foreign language. The axing of IGCSEs is a significant change to the English education system. It is too early to say what the full impact of this change will be, but it is clear that it has the potential to have a major impact on the way that pupils are taught and assessed. In addition to the concerns raised above, there are also concerns that the axing of IGCSEs could lead to a decline in the number of pupils studying modern foreign languages. IGCSEs are currently the most popular qualifications in modern foreign languages, and they provide pupils with the opportunity to study a language in depth. Without IGCSEs, it is likely that the number of pupils studying modern foreign languages will decline, which would be a major loss for the country. The government has said that it is committed to ensuring that all pupils have access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background or ability. It is important that the government takes into account the concerns that have been raised about the axing of IGCSEs and ensures that all pupils continue to have the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects, including modern foreign languages.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Neo-Nazi group led by 13-year-old boy to be banned,"By Daniel De Simone BBC News Feuerkrieg Division, an international group that largely existed online, said earlier this year it had dissolved. But Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced plans to ban it under UK anti-terror laws. The group was led by a 13-year-old boy from the United States, who allegedly recruited children as young as 10 to carry out terrorist acts. Patel said the group posed a ""grave and credible threat to the security of the UK"" and that the ban would ""make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the group, to attend its meetings, or to support it in any way"". The ban is the first time a neo-Nazi group has been proscribed in the UK since 2016, when the far-right group National Action was outlawed. Feuerkrieg Division was founded in 2018 and quickly gained a presence on social media platforms such as Telegram and Discord. The group's members shared racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda, and encouraged their followers to carry out violence against minorities. In 2020, the group was linked to a number of plots to carry out terrorist attacks, including a plan to bomb a synagogue in the US. The group's leader, who has not been identified, was arrested in 2021 and charged with a number of offences, including conspiracy to commit murder. Patel said the ban on Feuerkrieg Division was a ""necessary step to protect the public from this dangerous group"". ""We will not tolerate hatred or violence in our society,"" she said. The ban on Feuerkrieg Division has been welcomed by anti-fascist groups, who say it is a positive step in the fight against extremism. However, some civil liberties groups have expressed concern about the ban, saying it could be used to target people who hold unpopular views. The ban is expected to come into force within the next few weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Self-employed bailout ‘problematic’,"By Faisal Islam Economics editor Rishi Sunak, however, repeatedly spelt out difficulties in applying the same terms as his recent bailout for companies. With that scheme, the Treasury agreed to pay 80% of wages for furloughed staff - those whose work has dried up because their employers cannot operate. But this relies on employers having a payroll through which wages are paid to begin with. The self-employed - by definition - do not have PAYE (pay as you earn) wages from a single employer through which the government can channel this cash. HMRC has estimated that about two million self-employed people are not eligible for Universal Credit, the main benefit for low-income families and people out of work. The Chancellor hinted at more assistance to these two million self-employed workers, but without giving details. He said: ""We are also considering what more we can do to help those who are not eligible for Universal Credit."" In a sign of frustration at the lack of clarity, the Liberal Democrats proposed an interim scheme for those self-employed workers left out. They want the government to give them a taxable grant equivalent to 80% of their average monthly income over the past three years, capped at £2,500 a month, backdated to March. The Treasury said: ""We recognise that the self-employed are facing significant challenges at the moment, and we are working on a package of measures to support them."" The chancellor also confirmed that the income tax self-assessment deadline would be deferred from 31 July to 31 January next year, but said this only applied to tax payments, not to filing the tax return itself. He said this would give people more time to complete and file their tax returns. In further support of businesses, the Treasury announced: Businesses with turnover less than £1 million will get a £10,000 grant Funding increased for the small business loan scheme from £350bn to £500bn Mr Sunak also said he would increase the generosity of the loan scheme by offering loans on a 100% guarantee, rather than 80%, from Tuesday. This would be backed up by the introduction, from next week, of a ""Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme"" offering loans of up to £25 million to businesses with an annual turnover of more than £45 million. The Bank of England also cut interest rates today from 0.75% to 0.1%, their lowest level since the Bank's inception 325 years ago, in order to stimulate the economy. The governor of the Bank, Andrew Bailey, said the ""coronavirus is the biggest economic shock that the UK has faced in living memory"". But the Treasury and Bank of England are now working together to ""do whatever it takes"" to protect businesses and jobs from the impact of the outbreak.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Windows 7 hardest hit by WannaCry worm,"More than 97% of the infections seen by Kaspersky Lab and 66% of those seen by BitSight used the older software. WannaCry affected Windows computers by exploiting a flaw in the way they handled Server Message Block (SMB) requests. Microsoft had released a patch for this flaw in March, but many computers had not installed it. The WannaCry worm spread rapidly across the world, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers. It demanded a ransom payment in Bitcoin, but it is not known how many people actually paid. The attack caused widespread disruption to businesses and organisations, including the NHS in the UK. Microsoft has since released a new patch for the SMB flaw, and it is urging users to install it as soon as possible. The company has also advised users to keep their software up to date, as this can help to protect them from future attacks. Here are some additional tips to help protect your computer from malware: Use a strong password and change it regularly. Keep your software up to date. Be careful about clicking on links in emails or on websites. Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date. Back up your data regularly. By following these tips, you can help to protect your computer from malware and keep your data safe. The WannaCry worm was a wake-up call for many businesses and organisations. It showed how important it is to keep software up to date and to have a strong cyber security strategy in place. By taking the necessary steps to protect their systems, businesses and organisations can help to prevent future attacks from causing widespread disruption. In the wake of the WannaCry attack, Microsoft has taken steps to improve the security of Windows 10. The company has released a new patch for the SMB flaw, and it has also introduced a new feature called Windows Defender Exploit Guard. This feature helps to protect computers from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in software. Businesses and organisations should also consider investing in cyber security software and services. These can help to protect their systems from a variety of threats, including malware, phishing attacks, and ransomware. By taking the necessary steps to protect their systems, businesses and organisations can help to keep their data safe and their operations running smoothly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Neil McEvoy: Commission reconsiders decision to recognise new party,"The Electoral Commission is reconsidering whether to officially register the Welsh National Party. It follows a threatened legal challenge by the current Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru. The move comes after the commission initially decided to recognise the new party, which was founded by former Plaid Cymru MP Neil McEvoy. However, Plaid Cymru has argued that the new party is too similar to its own and could cause confusion among voters. The Electoral Commission has now said that it will reconsider its decision in light of the legal threat. A spokesman for the commission said: ""We have received a letter from Plaid Cymru's lawyers setting out their concerns about the registration of the Welsh National Party. ""We are currently considering the legal arguments put forward and will make a decision on whether to reconsider our decision in due course."" The Welsh National Party was founded by McEvoy in 2021 after he left Plaid Cymru. McEvoy has said that he wants the new party to be a ""broad church"" for Welsh nationalists. However, Plaid Cymru has accused McEvoy of trying to ""steal"" its identity. The party's leader, Adam Price, has said that the Welsh National Party is ""a pale imitation"" of Plaid Cymru and that it will ""confuse voters"". The Electoral Commission's decision on whether to register the Welsh National Party is expected to be made in the coming weeks. If the commission decides to register the party, it will be able to field candidates in elections and receive public funding. However, if the commission decides not to register the party, it will not be able to do either of these things. The legal challenge from Plaid Cymru is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Welsh National Party. In 2022, the party was forced to change its name after the Electoral Commission ruled that its original name, ""Propel"", was too similar to that of another party. The party has also been criticized for its lack of transparency. In 2023, it was revealed that the party had failed to declare a donation of £25,000 from a property developer.

Soap bubble screen is 'the world's thinnest display',"An international team produced a display that uses ultrasonic sound waves to alter film's properties and create either a flat or a 3D image. The bubbles act as lenses that can focus and redirect light waves, enabling the creation of sharp images without the need for bulky and expensive hardware. The display is flexible and lightweight, making it suitable for various applications, including mobile devices, wearable displays, and medical imaging. The bubbles are created by vibrating a transducer that generates ultrasonic sound waves in a liquid solution. The sound waves cause the formation of a thin film of bubbles, which can be controlled by varying the frequency and intensity of the sound waves. The bubbles act as lenses that can focus and redirect light waves, enabling the creation of sharp images without the need for bulky and expensive hardware. The researchers believe that the soap bubble screen has the potential to revolutionise the display industry. It could lead to the development of thin, flexible, and portable displays that can be used in a wide range of applications. The technology could also be used to create 3D displays that provide a more immersive and realistic viewing experience. Dr Masaya Nishimura, from the University of Sussex, who led the research, said: ""This is a significant breakthrough in the field of display technology. We have developed a new type of display that uses soap bubbles as lenses to create images. This has the potential to lead to the development of thin, flexible, and portable displays that can be used in a wide range of applications.""

Oil firms 'need fresh strategies' says PwC report,"Oil firms 'need fresh strategies' says PwC report PwC said companies should be looking to deploy fresh strategies, following a sustained fall in the price of oil. It suggested they should look to reduce costs ""in a sustainable manner"" and find efficiencies by keeping tax costs as low as possible, whilst maintaining a focus on their workforce, technology and innovation. The consultancy's report on the oil and gas industry, entitled 'Navigating the crossroads: The strategic imperative for resilience', comes at a time when some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world have been cutting costs, and in some cases jobs. In its report PwC suggests that although the oil price may recover in the future, it is unlikely to reach the peaks seen in the past and companies need to adapt their business models accordingly. The report suggested firms should become ""more agile and responsive"" by moving away from ""rigid traditional structures"" and embracing digital technology. It also suggested a focus on technology and innovation in order to ""drive efficiency, reduce costs and gain competitive advantage"". The report's author, Jonathon Holgate, said: ""The oil and gas industry is at a crossroads. The traditional models of the past are no longer sustainable. Companies need to transform their business models to ensure their long-term competitiveness."" The report also suggests that companies should focus on their workforce, ensuring that they have the skills and capabilities to adapt to the changing business landscape. PwC argues that retaining and developing talent will be critical and this can be achieved through investment in training and development, and creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. PwC's report has been welcomed by some industry experts as a useful contribution to the debate on the future of the oil and gas industry. However, others have argued that the report does not go far enough and that the industry needs to take more radical action to adapt to the changing environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Dinas Dinlle beach erosion plan unveiled,"It is believed a flood defence built to protect Dinas Dinlle near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, from coastal flooding in 1994 has made the problem worse. Environment Agency Wales was outlining its plans for tackling the problem on Wednesday. The agency said: ""The main cause of erosion at Dinas Dinlle beach is the long-term loss of sediment from the beach and dunes. ""This is caused by a combination of factors, including the natural movement of sediment along the coast, changes in wave climate, and the presence of the flood defence structure. ""The flood defence structure was built in the early 1990s to protect the village of Dinas Dinlle from flooding. However, it has had the unintended consequence of exacerbating erosion to the beach."" The agency's preferred option is to build a new rock revetment along the length of the beach. This would be a sloping structure made of large rocks, which would absorb the energy of waves and protect the beach from further erosion. The agency said that the revetment would be ""sympathetic to the surrounding environment"" and would not have a significant impact on the visual amenity of the area. The agency is currently consulting on its plans and will be holding a public exhibition at Dinas Dinlle village hall on Thursday 12 July. Residents have welcomed the agency's plans. Clive Williams, who has lived in Dinas Dinlle for over 50 years, said: ""The erosion has been a real problem for the village. We've lost a lot of beach and the dunes are getting smaller. ""This new revetment will hopefully protect the village from flooding and stop the erosion getting any worse. It's good news for the village."" The agency said that it hopes to start work on the revetment in early 2020. The work is expected to take around six months to complete.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

London Underground: How does the Tube compare globally?,"By Nick Tarver BBC News Transport for London (TfL) has announced that every ticket office on the Tube is to shut by 2022. The move is part of a wider plan to modernize the network and make it more efficient. TfL says that ticket offices are no longer needed as the majority of passengers now use contactless payment or Oyster cards. The closure of ticket offices has been met with mixed reactions. Some passengers have welcomed the move, saying that it will make the network more streamlined and efficient. Others have expressed concern that it will make it more difficult for people to buy tickets, particularly those who are not familiar with using contactless payment or Oyster cards. TfL has said that it will provide additional support for passengers who need help buying tickets. This will include staff on hand at stations to help people use contactless payment or Oyster cards, and machines that will allow people to buy tickets using cash. The closure of ticket offices is just one of a number of changes that are being made to the Tube network. TfL is also investing in new trains, signaling systems, and stations. These changes are all part of a wider plan to improve the reliability, capacity, and frequency of services on the Tube. The Tube is one of the oldest and most iconic public transport systems in the world. It was first opened in 1863 and has since grown to become one of the busiest metro systems in the world. The Tube carries over 1 billion passengers every year and is an essential part of London's transport network. The Tube compares favorably to other metro systems around the world. It is generally clean, safe, and reliable. However, it is also one of the most expensive metro systems in the world. A single journey on the Tube can cost up to £5.60, which is more than the cost of a single journey on the New York City Subway or the Paris Métro. Despite its high cost, the Tube remains a popular and convenient way to travel around London. It is a fast, efficient, and reliable way to get from one place to another. The closure of ticket offices is unlikely to have a major impact on the Tube's popularity or convenience.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
European Commission predicts 'turning point' in Europe,"The Commission said there were ""signs of hope"" that had started to turn into ""tangible positive outcomes"". But in the eurozone - which uses the euro currency - growth is expected to be slower than in the EU as a whole. The Commission predicts that the eurozone will grow by 1.9% this year, and by 1.7% in 2024. This is slower than the EU's overall growth rate, which is expected to be 2.7% this year and 2.6% in 2024. The Commission said that the slower growth in the eurozone is due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine, high energy prices, and supply chain disruptions. The Commission also said that the EU's public finances are improving. The EU's budget deficit is expected to fall from 5.0% of GDP in 2022 to 3.9% of GDP in 2023, and to 3.6% of GDP in 2024. This is due to a number of factors, including the strong economic growth, and the EU's efforts to reduce its spending. The Commission said that the EU's debt-to-GDP ratio is also expected to fall, from 95.5% of GDP in 2022 to 91.8% of GDP in 2023, and to 89.6% of GDP in 2024. This is due to the EU's efforts to reduce its debt, and the strong economic growth. The Commission said that the EU's economy is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The Commission predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 2.8% in 2025, and by 2.9% in 2026. This is due to a number of factors, including the expected recovery in the eurozone, the strong global economy, and the EU's ongoing efforts to reform its economy. The Commission said that the EU's economy is facing a number of challenges, including the war in Ukraine, high energy prices, and supply chain disruptions. However, the Commission said that it is confident that the EU's economy will continue to grow in the coming years. The Commission said that the EU is ""well-placed to weather the current challenges and emerge stronger"".",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Second footballer comes forward over abuse at Crewe Alexandra,"Steve Walters - who was the club's youngest debutant in 1988 - has spoken to the Guardian newspaper. Ex-Crewe player Andy Woodward has also waived his anonymity to speak about the abuse he suffered at the club. Walters said he was abused by a coach when he was a teenager. He said the abuse took place over a period of two years and that he felt unable to speak out at the time. ""I was a young boy and I didn't know what to do,"" he said. ""I was scared and I didn't want to rock the boat."" Walters said he eventually told his parents about the abuse and they reported it to the police. However, he said the police did not take any action. ""I felt let down by the police,"" he said. ""I felt like they didn't believe me."" Walters said he is now speaking out to help other victims of abuse. He said he wants to show that they are not alone and that they can get help. ""I want to help other people who have been through the same thing,"" he said. ""I want them to know that they are not alone and that they can get help."" Crewe Alexandra has said it is ""deeply concerned"" by the allegations and that it is investigating them. The club said it is committed to providing a safe environment for all its players and that it will take any necessary action to protect them. ""We are deeply concerned by the allegations that have been made,"" a club spokesman said. ""We are investigating them and we will take any necessary action to protect our players."" The Football Association (FA) has also said it is investigating the allegations. The FA said it is committed to protecting children and that it will take any necessary action to ensure that they are safe. ""We are aware of the allegations that have been made and we are investigating them,"" an FA spokesman said. ""We are committed to protecting children and we will take any necessary action to ensure that they are safe.""

Saudi blogger Raif Badawi flogging postponed second time,"No reason has been given, but last week Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first round of 50 lashes. Mr Badawi's flogging was to have been carried out in public after Friday prayers outside a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, but witnesses said it did not take place. Saudi authorities have not commented on the postponement. Mr Badawi was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after being convicted of insulting Islam on his blog. His case has drawn widespread international condemnation, with human rights groups describing the punishment as ""cruel and inhuman"". The United Nations and the European Union have both called for Mr Badawi's release, and the United States has expressed ""deep concern"" about his case. Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, who lives in Canada with their three children, has welcomed the postponement of the flogging. However, she said she was still concerned about her husband's health. ""I am very worried about Raif's physical and mental health,"" she told the BBC. ""He has been through a lot in the last few weeks, and I don't know how much more he can take."" Mr Badawi's flogging has been condemned by a number of prominent figures, including the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond. Mr Hammond said the punishment was ""barbaric"" and ""an outrage"". The Saudi authorities have defended the sentence, saying it was in accordance with Islamic law. However, human rights groups argue that the punishment is cruel and inhuman, and that it violates international law. Mr Badawi's case has highlighted the issue of freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia. The country has a long history of suppressing dissent, and journalists, bloggers and activists are often arrested and imprisoned for expressing their views. In recent years, there have been some signs of progress on human rights in Saudi Arabia. In 2013, the country adopted a new law that criminalises torture. However, the law does not apply to flogging, and human rights groups say that torture is still widespread in Saudi prisons.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Pound falls as Theresa May indicates Brexit date,"It also hit its lowest level against the dollar since the beginning of July. On Sunday, the prime minister said she would trigger Article 50, the clause needed to start the process, by the end of March next year. The news prompted a flurry of activity in the foreign exchange market, with investors eager to protect themselves from any uncertainty that may arise during the Brexit negotiations. ""The pound has been under pressure for some time now, as investors have been worried about the impact of Brexit on the UK economy,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""The latest comments from Theresa May have only added to those concerns, and we could see further falls in the pound in the coming days and weeks."" The pound's decline has been particularly pronounced against the euro, which has gained around 10% against the pound since the UK voted to leave the EU. This is partly due to the fact that the eurozone economy is seen as being more stable than the UK economy, and partly because investors are betting that the UK will be forced to make concessions to the EU in order to secure a favourable Brexit deal. The pound's weakness is a concern for the UK government, as it could lead to higher inflation and make it more difficult for businesses to compete in the global market. The government has said that it is committed to maintaining the UK's economic stability, and it is likely to take steps to support the pound if it continues to fall. However, it is important to note that the pound's decline is not a one-way street. It is possible that the pound could recover some of its losses if the Brexit negotiations go smoothly and if the UK economy shows signs of improvement. Ultimately, the future of the pound will depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the broader economic outlook.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Ikea looks set to open more small stores in the UK,"UK boss Javier Quinones said the London shop was a ""learning experiment"" but its success meant the format was likely to expand to other UK cities. The concept allows people to order and design their furniture online before picking it up in-store, removing the need for large storage facilities. Instead, smaller stores have the space to display more products and offer workshops and other services. Quinones told the BBC: ""The store has been incredibly successful. It's proven itself as a very relevant concept. ""We have had incredibly positive reactions from customers and colleagues. It's really giving a better service, a more convenient service."" He added that the new format could be particularly useful in locations where space was at a premium, such as city centres. ""It means we can bring Ikea to even more people,"" he said. The move by Ikea follows a similar trend in the retail sector, with other big brands such as Amazon and John Lewis also opening smaller stores in recent years. These smaller stores are typically located in urban areas and offer a more curated selection of products, as well as services such as click-and-collect and online ordering. Analysts say that the smaller stores are helping to revitalise the retail sector by making it more convenient for customers to shop in person. The Ikea store in London's Hammersmith district opened in 2019 and has been a success ever since. It spans 10,000 sq ft, compared to the average 30,000 sq ft of a traditional Ikea store. In addition to the smaller footprint, the London store also has a different layout, with more products on display and fewer self-assembly options. Customers can order their furniture online before picking it up in-store, or they can use the store's planning service to design their own furniture. The store also offers a range of services, including workshops, cookery classes, and a restaurant. The success of the London store has led Ikea to consider opening more small stores in the UK. The company is currently looking at potential locations in other major cities, including Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Auschwitz victim Jane Haining's relatives attend reunion,"The recently discovered document offers fresh insight into the life of Jane Haining from Dunscore. In total some 14 of her relatives attended the event in Edinburgh. One of them, Catriona Routledge, said she thought it would be fascinating to learn more about her great-great-aunt, adding: ""I'm so glad we are able to do this at long last."" ""We remember her as Aunty Jane and we know she used to send wee parcels to her family back home,"" Catriona said. ""We did not know about the extent she cared for the children."" Another great-great-niece, Morag Pollard said: ""My grandfather and his brother, the sons of Jane Haining's sister, were brought up as if they were Jane's own children. ""They were looked after by the family while their mother died when they were young. ""They did not talk about it too much but what I did gather is that they were happy times."" Rev Iain MacDonald from Jane Haining's home church said she was ""an extraordinary woman. ""She was one in thousands of people who were caught up in circumstances that they did not have any control over,"" he said. ""For her to have the courage to go and help and then to stay when everyone was wanting her to go back makes her quite an extraordinary woman. ""She was a remarkable person."" The document states that Jane Haining came to the sanctuary to make a deliberate decision to stay. It shows that she was ""not prepared to leave the girls under any circumstances whatsoever."" Catriona Routledge said: ""We knew all along that she stayed to look after the children but we did not know that she made a conscious decision to do so. ""It might have been more courageous than we thought."" A memorial to Jane Haining was erected in Dunscore in 1995 and she is set to be honoured with a permanent display in the Museum of Edinburgh dedicated to her life. The current exhibition there has been visited by more than 50,000 people. A film has also been made to tell the story of Jane Haining.

Three-point turn may be dropped from UK driving test,"Under a revised practical exam, learners may also be asked to use a satellite navigation system instead of following road signs. About 1,000 learners will take part in a trial of the new test from June 2023, with the changes potentially being introduced by 2024. The current three-point turn manoeuvre may be scrapped, as sat navs become the norm and new cars fitted with reversing cameras and sensors. Other changes being considered include reversing into a parking bay and maneuvering at junctions, such as roundabouts. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said the changes are being considered to ensure the driving test ""remains relevant and up to date"". It comes after a review of the current test found that it does not ""sufficiently reflect the demands of modern driving"". The DVSA said the changes are not a ""watering down"" of the test, but rather a ""modernisation"" to reflect the way people drive today. The three-point turn has been a staple of the UK driving test for decades, but it is becoming increasingly less relevant as more and more drivers rely on sat navs. Sat navs can provide clear and concise directions, which can be helpful for drivers who are unfamiliar with an area. They can also help drivers to avoid getting lost, which can be a stressful experience. The DVSA said that the decision on whether or not to remove the three-point turn from the test will be made after the trial has been completed. The trial will assess the impact of the changes on the safety and competence of new drivers. It will also consider the views of learner drivers, driving instructors, and other stakeholders. The changes to the driving test are part of a wider effort to improve road safety in the UK. The government has set a target of reducing the number of road deaths and serious injuries by 40% by 2030. The DVSA said that the changes to the driving test will help to contribute to this target by ensuring that new drivers are better prepared for the challenges of modern driving.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Homeless mental health and drugs services 'broken' in Wales,"By Daniel Davies BBC Wales, Correspondent Funding is too low to cope with a ""rough sleeping crisis"" in Wales, according to a committee report which also cited a lack of leadership. Charities want ""radical action"", including extra money to deliver better drug and alcohol services. The Welsh government said it was committed to addressing homelessness. The Senedd's health committee found a ""lack of coherent and cohesive leadership"" in homelessness and mental health services. Urgent action needed, say homelessness charities Jenny Rathbone MS, chair of the health committee, said: ""Despite some good work by individuals and organisations, overall progress on tackling homelessness is too slow and inconsistent across Wales. ""In particular, we are concerned about the lack of co-ordination and leadership that exists at a local and regional level."" The committee found that statutory guidance and regulation was ""too weak"" and was not followed consistently. ""Consequently, a range of services are not operating to required standards,"" the report said. Its findings come at a time when homelessness in Wales is at a record high. Official figures show an 11% increase in the number sleeping rough in December 2022 compared to the same time in 2021. In 2023, 350 people were counted sleeping on the streets. The committee said that ""piecemeal"" work by councils and the voluntary sector ""cannot be a substitute for a co-ordinated, more consistent and transformative approach"". It has called on the Welsh government, local authorities, and health boards to ""collaborate to develop a 10-year strategy to end rough sleeping"". The report also said investment in addiction and mental health services was ""far too low"". ""We consider this to be wholly inadequate given the high levels of substance misuse and mental health problems among the homeless population,"" it added. Dr Patrick Kitley, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Wales, said: ""We need a radical approach to our drug and alcohol services. ""This must be embedded within broader homelessness services with a focus on recovery."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, said: ""The homelessness crisis and the lack of suitable provision of mental health and drug and alcohol services have gone on for far too long."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to addressing homelessness and providing support for those who need it most. ""The Tackling Homelessness Action Plan sets out our plan to deliver our commitment to end rough sleeping in Wales by 2030."" The spokesperson said it was ""committed to supporting people who are homeless for whatever reason"" and it provided more than £20m annually to local authorities to support them. ""We will continue to work collaboratively with health boards, the homelessness sector and others to deliver the right support for people who are homeless.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Police 'outnumbered' by Middlesbrough and Newcastle sledging crowds,"Large crowds congregated to frolic on Newcastle's Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough on Wednesday and Thursday. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings but the rules do not apply for spontaneous gatherings, which these events were deemed to be.  However, on Wednesday evening, a large crowd gathered on the Town Moor to celebrate the easing of lockdown. Police were called to disperse the crowd, which was estimated to be around 1,000 people. However, the size of the crowd meant that the police were outnumbered. The police were unable to disperse the crowd and they eventually left.  On Thursday evening, a similar crowd gathered on Flatts Lane Country Park. Again, the police were called to disperse the crowd, but they were again outnumbered. The police were able to disperse the crowd after a short time, but not before several people had been injured.  The police have said that they are disappointed with the behaviour of those who gathered on the Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park. They have said that they will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with such gatherings in the future.  The gatherings on the Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park are a reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. It is important to remember that social distancing measures are still in place and that we must all do our part to prevent the spread of the virus.  The police have said that they will be taking a more proactive approach to dealing with such gatherings in the future. They have said that they will be issuing fines to those who break the rules and that they will use their powers to disperse gatherings if necessary.  The police have urged the public to cooperate with them and to follow the rules.

MPs doubt supermarket scheme to spot carers,"By Rebecca Keating BBC News Sainsbury's has begun training staff to look for signs that customers may be caring for elderly or disabled people. They are told to give those doing two lots of shopping at once, or struggling to manage heavy bags, a little extra help. But some MPs fear the supermarket giant is only doing this to boost profits, by aiming to sell more products to carers. The retailer said its staff would be ""discreet and sensitive"" when approaching customers, and would only offer help if it was clear that it was needed. Customers would not be asked about their personal circumstances, Sainsbury's said. The move is part of a wider initiative by the supermarket to help vulnerable customers. Staff are also being trained to identify people who may be lonely or isolated. Sainsbury's said it had listened to feedback from carers and other groups, and had designed the scheme to be as non-intrusive as possible. However, some MPs have expressed concerns about the scheme. Labour's Barbara Keeley said she was worried that it could be used to target carers with marketing campaigns. ""I think it's a bit patronising and actually, it might be counter-productive,"" she said. ""If people feel like they're being targeted, they might be less likely to come forward and ask for help."" Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said she was ""a little bit sceptical"" about the scheme. ""I think it's great that Sainsbury's are trying to help vulnerable customers, but I just worry that this could be a way of them trying to sell more products,"" she said. Sainsbury's said it was ""committed to supporting carers"" and that the scheme was ""not about selling more products"". ""This is about helping people who are struggling to do their shopping,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're not going to be asking people about their personal circumstances. We're just going to be offering them a little bit of extra help if we think they need it."" The scheme is being piloted in 20 stores across the UK. If successful, it could be rolled out to all of Sainsbury's 600 stores.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Supreme Court to hear transgender school bathroom case,"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The district claims this is necessary to protect the privacy of cisgender girls, but the student argues it is discriminatory. The case is being closely watched as a potential landmark ruling on the rights of transgender people. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination, but it has not yet ruled on the specific issue of transgender bathroom access. A decision in favor of the school district could set a precedent for other schools to ban transgender students from using the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Conversely, a decision in favor of the student could provide greater protection for transgender students nationwide. The case is also being seen as a test of the Trump administration's stance on transgender rights. The administration has rolled back several Obama-era protections for transgender people, and it has signaled that it does not believe that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in March 2023. A decision is expected by the end of June. In addition to the legal issues involved, the case has also sparked a broader debate about the rights of transgender people. Some argue that transgender people should be able to use the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, while others believe that this could lead to safety concerns for cisgender people. The debate is likely to continue regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case. However, the Court's ruling will likely have a significant impact on the lives of transgender people across the United States.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Family of man shot dead by sheriff's deputy awarded $4 damages,"Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr was shot through his garage door on 14 January 2014 by the deputy in St Lucie County, Florida, while his hands were up. His family has now been awarded $4 in damages after an eight-year legal battle. The fatal shooting happened as Hill opened his garage door as the deputy was looking for someone else. The deputy claimed to have mistaken his phone for a gun. Body camera footage of the incident was released by the sheriff's office in 2017. It showed Hill opening his garage door and raising his hands in the air as the deputy fired four shots through it. Hill's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the sheriff's office in 2015. The case went to trial in 2019, but a federal jury found that the deputy did not use excessive force. The family appealed the verdict and in April 2022, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence. The court ordered a new trial on the issue of whether the deputy used excessive force. In November 2022, the family reached a settlement with the sheriff's office for $4. The settlement was approved by a federal judge on 10 January 2023. Hill's family said they were ""disappointed"" with the amount of damages they were awarded. ""We feel like our son's life was worth more than $4,"" Hill's mother, Beatrice Hill, said. ""But we're grateful that we were able to get some justice for him."" The sheriff's office said it was ""pleased"" that the case had been resolved. ""We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable,"" a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said. The settlement comes after a string of high-profile police killings of unarmed black men in the United States. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform. In response to the outcry, some police departments have begun to adopt new policies, such as requiring officers to wear body cameras and to de-escalate situations before using force. However, critics say that more needs to be done to address the issue of police brutality. They argue that the $4 settlement in Hill's case is a sign that the justice system is still failing black victims of police violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Concern over drivers using social media at the wheel,"Concern over drivers using social media at the wheel By Ben Mundy Newsbeat reporter The head of roads policing in England and Wales, Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, says people are increasingly posting updates, taking photos and video calling behind the wheel. She says this is a ""real concern"" as it can be just as dangerous as drink driving. ""We are seeing increasing numbers of people using social media while they're driving,"" she said. ""They're posting updates, taking photos, even video calling. It's a real concern because it's just as dangerous as drink driving."" Research by the RAC found that one in five drivers admitted to using social media while driving in the past year. The survey also found that drivers who used social media at the wheel were more likely to have been involved in a crash in the past five years. Chief Constable Davenport said: ""We need to do more to educate drivers about the dangers of using social media at the wheel. ""It's not just about the risk of crashing, it's also about the fact that it can distract you from other hazards on the road."" The RAC is calling for tougher penalties for drivers who use social media at the wheel. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""We believe that using social media at the wheel should be treated as seriously as drink driving. ""We want the government to introduce a specific offence for using social media while driving, with a minimum penalty of a £200 fine and six points on your licence."" Chief Constable Davenport said she supports the RAC's call for tougher penalties. ""We need to send a clear message that using social media at the wheel is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We will continue to work with our partners to educate drivers about the dangers of this behaviour and we will also be taking enforcement action against those who break the law.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
West Coast Main Line bid probe 'must be external',"The decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup was scrapped over ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government has since announced a review of what went wrong, but Labour says this should not be carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT). Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said an external probe was needed to restore trust in the process. ""The botched West Coast Main Line competition has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermined trust in the government's ability to run a fair and transparent bidding process,"" he said. ""An internal DfT review into what went wrong simply won't cut it. The public needs to know that the government is taking this seriously and that lessons will be learned to prevent the same mistakes happening again. ""The only way to achieve this is through an independent external review."" The DfT has said it will ""carefully consider"" Labour's request. A spokesman said: ""We are conducting a thorough review of the West Coast Main Line bidding process to understand what went wrong and learn lessons for the future. ""We will carefully consider Labour's request for an external review and respond in due course."" The West Coast Main Line is one of the busiest railway lines in the UK, running from London Euston to Glasgow Central. The franchise to operate the line was awarded to FirstGroup in August 2022, but the decision was scrapped in October 2022 after the DfT found ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government has since announced a review of the process, which is being led by former civil servant Keith Williams.

"Children need more exercise - especially girls, study says","By Nick Triggle Health correspondent, BBC News University College London researchers found just 51% of the 6,500 children they monitored achieved the recommended hour of physical activity each day. For girls, the figure was just 38%, compared with 63%. They say girls are more reluctant to take part in activities that will make them sweaty, messy or put them at risk of injury. And for both boys and girls, after-school clubs and family outings play a key role in ""topping up"" children's activity levels. The research, published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal, is the largest of its kind, and tracks activity in 11-12 year olds from 12 countries, including the UK, US, Belgium and Australia. The World Health Organization recommends children aged five to 17 years should do at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day, to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. But the study found that around half (49%) of children across the globe were falling short. ""The good news is that across all of the countries, over 80% of children were managing at least some physical activity,"" said Prof Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study. ""But the bad news is that it's not enough."" The study used accelerometers - worn on the wrist like a watch - to measure children's activity. ""What we found was, girls were much less active than boys. On average, they did 25 minutes less activity per day,"" said Prof Viner. ""There are a number of factors at play - girls are more likely to spend time at home, playing video games or watching TV, and they are more concerned about getting messy or sweaty."" ""And doing strenuous activities can be painful for girls, because they may be beginning to develop breasts."" The study also found that activity levels varied widely between countries - with children in Australia and New Zealand the most active and those in Colombia, Brazil and South Africa the least active. One of the reasons for this was the time spent on ""active travel"". ""Children in New Zealand and Australia were much more likely to walk or cycle to school,"" said Prof Viner. ""And going to school and walking home provide kids with an easy way to top up their daily activity level."" The study also found that watching TV and playing video games can reduce activity levels by the equivalent of one to two hours per day. ""But while screen time is important, what really concerns us is the children who are not doing any structured activity,"" said Prof Viner. ""It's really important that we find ways to increase physical activity in children. And that means encouraging them to take part in activities that they enjoy, and making sure there are safe places for them to play.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Italy coalition: Thousands rally in Rome against cuts,"Wielding red flags and placards, they urged the centre-left Prime Minister, Enrico Letta, to scrap austerity measures and focus on job creation. Public trust in his fragile coalition with the centre-right is dropping, opinion polls suggest. ""We're here today to tell the government to stop killing us,"" said one protester, Livia Albertini, a retired teacher. ""We want them to stop cutting education, health and public services. We want them to start investing in jobs and the future."" The protest was called by the largest Italian trade union, the CGIL, as well as several leftist parties and social movements. They say that the government's austerity measures are hitting the poor and working class the hardest, while the rich and powerful continue to get richer. ""This government is making the rich richer and the poor poorer,"" said Susanna Camusso, the leader of the CGIL. ""We cannot accept this anymore. We need a change of course."" The government has defended its austerity measures, saying they are necessary to reduce Italy's high debt and deficit. But critics say the measures are too harsh and are causing unnecessary hardship. ""These cuts are killing people,"" said Antonio Lai, a disabled protester. ""I'm here to fight for my rights and the rights of all disabled people. We cannot afford to lose any more."" The protest comes at a time of growing public discontent in Italy. The government's popularity has plummeted in recent months, and there is increasing speculation that it could collapse. A recent opinion poll found that only 29% of Italians approve of the government's performance. Dissatisfaction with the government is particularly high among young people, who are struggling to find jobs and afford housing. The government is facing a difficult balancing act. It needs to reduce the deficit while also addressing the needs of the population. If it fails to do so, it could face a wave of protests and instability.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Betsi health board chief criticises 'misleading' Tawel Fan claims,"It made major criticisms but found no evidence of institutional abuse at the now-closed Tawel Fan ward for dementia patients at Glan Clwyd Hospital. Some politicians and some families had claimed that abuse on the ward was widespread and systematic. The independent inquiry into the ward was ordered by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in 2020. It was chaired by former High Court judge Wyn Williams QC. Its report found there was no evidence to back up the claims of abuse, but it did find there were many problems on the ward, which has now been closed. In a hard-hitting report, it concluded that the board's governance arrangements ""required significant improvement"". It also said the board had failed to respond adequately to concerns and complaints about the ward. In response to the report, a spokesman for the health board said it had accepted ""all the findings and recommendations in the report and is already taking action to address each one"". The report made 24 recommendations to the health board, including: Improve its governance arrangements Respond more effectively to concerns and complaints Improve safeguarding arrangements Improve staffing levels and training Establish an independent body to provide assurance that improvements are being made. In a statement, the Welsh government said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the findings of the report. It said it was working with the health board to ensure that the recommendations were implemented. The report comes after a series of allegations of abuse at the ward. In 2019, a BBC Wales investigation revealed that a number of patients had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. The health board initially denied the allegations, but later apologized and launched an internal investigation. The independent inquiry was commissioned to investigate the allegations in more detail. It heard evidence from a number of witnesses, including patients, their families, and staff. The report concluded that there was no evidence to support the claims of institutional abuse. However, it did find that there were a number of problems on the ward, including: Understaffing Poor communication Lack of training A culture of fear The report also found that the health board had failed to respond adequately to concerns and complaints about the ward. It said the board had a ""defensive and dismissive approach"" to concerns raised by families and staff. In response to the report, the health board has said it has accepted all the findings and recommendations. It has also apologized to the families of patients who suffered poor care on the ward. The report is a damning indictment of the health board. It shows that the board failed to protect some of the most vulnerable people in its care. The board must now take action to implement the recommendations of the report and ensure that such abuses can never happen again.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
TEDGlobal: Burns portrait comes alive at TED,"By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter, TEDGlobal, Edinburgh The demonstration was part of a session at the TEDGlobal (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference dedicated to makers and DIY-ers. With a nod to the talking portraits at Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the portrait of Robert Burns started to move and speak after Farrow put on a pair of special glasses. Farrow, who describes himself as a ""digital artist and necromancer"" - someone who brings the dead back to life with technology - said that using his glasses, the portrait ""becomes a window into some parallel universe"". ""I'm using a camera to film my video and then I'm projecting it back on to the painting,"" he explained. ""It's all real time. There are no pre-recorded videos. Instead, my software is analysing the video of my face and neck and then mapping that on to the painting. ""This technology has been around for years in films and the video game industry but I wanted to see if it could be used in a different way. ""This is the first time that I've used it with a portrait. I'm really interested in the use of artificial intelligence. Can we use computers to bring dead people back to life? Can I upload my brain to the cloud? ""If I could, I would want to be like Tupac. I would want to be a rapping ghost."" Farrow's work may seem like a gimmick, but he said that it could have a serious use in the future. ""I can see this technology being used for historical figures,"" he said. ""Imagine a museum where you can put on a pair of glasses and see Churchill making a speech. Or you could watch Neil Armstrong walking on the moon."" ""I think it's a really exciting and powerful way to connect with the past."" The audience at TEDGlobal seemed impressed with Farrow's work. Afterwards, many people queued up to put on the glasses and see the portrait of Burns for themselves. One person said that it was ""like magic"". Farrow's work is a reminder that technology is constantly evolving and that we are only just beginning to explore its possibilities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe,"Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, he was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the pair had a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to ""deepen the European Union"". Mr Macron's speech was titled ""For a Democratic and Sovereign Europe"", and he laid out his plans for a ""rebirth of Europe"" based on three key principles: a sovereign, united Europe; a more democratic Europe; and a Europe that is ""open to the world"". On the first point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to become more independent and less reliant on others. He called for a ""European defence force"" to protect the continent from external threats, and for a ""European energy union"" to reduce dependence on Russian gas. On the second point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to become more democratic and accountable to its citizens. He called for a ""European citizens' initiative"" to give people a greater say in EU decision-making, and for a ""European Parliament that is truly representative of the people"". On the third point, Mr Macron said that Europe needed to be more open to the world. He called for a ""European trade policy that is fair and ambitious"", and for a ""European immigration policy that is humane and effective"". Mr Macron's speech was well-received by the German audience, and it was seen as a sign that he is serious about reforming the EU. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to convince other EU leaders to follow his lead. Ms Merkel, who has been a close ally of Mr Macron, said that she shared his ""vision for Europe"". She said that the EU was ""at a crossroads"" and that it was time to ""take bold steps"" to reform it. The speech comes at a time when the EU is facing a number of challenges, including the rise of populism, the threat of terrorism, and the ongoing migration crisis. Mr Macron's speech was seen as an attempt to provide a positive vision for the future of Europe and to reassure people that the EU can meet these challenges. However, it remains to be seen whether Mr Macron will be able to convince other EU leaders to follow his lead. The EU is a complex institution, and it is difficult to get all 28 member states to agree on anything.

China 'to survey disputed East China Sea islands',"State news agency Xinhua said the survey was part of China's ""programme to safeguard its maritime rights and interests"". The islands are controlled by Japan, which refers to them as the Senkakus, but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyus. The move comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over the islands, which are located in an area believed to be rich in natural resources. Beijing's announcement on Tuesday (19 July) confirmed the survey had started near the disputed islands the previous day. Japan has lodged a formal protest with China, saying the survey was ""unacceptable"" and a violation of its territorial waters. Tokyo said it had dispatched patrol ships and aircraft to the area to monitor the Chinese activity. China's foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said the survey was a ""routine"" operation, carried out in waters under China's jurisdiction. He urged Japan to ""immediately stop its illegal activities"", and respect China's sovereignty. The Diaoyu/Senkaku islands are a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, about 200km (124 miles) north-east of Taiwan. They have been under Japanese control since 1895, but China claims they were first discovered by Chinese sailors in the 14th Century. The dispute over the islands has escalated in recent years, with both countries sending ships and aircraft to patrol the area. The islands are thought to be surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially valuable oil and gas reserves. The survey by China is likely to further increase tensions between the two countries, which are also at odds over a number of other issues, including their respective claims to parts of the South China Sea. The United States has urged both China and Japan to resolve their dispute peacefully, and has said it would not take sides in the matter. The US has also said that it has no view on the ultimate sovereignty of the islands, and that it expects both sides to avoid actions that could escalate tensions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
First peek at Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play,"By Amelia Butterly Newsbeat reporter Published on Pottermore, JK Rowling's Harry Potter website, the images show a young boy in a nest. The photos also show an older boy, said to be an adult Harry Potter, talking to a bearded man thought to be Ron Weasley. The photographs have fuelled speculation that the play, which is set 19 years after the end of the Harry Potter series, will focus on one of Harry's children. But the latest information released on the play's official website suggests Harry and Ron will have a more prominent role in the production. The full synopsis reads: ""While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. ""As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places."" The synopsis indicates that not everything is plain sailing for Harry and his family in later life. Fans will get a chance to find out what Harry has been up to since the Battle of Hogwarts when the play opens at the Palace Theatre in London's West End on 30 July 2016. While little has been revealed about the plot of the play, speculation is already rife among Potter fans. Some fans have suggested that Albus, Harry's youngest son, will struggle to live up to his family name. Others have speculated that the play will explore the relationship between Harry and his rival Draco Malfoy, whose son Scorpius will also be attending Hogwarts. Whatever the plot, the play is sure to be a major event in the Harry Potter calendar. Tickets for the play went on sale in October 2015 and sold out within hours.

'Scrap ban' on term-time holidays,"By Hannah Richardson BBC News education reporter Since September last year, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take children out of school for unauthorised absences. But the Local Government Association says the ""zero-tolerance"" approach for term-time holidays has resulted in ""huge"" variations in fines across the country. And campaigners argue that the rules are unfair, disproportionately affecting poorer families. In theory, local authorities are supposed to issue a fixed penalty notice (FPN) of £60, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 28 days, and possibly a fine of up to £1,000 for non-payment. However, a BBC investigation has found some are not issuing any fines, while others issue penalties of up to £2,500 in some cases. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was ""disappointing"" that ""very small number of parents continue to take their children out of school without authorisation - and that there is a ""small but significant variation in enforcement."" Here are some key points: Fining parents for taking their children out of school during term time is a hot topic at the moment, with strong opinions on both sides of the debate. The government introduced a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to term-time holidays in September 2013, and since then, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take their children out of school for unauthorised absences. However, there is a huge variation in fines across the country, with some councils issuing no fines at all and others issuing fines of up to £2,500. The Local Government Association says this is because the government has not provided clear guidance on how to enforce the new rules. Campaigners argue that the new rules are unfair, disproportionately affecting poorer families. The government says it is ""disappointing"" that a very small number of parents continue to take their children out of school without authorisation, and that there is a small but significant variation in enforcement. Only 10 councils out of 128 in England issued more than 1,000 fines for absence last year, according to the LGA. A handful, including Hartlepool and Bristol, issued no fines at all. The LGA, which represents more than 370 local councils, said there was ""confusion and inconsistency"" about how the rules should be enforced. ""It's unworkable and unfair on families,"" he said. ""The system needs urgent reform.""

The pair were searching a field near Hearsall Common, close to the Hearsall Hangar community centre in Coventry, when they found the platinum band. It had the name ""Jan"" engraved inside, as well as the date the couple married in 1977. ""I could tell it was a wedding ring, it's quite a distinctive pattern,"" Mr Moore said.

VW US sales rise despite scandal,"On Monday US regulators said an extra 800,000 cars had been identified as using devices that concealed emission levels during testing. The carmaker sold 30,387 cars in October, a rise of 6.6% on the same period last year. It was the third month in a row that sales have increased. The company's US chief executive Hinrich Woebcken said October's results were ""encouraging"". However, the firm still faces a number of challenges, including a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice and a class action lawsuit filed by owners of affected vehicles. Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with software, known as a ""defeat device"", that allowed them to cheat on emissions tests. The scandal has cost the company billions of dollars in fines and compensation, and has led to the resignation of its chief executive Martin Winterkorn. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ordered Volkswagen to recall nearly 500,000 vehicles. The company has also agreed to pay a $4.3bn (£2.8bn) fine for violating environmental regulations. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen's US sales have remained relatively strong. The company has been offering incentives to customers, such as zero-percent financing and cash rebates. It has also been promoting its new models, such as the redesigned Tiguan SUV and the all-electric e-Golf. Volkswagen's US sales chief Mark McNabb said that the company was ""pleased"" with October's results. However, he acknowledged that the company still faces a ""number of challenges"".

"Women still do more household chores than men, ONS finds","The Office for National Statistics said that, when it came to unpaid chores at home, women were doing almost 40% more than men on average. Men averaged 16 hours a week on unpaid work in the home, compared with women's 22 hours. The ONS data showed a small improvement on the previous year, when the gap was 41%. However, the data also showed that the share of unpaid work done by women had not changed significantly since the early 1990s. The figures come from the ONS's annual Time Use Survey, which asks people about how they spend their time. The survey found that women were more likely to do unpaid chores such as: Cleaning Cooking Laundry Childcare Caring for elderly or disabled relatives Men were more likely to do unpaid chores such as: DIY Gardening Car maintenance The ONS said that the gender gap in unpaid work was ""partly due to the fact that women are more likely to work part-time or have caring responsibilities"". However, the ONS also said that ""gender stereotypes and expectations"" may play a role. The ONS data also showed that the gender gap in unpaid work was wider among younger people. Women aged 25-34 did an average of 25 hours of unpaid work a week, compared with 17 hours for men of the same age. The gender gap in unpaid work has been declining in recent decades, but progress has been slow. The ONS said that ""more needs to be done to address the gender gap in unpaid work"". The ONS data also showed that the amount of time people spend on paid and unpaid work has increased in recent decades. In 1995, people spent an average of 37 hours a week on paid and unpaid work. By 2015, this had increased to 42 hours a week. The ONS said that the increase in working hours was partly due to the fact that more women are now in the workforce. However, the ONS also said that ""the increasing demands of work and family life"" may be playing a role.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Ex-soldier self-isolating on 'uninhabited' Hildasay,"Chris Lewis has walked 12,000 miles after setting off from near his home in Swansea in August 2017. He has now been self-isolating on the remote Scottish island of Hildasay since March 23. The island, which is located in the North Atlantic, is home to only one other person, a farmer who lives on the neighboring island of Sanday. Lewis, a former soldier, decided to self-isolate on Hildasay after the UK government imposed a lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said he wanted to ""get away from the crowds"" and ""minimize the risk"" of contracting the virus. ""I'm not afraid of the virus,"" Lewis told the BBC. ""I'm just being sensible. I don't want to put anyone else at risk."" Lewis has been living in a bothy, a small stone hut, on Hildasay. He has been foraging for food and fishing for mackerel. He has also been keeping a blog about his experience. ""I'm really enjoying it,"" Lewis said. ""It's a beautiful island and I'm getting plenty of exercise. I'm also learning a lot about survival skills."" Lewis is not the only person who has chosen to self-isolate on a remote island during the pandemic. In April, a group of six people from the UK sailed to the uninhabited island of Gigha in the Inner Hebrides. The group, which included a doctor, a nurse, and a teacher, said they wanted to ""create a safe haven"" away from the virus. ""We're not trying to escape reality,"" one of the group members told the BBC. ""We just want to live a more sustainable and self-sufficient life."" The decision to self-isolate on a remote island is not without its risks. The islands are often exposed to harsh weather conditions and there is limited access to medical care. However, for some people, the benefits of escaping the crowds and living a simpler life outweigh the risks. ""I'm not sure how long I'll stay on Hildasay,"" Lewis said. ""But I'm in no rush to leave. I'm enjoying the peace and quiet and I'm learning a lot about myself.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Putin's Stasi spy ID pass found in Germany,"The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass, a document that allowed him to access restricted areas in East Germany, was recently discovered in the archives of the German secret service. The pass, which bears Putin's photo and signature, was issued in 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is a reminder of Putin's close ties to the former East German regime, which was one of the Soviet Union's closest allies. Putin has never denied his past as a KGB officer, and he has often spoken fondly of his time in Dresden. In a 2014 interview, he said that he ""learned a lot"" from his experience in East Germany, and that it helped him to ""understand the world."" However, some critics have accused Putin of glorifying the Soviet Union and its repressive regime. They argue that his nostalgia for the past is a sign that he is not committed to democratic values. The discovery of Putin's Stasi pass is likely to fuel further debate about his past. It is a reminder of his close ties to the former East German regime, and it raises questions about his commitment to democratic values. In addition to the pass, the German secret service also discovered a number of other documents related to Putin's time in Dresden. These documents include reports on his activities, as well as assessments of his character. The documents provide a glimpse into Putin's life as a young KGB officer. They show that he was a ambitious and dedicated agent, who was highly valued by his superiors. The documents also reveal that Putin was involved in a number of controversial activities while in Dresden. These activities include the surveillance of dissidents and the suppression of political dissent. The discovery of Putin's Stasi pass and the related documents is a significant event. It provides new information about his past, and it raises important questions about his commitment to democratic values.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Trump tariffs: President says EU makes business 'impossible',"Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had ""taken advantage of"" the US for many years. He said the EU was ""very difficult to deal with"" and made it ""impossible"" for US businesses to make money. ""We can't have that, we're not going to have that,"" he said. The EU has said it will retaliate against the US tariffs, which it believes violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The US has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, and is threatening to impose tariffs on cars and other products. The EU has said it will impose tariffs on a range of US products, including motorcycles, bourbon and jeans. The trade dispute is the latest in a series of tensions between the US and the EU. The two sides have also been at odds over Iran, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The US has also imposed tariffs on China, and is threatening to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods, and the two sides are currently engaged in trade talks. The trade disputes are having a negative impact on the global economy, and are raising fears of a trade war. The WTO has warned that the trade disputes could lead to a global recession. The US and the EU are the world's two largest economies, and a trade war between the two would have a significant impact on the global economy. The trade disputes are also raising tensions between the US and its allies. The EU and China are both allies of the US, and the trade disputes are putting a strain on those relationships. The US is also at odds with Canada and Mexico over trade, and is threatening to impose tariffs on imports from those countries. The trade disputes are a major challenge for the Trump administration, and it is unclear how they will be resolved. The Trump administration has said that it is willing to negotiate with other countries, but it is also prepared to impose tariffs if necessary.

Sir Terry Matthews: Wales lacks IT commerce skills,"The industrialist, who made his fortune in hi-tech firms, is to address a conference in Newport on how businesses can use IT to boost profits. He said: ""We don't lack people who can write an algorithm, or design a software programme, or get a computer system up and running. What we lack, and this is across all industries, is people who really understand how to transform businesses by using IT."" Sir Terry believes the Welsh government is taking important steps to improve the situation, but more is needed from industry itself. ""The Welsh government has a role, through schools and training, to make sure people get the basic skills they need,"" he said. ""But really, we need more people to become IT-savvy middle managers. Businesses need to create more jobs specifically in this area."" He said companies need to move away from the ""traditional mindset"" of seeing IT as a ""geeky backroom function"". He said: ""It's not that. IT is a powerful tool that can help businesses reach new customers, increase efficiency, improve productivity, and make better decisions."" Sir Terry said the conference will hear practical advice from business leaders who have successfully used IT to boost their profits, including examples from industries as diverse as manufacturing, tourism and retail. ""I hope a lot of business people from all over Wales will come along,"" he said. ""The conference will leave them in no doubt that IT can be a big help to businesses of all sizes."" The conference, called ""IT for Business Growth"", will be held at the Newport Hilton on 10 May. Further information can be found at www.itforbusinessgrowth.com.

Rory Cowan: 'Unhappy' Mrs Brown's Boys actor quits,"Cowan said he had been ""unhappy"", and left his co-stars after a Mrs Brown show at London's O2 Arena on Sunday. He has worked with the comedy's creator Brendan O'Carroll for 26 years. ""It was a hard decision to leave after 26 years,"" Cowan told PA Media. ""It was a great job but I'm not happy doing it anymore."" Cowan played Rory Brown in the sitcom, which has been a huge hit for the BBC since it began in 2011. The show has won numerous awards, including two BAFTAs. However, Cowan said he had become increasingly unhappy with the show in recent years. ""I've been unhappy for a long time,"" he said. ""I've been talking to Brendan about it for the last few years. I've been trying to work it out, but I couldn't do it anymore."" Cowan said he did not want to go into detail about his reasons for leaving, but he said it was not because of any disagreement with O'Carroll. ""I've had a great time working with Brendan,"" he said. ""He's a great guy and I wish him all the best."" O'Carroll said he was ""very sad"" to see Cowan leave the show. ""Rory is a great actor and a great friend,"" he said. ""I wish him all the best in the future."" Cowan's departure is the latest in a series of changes for Mrs Brown's Boys. In 2020, Brendan O'Carroll's wife Jenny Gibney left the show after 20 years. However, O'Carroll has said that the show will continue despite the departures. ""The show will go on,"" he said. ""We've got a great cast and crew and we're still getting great ratings."" Mrs Brown's Boys has been criticized for its perceived homophobia and transphobia. In 2020, the show was accused of using homophobic slurs in an episode. However, O'Carroll has defended the show, saying that it is not intended to be offensive. ""I'm not a homophobe,"" he said. ""I'm not a transphobe.

John Boehner survives House rebellion in US Congress,"Mr Boehner survived a challenge from the party's more conservative wing, with 25 Republicans voting against him. At the top of the Republican agenda is approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial project that would carry oil from Canada to the US Gulf Coast. The pipeline is opposed by environmentalists, who argue that it would increase carbon emissions and contribute to climate change. However, Republicans argue that the pipeline would create jobs and boost the economy. Boehner's victory is a sign that he has been able to maintain the support of the majority of his caucus, despite the challenge from the more conservative wing of the party. However, the vote also shows that there is significant opposition to his leadership within the Republican Party. This opposition could make it difficult for Boehner to pass legislation in the future, especially if he needs the support of conservative Republicans. The vote on the Keystone XL pipeline is likely to be a major test for Boehner's leadership. If he is unable to pass the bill, it will be a sign that he is losing the support of his caucus. However, if he is able to pass the bill, it will be a major victory for him and for the Republican Party. The Keystone XL pipeline is a major infrastructure project that would have a significant impact on the US economy and environment. The pipeline would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States, and it is estimated to create thousands of jobs and add billions of dollars to the US economy. However, the pipeline is also opposed by environmentalists, who argue that it would increase carbon emissions and contribute to climate change.

Mayor hopes Treasury will hop on board travel plans,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter Today the mayor is in Northern Ireland showing off the new chassis production line for the 'New Bus for London', a modern design based on the old Routemaster which has been built at Wrightbus in Ballymena for 70 years. It will be a hybrid diesel-electric double-decker with more wheelchair spaces and USB charging points and, crucially, the ability to convert to 100% electric when the technology allows. At the same time, Transport for London (TfL) has begun its own consultation on proposals for a new bus franchising system in the capital. Under the plans, all buses would be run by a small number of companies under contract to TfL, rather than the current system where each operator is responsible for its own routes. The mayor hopes the Treasury will hop on board his travel plans by providing funding for a pilot scheme and, crucially, for the conversion to electric buses. The government's Integrated Rail Plan for the north of England, published last week, has been criticised for ignoring Leeds and Bradford and the potential to develop the Northern Powerhouse. There is a glimmer of hope for West Yorkshire, however, with the promise of £200m towards a new mass transit system that will link Leeds Bradford Airport with the city centres of Leeds and Bradford. In his speech, the mayor will also unveil plans for a new walking and cycling superhighway between Barking Riverside in east London and the City of London. The 12-mile route, which will be open 24 hours a day, will be mostly segregated from traffic and is intended to make it easier and safer for people to travel between east and central London. The mayor is also expected to announce a new push to make London the most cycle-friendly city in the world. The plans include a new 'Cycle Superhub' at Waterloo station, which will provide secure parking for 10,000 bikes, and a new 'Cycleway to Heaven' that will link the North Circular with Alexandra Palace. The mayor's plans are ambitious, but they are also essential if London is to meet its goals of reducing air pollution and congestion. With the government's support, he can make London a more sustainable and livable city for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, 'not caused by the XMRV virus', say researchers","By Helen Briggs Health reporter, BBC News US scientists linked the condition, also known as ME, to a mouse-like virus in 2009 after finding it in a few patients. The finding raised hopes that a cause had been found and even that a cure might be on the horizon. But subsequent research has cast doubt on this idea, with other scientists failing to find the virus in ME patients. Now a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences provides the strongest evidence yet that the virus is not a cause of ME. The study tested nearly 1,000 people - about half with ME, and half healthy - for the presence of XMRV. They found that, out of about 500 people with ME, 6.7% had antibodies to the virus. But, out of about 500 healthy controls, 6.5% also had antibodies to the virus. This suggests that the presence of the virus is not what distinguishes people with ME from healthy people. The researchers also looked for the actual virus in the blood of people with ME and in healthy controls, again finding no difference between the groups. They also looked for signs of an active viral infection in people with ME and did not find any. This all adds to the growing body of evidence that XMRV is not a cause of ME. At the very least, the virus is not necessary for the development of ME, and it is unlikely to be sufficient to cause the condition. The researchers say that this does not mean that a virus is not involved in ME. It could be that another virus, so far undetected, is the cause. Or it could be that a virus is a trigger for ME in some people, but that other factors are also required. The researchers say that more research is needed to find the cause of ME. In the meantime, they say that people with ME should not be discouraged by the latest findings. There is still hope that a cause will be found and that a cure will be developed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Netflix removes Dave Chappelle's show after comedian's complaint,"Chappelle's Show first aired on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2006. But in an excerpt from a recent stand-up gig that he posted on Instagram, he claimed he ""never got paid"" royalties. ""They didn't have to pay me because I signed a contract,"" he says in the clip. ""But is that right? I found out that these people were streaming my work, and they never paid me a dime..."" Netflix confirmed to the BBC that it had removed the show from its platform. ""We licensed Chappelle's Show from ViacomCBS, and we're removing the show from Netflix until we can resolve the licensing issues,"" a spokesperson said. ViacomCBS, which owns Comedy Central, said in a statement that it ""has been actively working with Netflix to resolve this issue"". The move has sparked a debate about the rights of artists and performers, particularly in the streaming era. Some have argued that Chappelle is right to demand payment for his work, while others have questioned whether he has the legal right to do so. In a statement posted on his website, Chappelle said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by Netflix's decision to remove the show. He said he had ""no idea"" that Netflix was not paying him royalties and that he had asked his lawyers to ""look into this and find out what happened"". The comedian also said that he was ""not going to go into a lot of detail"" about the matter, but he wanted to make it clear that he ""will not tolerate"" being ""taken advantage of"". ""I hope that we can come to a resolution soon,"" he said. ""But if we don't, I will take whatever legal action is necessary to protect my rights."" The dispute highlights the complex legal landscape around streaming rights. In the past, artists and performers have often signed contracts that give streaming services the right to distribute their work without paying them royalties. However, there is a growing movement to challenge these contracts and to ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their work. It is unclear how the Chappelle's Show dispute will be resolved. However, it is likely to have a significant impact on the way that streaming services negotiate with artists and performers in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Le Patourel brothers could be set for Guernsey blue plaque honour,"Plans to place the plaque at their former home in the Fosse Andre, in St Peter Port, have been submitted. John Herbert Le Patourel was a leader in the fight to have capital punishment abolished in the British Isles. He was also a campaigner for the rights of homosexuals and for animal welfare. His brother, Clement Le Patourel, was a painter and photographer who was also active in the campaign against capital punishment. The plaque will commemorate the brothers' contribution to social justice. It will also serve as a reminder of the importance of fighting for what you believe in. The Le Patourel brothers were born in Guernsey in the 19th century. John Herbert was born in 1863 and Clement in 1864. The brothers were raised in a religious family and were educated at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. John Herbert Le Patourel studied law at Cambridge University and was called to the bar in 1888. He returned to Guernsey and practiced law until 1905, when he was elected to the States of Guernsey. He served as a member of the States until 1945. During his time in the States, John Herbert Le Patourel was a vocal opponent of capital punishment. He introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment in Guernsey in 1906, but it was defeated. He continued to campaign against capital punishment and in 1943 he succeeded in having it abolished in Guernsey. John Herbert Le Patourel was also a campaigner for the rights of homosexuals. He was one of the founders of the Homosexual Law Reform Society in 1958. He also worked with the Albany Trust, which provided support to homosexuals who had been convicted of crimes.

Covid: Device aids 'virtual' treatment of Leicester patients,"Patients take their own blood oxygen readings using the small device, which is linked to a smartphone app that sends the data to clinical staff. The monitor, known as a pulse oximeter, measures the level of oxygen saturation in the blood, which can drop to dangerously low levels in Covid-19 patients. The data can then be reviewed by healthcare professionals at the trust's Covid Oximetry@Home service, who can provide advice and support remotely. In some cases, the service has been able to prevent patients from needing to be admitted to hospital. Dr Andy Carson, a consultant respiratory physician at University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, said: ""Covid Oximetry@Home has been a real success story. ""It has meant that patients can be monitored and treated in the comfort of their own homes, while also freeing up hospital beds for those who need them most. ""The pulse oximeters are small and easy to use, and the app is very user-friendly. ""Patients have really appreciated being able to take an active role in their own care, and it has given them peace of mind to know that they are being monitored remotely by healthcare professionals."" One patient who has benefited from the service is 70-year-old John Smith. Mr Smith, who has underlying health conditions, tested positive for Covid-19 in January.

Monarch airline awaits package holiday licence decision,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch's licence by 24 hours on Saturday amid uncertainty about the company's future. However, with the deadline now passed, the regulator has yet to comment on whether the airline will be granted a package holiday licence. Monarch, which was founded in 1967, is the UK's fifth largest airline. It operates scheduled and charter flights to destinations in Europe and North Africa. The company has been struggling financially in recent months, and was forced to cancel flights earlier this year. The CAA has said that it will not grant Monarch a licence if it is not satisfied that the airline is financially sound. The regulator is also concerned about Monarch's plans to reduce its fleet and staff. Monarch has said that it is confident that it will be granted a licence. The airline has said that it has a strong business plan and that it is committed to providing a quality service to its customers. However, industry experts have expressed doubts about Monarch's future. They say that the airline is facing a number of challenges, including competition from low-cost airlines and the rising cost of fuel. If Monarch is not granted a licence, it will be forced to cease trading. This would mean that thousands of passengers would be left stranded and would have to find alternative flights. The CAA is expected to make a decision on Monarch's licence in the coming days. In the meantime, the airline is continuing to operate its flights as normal. Update: The CAA has announced that it has refused to grant Monarch a package holiday licence. This means that the airline will be forced to cease trading. Monarch has said that it is ""deeply disappointed"" by the CAA's decision. The airline has said that it will now enter into administration. The CAA has said that it is working to ensure that Monarch passengers are not left stranded.

'Tuition grants affecting Welsh universities',"Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant. Ministers are set to announce a major review of student funding in Wales. Prof Riordan wants the Welsh government to bring in a system of student grants that would replace the current system of tuition fee loans. Under the existing scheme, the poorest students pay nothing towards their tuition fees, while the majority pay £9,250 a year towards their degree. This money is paid back through the tax system once graduates are earning more than £27,295 a year. But critics of the current system argue that it is unfair on students from poorer backgrounds, who often end up with large debts. They also say it has contributed to the widening gap between rich and poor. Prof Riordan said the current system was ""not sustainable"" and needed to be replaced with a ""fairer"" system. ""We need to move to a system of grants that are means tested,"" he said. ""This would mean that students from poorer backgrounds would get more support, while those from wealthier backgrounds would pay more."" He said this would help to ""level the playing field"" and ensure that all students had an equal chance of success. ""We want to create a system that is fair and equitable for all students,"" he said. ""We believe that a means tested grant system is the best way to do this."" The Welsh government said it was ""committed to ensuring that higher education is affordable and accessible to all"". ""We are currently undertaking a major review of student funding in Wales and will be announcing our findings in due course,"" a spokesman said. The review is expected to look at a range of options, including a means tested grant system.

Dr Adrian Boyle, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the service was ""under extreme pressure"". ""We have just had one of the busiest Januarys on record in terms of ambulance arrivals and in A&E,"" he said. ""This means long waits in A&E for patients - and for ambulances waiting to hand over patients.

Celebrities join calls to axe sixth-form 'learning tax',"Unlike schools and academies, sixth-form colleges in England are unable to claim back their VAT costs. The government says they are liable for VAT because they are classified as ""commercial organisations"". This means that sixth-form colleges have to charge VAT on their fees, which can add up to thousands of pounds for each student. The government has been urged to scrap the VAT charge on sixth-form education, with critics arguing that it is a ""stealth tax"" on further education. A number of celebrities have now joined the calls to axe the VAT charge, including actor and comedian David Walliams, singer Paloma Faith and TV presenter Davina McCall. In a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, they said: ""VAT on sixth-form education is a barrier to learning and opportunity for young people. ""It is a stealth tax on further education that is unfair and unjust. We urge you to scrap it."" The government has said that it is ""committed to supporting further education"" and that it will ""continue to look at ways to make the system fairer"". However, it has not yet committed to scrapping the VAT charge on sixth-form education. The Association of Colleges (AoC) has welcomed the support of celebrities for their campaign to axe the VAT charge. AoC chief executive David Hughes said: ""We are grateful to these celebrities for using their voices to highlight the unfairness of VAT on sixth-form education. ""This is a tax that is holding back young people and preventing them from reaching their full potential."" The AoC is calling on the government to scrap the VAT charge on sixth-form education as a matter of urgency. Mr Hughes said: ""We believe that every young person should have the opportunity to access high-quality further education, regardless of their background or financial circumstances.

An Underbelly spokesperson said: ""We have been working tirelessly to secure planning permission and a building warrant for this year's Edinburgh Christmas Market. ""We have submitted all the necessary documentation to the council and are awaiting their decision. We are confident that we will be able to open the market on time. ""We understand that this is a very popular event and we are doing everything we can to ensure that it goes ahead as planned."" The Edinburgh Christmas Market has been operating at East Princes Street Gardens since 2005. It is one of the most popular festive events in the city, attracting over one million visitors each year. The market is due to open on Saturday and run until 4 January 2019. Last year, the market was criticised for being too crowded and expensive. Underbelly said they had taken steps to address these concerns, including increasing the number of stalls and introducing a new pricing structure. The council said it was working with Underbelly to ensure that the market was safe and enjoyable for all visitors. ""We want to see a safe and successful Christmas Market,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are working closely with the organisers to ensure that all the appropriate consents are in place and that the market is operated in a safe and responsible manner.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Martin McGuinness hopeful of welfare deal by middle of week,"Sinn Féin withdrew support for the welfare reform bill last week. The move has raised questions about the future of devolved government and talks have been taking place to solve the impasse. Mr McGuinness told Irish News: ""I think we can and we will get a deal that is fair and equitable."" He added: ""I think we can get it by the middle of the week but we need to see commitment from all sides."" The UK government has said it is ""committed to finding a solution"" that works for all. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said: ""We have been working hard to find a way forward that addresses the concerns raised by Sinn Féin. ""We are committed to finding a solution that works for all of Northern Ireland and we will continue to work with all parties to achieve that."" The welfare reform bill is part of a wider package of reforms to the welfare system in the UK. The bill includes a number of changes, such as reducing the amount of money that people can claim in benefits and introducing a new Universal Credit system. Sinn Féin has said that it cannot support the bill because it believes it will disproportionately affect the poorest in society. The party has also said that the bill is not in line with the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is the peace agreement that was signed in 1998. The agreement brought an end to the Troubles, a period of violence in Northern Ireland that lasted for over 30 years. The Good Friday Agreement includes a number of provisions that are designed to protect the rights of all communities in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin has said that the welfare reform bill breaches these provisions. The UK government has said that it is committed to the Good Friday Agreement. However, the government has also said that it believes that the welfare reform bill is necessary to reduce the deficit. The talks between Sinn Féin and the UK government are ongoing. It is hoped that a deal can be reached that will allow the welfare reform bill to be passed while also protecting the rights of all communities in Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ex-MI6 boss warns over electronic voting risk,"Sir John Sawers told the BBC that casting a ballot with pencil and paper was ""actually much more secure"". He warned: ""The more things that go online, the more susceptible you are to cyber attacks."" But campaigners for electronic voting argue it is more accessible and could increase turnout. Sir John, who was head of MI6 from 2009 to 2014, said the move to online banking during the Covid pandemic had led to a surge in cyber crime. He said the government needed to make an ""active decision"" on whether the risk of fraud outweighed the benefits of increased accessibility. ""I think they have an obligation to make us confident that the systems they are proposing will be safe and secure,"" he added. The government is currently consulting on plans for online voting in some elections in England. It says it will ""not introduce digital-only voting unless and until we are fully satisfied that it is secure"". But Sir John said he was ""not yet persuaded"" that the government had done enough to ensure the security of e-voting systems. ""There is still a lot of work to be done,"" he said. ""I think the government needs to be very careful about this. This is not something that can be rushed. It needs to be done properly."" The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for more accessible voting, said e-voting could make it easier for people to participate in elections. ""We know that electronic voting can be secure if it is done properly,"" said the society's chief executive, Darren Hughes. ""It is important to remember that there are many different types of electronic voting systems, and not all of them are created equal. ""The government needs to ensure that any system it introduces is robust and secure."" Mr Hughes said the government should also consider the accessibility benefits of e-voting. ""For many people, electronic voting could make it easier to cast their ballot,"" he said. ""This could be particularly important for people with disabilities, people who work long hours, or people who live in remote areas."" The government has said it will not introduce e-voting unless it is confident that it is secure and accessible.

Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors,"Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors By Louise Cullen BBC NI News Green Pastures church plans to build an urban village on the edge of Ballymena, with housing, business parks, a hotel and community facilities. Planners recommended the multi-million pound proposal should be rejected, but elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council's planning committee voted five to three in favour. The development will include 430 homes, a business park, hotel, medical centre and shops. The site at Cushendall Road is just outside the town and Green Pastures is also planning to build a church and community facilities there. The church initially proposed 700 homes on the 64-acre site, which had been opposed by some residents due to traffic concerns, but that was reduced to 430. DUP Alderman William McCaughey said the development was ""in the wrong location"". ""We don't want to see green fields and open space sacrificed for profit. That is not what we should be doing and it's not what the constituents who put us here want to see, either,"" he said. However, Sinn Féin councillor Ryan McMullan proposed the application be approved. ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Ballymena and our borough,"" he said. The development has been welcomed by Ballymena's business community. ""This is a very significant development for the town and one which will deliver hundreds of jobs,"" said Ballymena Chamber of Commerce and Industry president John Hood. ""It will create 430 new homes which will help address the current housing shortage in the area."" Mrs Cullen added that the Green Pastures church's application was one of several major housing developments currently at the planning stage in Ballymena. In total, almost 2,000 new homes are expected to be built in the town in the coming years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Ariana Grande says she feels 'broken' after Manchester concert attack,"The US star was not physically hurt, but posted a tweet saying: ""Broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."" The blast happened just after the 23-year-old singer had finished performing. It is the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Speaking a few hours after the explosion, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""Tonight we have seen the worst of humanity. But I've also seen the best of humanity."" He said people had risked their own lives to help others, describing an off-duty nurse who had saved a child's life. Prime Minister Theresa May chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Tuesday morning and praised the ""extraordinary bravery"" of the emergency services. ""This was an act of appalling barbarism,"" she said ""The people who did this want to divide us, but we will never let them succeed."" The Queen said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the attack. ""The whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night,"" she said. ""This was a particularly cruel attack, which targeted young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives."" The attack is being investigated by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit. Police have arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the bombing. The force said he was arrested at 12:30 BST and remains in police custody. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. However, many experts believe the attack bears the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. The group has claimed responsibility for previous attacks on civilians in Europe, including the November 2015 Paris attacks and the March 2016 Brussels bombings. The US State Department has issued a travel warning for the UK, urging US citizens to be aware of the ""increased threat of terrorism"". The warning said that ""terrorists may be planning attacks targeting tourist sites, transportation hubs, and other public areas in the UK"". US President Donald Trump has offered his condolences to the victims of the attack.

Why good economics can make for bad politics,"Why Good Economics Can Make for Bad Politics India's beleaguered Congress-led ruling coalition in Delhi is discovering that, in its attempts to push through major economic reforms, it may have been inadvertently opening itself up to political backlash. On Tuesday evening, its unpredictable ally the Trinamool Congress pulled out of the ruling United Progressive Alliance coalition, destabilizing the government and raising questions about the future direction of India's economic policy. At the heart of the matter is a sharp divide between the government's technocratic approach to economic reform and the political realities of India's complex and fractious politics. For example, the government's recent relaxation of foreign investment rules in a bid to attract capital and boost growth has been met with staunch opposition from several of its coalition partners. These parties fear that such measures will lead to job losses and the erosion of indigenous industries. This clash between good economics and bad politics is not unique to India. In fact, it is a recurring theme in many developing countries, where governments often face the difficult choice of implementing unpopular but necessary economic policies or appeasing their political base. In the case of India, the government's focus on austerity and fiscal consolidation has drawn criticism from the Left, which argues that it is hurting the poor and marginalized. Similarly, the government's efforts to reform the labor market, which include making it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers, have sparked protests from unions and opposition parties. This tension between economic reform and political expediency is often referred to as the ""political economy"" problem. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that has stymied policymakers around the world. In India, the political economy problem is compounded by a lack of consensus on what constitutes ""good economics."" Different political parties and interest groups have competing visions for the country's economic development, making it difficult to forge a cohesive policy agenda. Moreover, the government's credibility has been eroded by a series of corruption scandals, making it even harder to convince the public of the need for austerity and reform. As the Indian government continues to grapple with the political economy problem, it will need to find a way to balance the demands of good economics with the realities of bad politics. This is no easy task, but it is essential for the country's long-term economic well-being.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Germany migrant shelter fire 'cheered by onlookers',"The fire in the town of Bautzen in the early hours of Sunday morning destroyed the roof of a former hotel that was being used to house 101 refugees, mostly Syrians and Iraqis. No one was injured in the blaze but police are treating it as arson.  Saxony, where Bautzen is located, has been at the forefront of resistance to Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy. The state has borne the brunt of the new arrivals, taking in 45,000 refugees last year - about 10% of the national total. Recent weeks have seen a series of attacks on refugee shelters in the eastern state. Local officials said three suspects were seen fleeing the scene and that witnesses had reported hearing people celebrating as the shelter burned. ""It is a miracle that no one was killed,"" said Saxony's interior minister Markus Ulbig. ""This was an act of inhumanity."" The fire comes just days after another refugee shelter was attacked in the town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony. In that case, a group of far-right protesters prevented asylum seekers from entering the shelter, chanting xenophobic slogans. The attacks have prompted widespread condemnation from politicians and community leaders. ""This is a dark day for Germany,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""These attacks are an attack on our values ​​and our humanity."" The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the attacks were reminiscent of the Nazi era. ""We must never forget that anti-Semitism and xenophobia go hand in hand,"" he said. The attacks have also raised concerns about the growing influence of far-right groups in Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has campaigned against immigration and Islam, has made significant gains in recent elections. Some critics have accused the AfD of stoking anti-immigrant sentiment and creating a climate of fear and intimidation. The AfD has denied these accusations, blaming the attacks on a small number of extremists. However, the party's rhetoric has been welcomed by some far-right groups, who see it as giving legitimacy to their views. The attacks on refugee shelters have sent shockwaves through Germany and raised serious questions about the country's ability to integrate newcomers. The government has vowed to crack down on those responsible for the attacks and to protect refugees from further harm. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to stem the tide of xenophobia and violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wild animals circus ban passes first Holyrood vote,"MSPs unanimously signed off the general principles of the ban, which would be the first of its kind in the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said using animals in this manner was ""morally objectionable"". MSPs raised a series of concerns over the impact of the ban, including the livelihoods of circus performers and animal welfare during transportation. Opposition parties broadly supported the legislation, but raised questions about the timing of the ban and whether it provided enough support for the industry to adapt. Scottish Labour said it was ""disappointed"" the government had not provided more detail on a financial support package for circuses. The party's environment spokesperson, Claudia Beamish, said: ""Scottish Labour supports the principle of banning the use of wild animals in circuses, but we have concerns about the timing of the bill. ""We want to make sure that the right support is in place to assist circuses in transitioning to animal-free shows."" The Scottish Conservatives also raised questions about the potential impact on jobs. Rural affairs spokesman Finlay Carson said: ""The ban will put 50 jobs at risk and it is going to make it very difficult for small circuses which use wild animals to operate."" He called on the government to provide a ""proper financial support package"" for affected businesses. The Scottish Greens welcomed the legislation, saying it was a ""landmark moment"" for animal welfare. Environment spokesperson Mark Ruskell said: ""This ban is a victory for animal welfare and a reflection of changing public attitudes. ""We have campaigned for this ban for many years and we are delighted that the Scottish Parliament has taken this historic step."" The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) also welcomed the vote, saying it was a ""great day for animals"". Chief executive Kirsteen Campbell said: ""This is a landmark decision that will spare countless animals from a life of suffering. ""We have long campaigned for a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses and we are delighted that the Scottish Parliament has listened to our concerns."" The legislation will now be subject to further scrutiny by MSPs before it can be passed into law.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Essex County Council HQ swastikas should be removed says UKIP group,"Earlier this week, it was reported the markings on County Hall had been deemed ""potentially upsetting"". The carvings on Chelmsford's County Hall, built between 1928 and 1939, were made by a local stonemason and are believed to be based on ancient Hindu symbols of good luck. However, the swastika was later adopted by the Nazi party in Germany and has since become associated with fascism and racism. As a result, some people have called for the carvings to be removed from the building. In a statement, UKIP group leader John Vasey said: ""These carvings are a reminder of a dark period in our history and have no place on a public building. They should be removed as soon as possible."" Vasey said the carvings were ""offensive"" and ""upsetting"" to many people. ""They need to go,"" he said. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns that have been raised about the carvings on County Hall. We are currently reviewing the situation and will be taking into account all of the views that have been expressed. ""We understand that the swastika is a symbol that can cause offence and we want to be sensitive to the concerns of all our residents."" The spokesperson said the council would be making a decision on the future of the carvings ""in due course"". The swastika is an ancient symbol that has been used by many cultures around the world. However, its association with the Nazi party in Germany has led to it being widely regarded as a symbol of hate and intolerance. In recent years, there have been a number of calls for the removal of swastikas from public buildings and other places. In 2018, the London Borough of Camden voted to remove a swastika from the facade of a building in Hampstead. The decision to remove the swastikas from County Hall will ultimately be up to Essex County Council. The council will need to weigh the concerns of those who find the carvings offensive against the historical and architectural significance of the building.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Leeds war hero's statue could be moved to heritage centre,"Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron, from Leeds, was killed on a bombing mission in Italy. The RAF pilot was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honour, for his bravery in continuing to fly his stricken plane so his crew could bail out. His statue currently stands in Leeds city centre, but a campaign has been launched to move it to the Royal Armouries Museum's new £25m visitor centre. The museum is dedicated to telling the story of the British Army and is already home to a number of war memorials and artefacts. Supporters of the move say the statue would be more fittingly displayed in a place that tells the story of the armed forces and would be seen by more people. However, others have argued that the statue should remain in the city centre as a reminder of Leeds's proud military history. The decision on whether to move the statue will be made by Leeds City Council. A council spokesman said: ""We are aware of the campaign to move the statue of Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron to the Royal Armouries Museum. ""We will be considering all options and consulting with stakeholders before making a decision."" In a statement, the Royal Armouries Museum said: ""We are honoured to have been approached to house the statue of Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron. ""We believe that the museum would be a fitting home for the statue and that it would be seen by more people here than in its current location. ""We are committed to working with Leeds City Council and other stakeholders to ensure that the statue is displayed in a way that is respectful and appropriate."" Flt Sgt Aaron was born in Leeds in 1914. He joined the RAF in 1940 and flew with 105 Squadron. On 12 August 1942, he was piloting a Lancaster bomber on a bombing mission to Turin in Italy. His plane was hit by enemy fire and badly damaged. Despite being wounded himself, Flt Sgt Aaron continued to fly the plane so his crew could bail out. He was eventually forced to abandon the plane himself but was killed when his parachute failed to open. Flt Sgt Aaron was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery. The citation for his award reads: ""For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the face of the enemy. ""Flight Sergeant Aaron pressed home his attack with the utmost determination, in spite of heavy opposition, until his aircraft was set on fire.

Hong Kong student's death sparks impromptu protests and vigils,"Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation to clear the area on Monday morning. The exact circumstances of his fall are unclear, but reports say he was trying to get away from police who had been firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Chow's death has sparked impromptu protests and vigils across Hong Kong. On Monday evening, thousands of people gathered at the site of his death to mourn and demand answers. They held candles and sang songs, and some chanted slogans against the police and government. The protests continued on Tuesday, with demonstrators gathering in several districts of Hong Kong. They blocked roads, set up barricades, and clashed with police. The police responded with tear gas and water cannons, and several people were arrested. Chow's death has reignited anger and frustration among many Hong Kong people, who feel that the government is not listening to their demands for greater democracy and autonomy. The protests are likely to continue in the coming days and weeks, and could escalate if the government does not respond to the demands of the demonstrators. The death of Alex Chow has also raised questions about the use of force by the police. Some witnesses have accused the police of using excessive force against the protesters, and there have been calls for an independent investigation into Chow's death. The police have defended their use of force, saying that it was necessary to maintain order and protect public safety. However, the Independent Police Complaints Council, which investigates complaints against the police, has announced that it will launch an investigation into Chow's death. The death of Alex Chow is a tragedy, and it is important that the circumstances surrounding his death are fully investigated. It is also important that the government listens to the demands of the protesters and addresses their concerns about democracy and autonomy. If the government does not respond to the demands of the protesters, the protests are likely to continue and could escalate.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

They've allowed these companies to continue operating and people are dying because of it. ""Chris was a vulnerable young man who should never have been given VIP status.

A spokesperson for PT Entertainment said the company was ""committed to responsible gambling"" and that it was ""co-operating fully with the GC's investigation"". Chris's death has highlighted the dangers of VIP gambling schemes, which have been linked to a number of other problem gambling cases. VIP schemes are designed to attract high-spending customers by offering them a range of perks, such as free bets, bonuses and access to exclusive events. However, there is concern that these schemes can encourage people to gamble more than they can afford, and that they can lead to addiction. The GC has introduced a number of measures to try to reduce the risks associated with VIP gambling schemes, including a new affordability check requirement. However, critics argue that these measures do not go far enough, and that the GC needs to do more to protect people from the dangers of gambling.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
US 'preparing indictment against Julian Assange' of WikiLeaks,"The reports came as a filing in a separate court case hinted that charges were being prepared. Justice officials said the filing was made in error. Mr. Assange fled to Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations. He has always denied the allegations. In 2017, Sweden dropped its investigation into the sexual assault allegations, but Mr. Assange remained in the embassy, fearing that if he left, he would be extradited to the United States to face charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of classified US documents. In April 2019, Mr. Assange was arrested by UK police after Ecuador withdrew its asylum protection. He was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for breaching his bail conditions. In May 2019, the US Justice Department announced that it had charged Mr. Assange with conspiracy to hack into a US government computer system. The indictment alleges that Mr. Assange conspired with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain and publish classified US documents. Mr. Assange's lawyers have argued that the charges against him are politically motivated and that he is being persecuted for his work as a journalist. They have also said that the indictment is an attempt by the US government to set a precedent for prosecuting other journalists who publish classified information. The US government has said that the charges against Mr. Assange are not related to his work as a journalist, but rather to his alleged criminal activity. The government has also said that it is committed to protecting freedom of the press. The case against Mr. Assange is expected to go to trial in 2023.

""At a time when the public are being asked to make huge personal sacrifices to stop the spread of the virus, MPs need to be doing their utmost to do the same.

But in a consultation on whether to change it, more than half of the 30,000 respondents thought the wording should be altered to reflect the diversity of members and modern society. The changes would affect more than 300,000 Guides, aged four to 14, across the UK. The organization has published a report on the consultation, which it says shows a ""clear desire"" for change. The three main suggestions are: Removing references to God, Queen, and country Replacing the phrase ""to help other people"" with ""to serve my community"" Adding a promise to ""be inclusive"" The Girlguiding chief executive, Angela Salt, said: ""Our current promise was written in 1930 and has stood the test of time, but language evolves and society changes, and we want to ensure that our promise remains relevant and meaningful to our members today."" She added that the changes would ""make it clearer that Guiding is for everyone, regardless of their beliefs, background or circumstances."" The consultation, which ran from October to December 2022, was the biggest ever undertaken by Girlguiding. Some of those who responded felt that the current wording was too narrow and prescriptive. ""I am a British citizen with a Hindu faith,"" said one. ""The promise as it is now is alienating and exclusive for me and my daughter."" Others said that the changes would dilute the organization's unique identity. ""We are a Christian organization and our promise should reflect that,"" wrote one Guide.

UK retail sales stall in April,"The Office for National Statistics said sales in April were flat on March, and higher than the 0.3% fall expected. In the three months to April, sales increased by 1.8%, with a record quarter for the online sector. The figures suggest that consumers are still spending despite the cost of living crisis, but experts warn that the outlook is uncertain. ""The retail sector has been remarkably resilient in the face of significant headwinds, including the cost-of-living squeeze and the war in Ukraine,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). ""However, we are not immune to the wider economic pressures, and the outlook for the rest of the year is uncertain."" The BRC said that consumer confidence remains low, and that retailers are facing rising costs for energy, wages, and transportation. ""The next few months will be critical for the retail sector,"" said Dickinson. ""Retailers will need to continue to innovate and adapt to the changing consumer landscape, while also finding ways to mitigate the impact of rising costs."" The ONS figures showed that food sales fell by 1.4% in April, the first decline since September 2021. Non-food sales increased by 0.6%, with strong growth in clothing and footwear. Online sales continued to grow strongly, rising by 8.2% in April. This is the highest quarterly growth rate since the start of the pandemic. The ONS said that the increase in online sales was driven by strong demand for clothing, footwear, and household goods. ""The online sector continues to benefit from the shift to online shopping that occurred during the pandemic,"" said ONS statistician Rhian Murphy. ""However, it is too early to say whether this growth will continue in the long term.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Paul Cleeland: ‘Non-disclosure’ claim over 1972 murder,"Paul Cleeland: ‘Non-disclosure’ claim over 1972 murder By Tanya Gupta BBC News Paul Cleeland has made a fresh request to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to revisit his case. He served 26 years for the murder of Terry Clark, who was found dead in a derelict building in Rotherham in 1972. Mr Cleeland, now 70, has always maintained his innocence. He was released on licence in 1999, and his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2006 after it found vital evidence had not been disclosed to his defence team at the time of his trial. In 2012, an independent review of Mr Cleeland's case found there had been ""a serious miscarriage of justice"" and described the police investigation as ""woefully inadequate"". It also found that officers had put ""improper pressure"" on witnesses. However, the CCRC refused to refer Mr Cleeland's case back to the Court of Appeal, saying it was not satisfied that the conviction was unsafe. Mr Cleeland has now submitted a fresh application to the CCRC, arguing that new evidence has come to light which shows that the police failed to disclose a number of key documents to his defence team. The documents include: A statement from a witness who saw Mr Cleeland leaving the scene of the murder with another man. A report from a forensic scientist which concluded that the blood found on Mr Cleeland's clothing did not match the victim's blood. A transcript of a telephone conversation between a police officer and a witness which suggests that the police were aware of Mr Cleeland's innocence. Mr Cleeland's solicitor, Mark Newby, said: ""These documents are highly significant and they should have been disclosed to the defence at the time of the trial. They would have had a material impact on the outcome of the case."" The CCRC has confirmed that it has received Mr Cleeland's application and is considering whether to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal. Mr Cleeland said: ""I have always maintained my innocence and I am determined to clear my name. I hope that the CCRC will finally agree to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal so that I can have a fair trial."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We are aware of the application made to the CCRC. We will be co-operating fully with their investigation.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Millicent Fawcett to be first woman statue in Parliament Square,"The equal rights campaigner who dedicated her life to getting the women's vote, will stand alongside Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Theresa May said Dame Millicent ""continues to inspire the next generation"" of women, and that her statue will show young girls they can ""achieve anything they set their mind to."" Fawcett was a leading figure in the women's suffrage movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was the founder and president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), and she played a key role in the campaign for women's right to vote. Fawcett's statue will be the first of a woman in Parliament Square, which is home to statues of some of Britain's most famous historical figures. The statue has been designed by Gillian Wearing, a Turner Prize-winning artist. The statue will be unveiled in 2022, which will mark the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act, which gave women the right to vote. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a fitting tribute to a woman who made a significant contribution to British history. Her statue will be a reminder of the long struggle for women's rights, and it will inspire future generations of women to fight for equality. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a reminder of the progress that has been made in the fight for women's rights, but it is also a reminder that there is still more to be done. Women around the world still face discrimination and violence, and they are still underrepresented in positions of power. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a call to action. It is a reminder that we must continue to fight for equality for women, and that we must not rest until women are truly equal in all aspects of life. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a symbol of hope. It is a reminder that change is possible, and that even the most difficult battles can be won. The statue of Millicent Fawcett is a tribute to a woman who dedicated her life to fighting for equality, and it is an inspiration to us all to continue her work.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Nóra Quoirin: 'Compelling evidence' of abduction,"Nóra Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast, disappeared from her room at the Dusun resort on 4 August 2019. Her body was found 10 days later about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the resort in a rainforest. The post-mortem examination found that Nóra died as a result of starvation and stress. In announcing the results of the second inquest, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said there was ""compelling evidence"" that Nóra had been abducted. She said: ""I find that it is more likely than not that Nóra was abducted from the Dusun resort on the night of 3 August 2019 and that she was taken to the location where she was found deceased."" The coroner said that Nóra's disappearance had been ""a mystery from the start"" and that she had considered ""all possible scenarios"". She said: ""I have considered all the possible scenarios, including the possibility that Nóra wandered off and got lost, but I do not find this to be a likely explanation. ""I have also considered the possibility that Nóra was killed by a wild animal, but I do not find this to be a likely explanation either."" The coroner said that the key piece of evidence in the case was the fact that Nóra's body was found in a stream. She said: ""The fact that Nóra's body was found in a stream is significant because there is no evidence to suggest that Nóra was able to swim. ""I find it more likely than not that Nóra was placed in the stream after she died."" The coroner said that she had also considered the possibility that Nóra had been killed by a human being. She said: ""I cannot rule out the possibility that Nóra was killed by a human being, but I do not find this to be the most likely explanation."" The coroner said that she had come to her conclusion after considering all the evidence in the case. She said: ""I have come to this conclusion after considering all the evidence in the case, including the post-mortem examination report, the scene examination report, and the witness statements."" The coroner said that she hoped that her findings would provide some closure for Nóra's family.

Waspi campaign: The fight against changes to women's state pension age,"By Reality Check team BBC News That effort goes back decades, so to help understand the issue here is some background. How did we get here? From 1948 for more than 60 years men received their state pension at 65 and women at 60. However, concerned about the impact of an ageing population and the rising cost of state pensions, in 1995 the government announced plans to equalise the state pension age for men and women at 65. This was always going to be a controversial move and a campaign was quickly launched to oppose it, led by the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) movement. The campaign argued that the changes were unfair to women who had been paying National Insurance contributions based on the assumption they would get their pension at 60. They also pointed out that many women, particularly those who worked in lower paid jobs, had been unable to build up enough private pension provision to compensate for the loss of their state pension for five years. The government did make some concessions in response to the campaign, such as bringing forward to 2026 the date when the state pension age for women would reach 65 and introducing a transitional period during which women born in the 1950s would receive some additional state pension payments. However, Waspi argued that these concessions did not go far enough and continued to campaign for the changes to be scrapped altogether. What's the current status? In 2019, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman published a report which found that the government had failed to communicate the changes to the state pension age adequately, particularly to women born in the 1950s. The Ombudsman recommended that the government should make a one-off payment of £12,000 to women affected by this communication failure. The government has accepted this recommendation and is in the process of making these payments. However, Waspi is still campaigning for further compensation, arguing that the government should fully compensate women who lost out financially as a result of the changes to the state pension age. The government has so far resisted these calls, but the issue is likely to remain a source of political debate for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Fifth of UK women decline cervical smear tests,"Early detection through screening, followed by treatment, can prevent up to 75% of these cancers developing. Yet despite high-profile cases such as that of Jade Goody, who died of the disease aged 27 in 2009, the uptake of cervical screening continues to fall. In England, only 68.6% of women aged 25 to 64 attended a screening appointment in the year to March 2022, down from 83.4% in 2000. The decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including embarrassment, fear of pain, and a lack of awareness about the importance of screening. Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""It is worrying to see that so many women are not taking up this potentially life-saving screening."" She added: ""Cervical screening is not painful and only takes a few minutes. The benefits of screening far outweigh any discomfort that women may experience."" There are a number of things that can be done to improve the uptake of cervical screening. These include: Raising awareness of the importance of screening through public health campaigns and school education programs. Making it easier for women to access screening appointments, by offering them at convenient times and locations. Providing information about the screening process in a clear and accessible way. Training healthcare professionals to be sensitive and supportive when discussing cervical screening with women. By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that more women benefit from the life-saving benefits of cervical screening. In addition to the reasons cited by Dr Saliba, other factors that may be contributing to the decline in cervical screening uptake include: A belief that cervical screening is no longer necessary because of the availability of the HPV vaccine. A fear of being judged or stigmatized for having a sexually transmitted infection (STI). A lack of trust in healthcare professionals. It is important to note that the HPV vaccine does not eliminate the need for cervical screening. While the vaccine protects against the most common strains of HPV, it does not protect against all strains. It is therefore still important for women to have regular cervical screenings to check for any abnormal cells that could develop into cancer. It is also important to remember that cervical screening is a private and confidential procedure. Healthcare professionals are bound by law to protect the privacy of their patients. If you are concerned about being judged or stigmatized, you can speak to your doctor or nurse in confidence. If you have any concerns about cervical screening, please speak to your doctor or nurse. They will be able to provide you with more information about the screening process and answer any questions you may have.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid-19: Northamptonshire was 'hair's breadth' from tier 3,"The county will remain under tier two rules, as it has been since England's second national lockdown ended. Lucy Wightman, director of Public Health Northamptonshire, said people should remain ""vigilant"". The government will review the tiers again on December 16, and it is possible that Northamptonshire could move into tier three at that point. Wightman said: ""The data shows we are still in a vulnerable position, and we are just a hair's breadth away from moving into tier three. ""It is vital that we all remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidance to protect ourselves, our families and our communities."" The latest figures show that Northamptonshire has a rate of 119.7 cases per 100,000 people, which is slightly below the national average of 126.2. However, the number of cases in the county has been increasing in recent weeks, and the government is concerned that the county could soon move into tier three. If Northamptonshire does move into tier three, it would mean that all non-essential shops would have to close, and people would only be allowed to meet in groups of six outdoors. Wightman said that she is hopeful that Northamptonshire will be able to avoid moving into tier three, but she urged people to continue to follow the guidance. She said: ""We all need to play our part to keep the virus under control. ""Please continue to wash your hands regularly, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and keep your distance from others. ""If you have any symptoms of Covid-19, please self-isolate and get tested immediately."" The government has said that it will review the tiers again on December 16, and it is possible that Northamptonshire could move into tier three at that point.

Norfolk and Waveney mental health: Dissatisfaction with care,"The survey, by the Norfolk and Waveney Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), said 40% did not know how to access services at their GP practice. Steven Rose, the STP's lead for mental health, said the issue had been identified as a priority. ""There's quite a lot of work going on at the moment to improve access, for example, developing a single point of access for mental health services across Norfolk and Waveney,"" he said. ""It's really important that people in the area know how to access mental health services as they need them."" A spokesman for NHS Norfolk and Waveney Clinical Commissioning Group said: ""We recognise that there are challenges in accessing mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney, and we are working to improve this. ""We are investing in a range of initiatives, including expanding the number of mental health staff and improving access to services through digital channels."" The survey also found that 32% of respondents had experienced discrimination or stigma related to their mental health. Mr Rose said: ""Discrimination and stigma can have a devastating impact on people's lives, and it can make it even harder for people to get the help they need. ""We need to challenge discrimination and stigma whenever and wherever we see it."" He added: ""It's important to remember that mental health is just as important as physical health, and everyone deserves to access the support they need."" The STP is working with a range of partners to improve mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney. This includes working with Norfolk and Waveney Mind, a mental health charity, to provide a range of services, including peer support groups and counselling.

Welsh theatre company launches translation app,"By Ian Youngs Arts reporter, BBC News Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, the Welsh-language national theatre, has developed the smartphone app called Sibrwd, which means Whisper. It will allow audience members to hear key lines and explanations of scenes in English. The theatre hopes it will help non-Welsh speakers, tourists, and deaf and hard of hearing people to enjoy its productions. Sibrwd is the latest example of how apps and technology are being used to make theatre more inclusive. In 2016, the Royal Shakespeare Company launched an app called RSC Play On, which provides closed captions, audio descriptions, and sign language interpretation for its productions. And in 2017, the National Theatre launched an app called NT Live, which allows audiences to watch live and recorded performances on their phones and tablets. Sibrwd is different from these other apps in that it is designed specifically for Welsh-language theatre. ""We wanted to create something that would help people who might not be fluent in Welsh to enjoy our productions,"" said Elen Bowman, the theatre's artistic director. ""We hope it will make our work more accessible to a wider audience."" The app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play. It is available for all of the theatre's main stage productions, as well as for some of its touring shows. Users can select the language they want to hear the translation in, and they can adjust the volume and speed of the narration. The app also includes a glossary of Welsh words and phrases, and a guide to Welsh pronunciation. ""We hope Sibrwd will help to break down some of the barriers that can prevent people from enjoying Welsh-language theatre,"" said Bowman. ""We want to make our work as accessible as possible to everyone."" Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru is not the first Welsh theatre company to use technology to make its work more inclusive. In 2015, the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff launched an app called Theatr Clwyd, which provides audio descriptions and closed captions for its productions. And in 2016, the National Theatre Wales launched an app called Theatr na n'Og, which provides Welsh-language and English-language content for children. The use of technology to make theatre more inclusive is a welcome development. It is helping to make theatre more accessible to a wider range of people, and it is making it possible for people to enjoy theatre in new and different ways.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Scotland weather: More gales hit parts of Scotland,"High winds battering the coast are expected to ease as an area of low pressure continues to move across northern parts of the country. Flood alerts and warnings have been issued for several areas, with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) urging people to be prepared for flooding. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for wind for much of Scotland, which is in place until 15:00 GMT. The warning covers the Highlands and Islands, Grampian, Tayside, Fife, Central, Lothian Borders, Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway. Gusts of up to 70mph are expected in some areas, with the strongest winds likely to be in the west and north of Scotland. The Met Office is also warning of the potential for snow and ice on higher ground, especially in the north. SEPA has issued 10 flood alerts and three flood warnings for Scotland. The alerts are in place for the following areas: River Spey at Grantown-on-Spey River Deveron at Banff River Don at Alford River Dee at Banchory River Tay at Perth River Earn at Crieff River Leven at Leven River Clyde at Glasgow River Annan at Annan River Nith at Dumfries SEPA is urging people in these areas to be prepared for flooding and to take steps to protect their homes and businesses. The agency is also advising people to avoid walking or driving through flood water, as even shallow water can be fast-flowing and dangerous. The Scottish government has also issued a warning to the public, urging people to be aware of the risks of flooding and to follow the advice of SEPA. The government is also working with local authorities to ensure that they are prepared to respond to any flooding incidents. The weather is expected to improve later today, with the wind and rain easing. However, SEPA is warning that flooding could still occur in some areas, even after the rain has stopped.

Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show,"The adult film star was expected to be one of the housemates this series, which started on Thursday night. But she pulled out at the last minute, and her lawyer said producers ""tried to bully and intimidate her"" into changing her mind. In a statement released shortly before the new series began, Celebrity Big Brother said: ""Stormy Daniels has been offered a place in the Celebrity Big Brother house on numerous occasions. Despite agreeing to enter the house yesterday, Stormy Daniels' lawyer subsequently informed us that she had withdrawn from the agreement and would not be entering the house."" The statement continued: ""Celebrity Big Brother is a reality TV show in which celebrities live together in a house for several weeks, with no contact with the outside world. As such, potential housemates are required to sign an extensive contract which sets out the conditions of their stay. Any failure by a housemate to observe the terms of their contract may result in disciplinary measures, including removal from the house."" Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has said that his client was ""coerced"" into signing the contract and that she was ""harassed and intimidated"" by producers in the lead-up to the show. He has also said that Daniels was offered a ""significant sum of money"" to enter the house, but that she ultimately decided to pull out because she felt that the show was ""not a good fit"" for her. Celebrity Big Brother has not commented on Avenatti's allegations. However, a source close to the show has said that Daniels was ""fully aware"" of the terms of her contract and that she was not pressured into signing it. The source also said that Daniels had been offered a ""fair and reasonable"" amount of money to appear on the show, and that she had been given ample time to consider her decision. The decision to pull out of Celebrity Big Brother is a major blow for Stormy Daniels, who has been hoping to use the show to raise her profile and promote her upcoming book. It is also a blow for the show, which has been struggling to attract viewers in recent years. It remains to be seen whether Stormy Daniels will ever appear on Celebrity Big Brother.

"Australian political parties hit by 'state actor' hack, PM says","The cyber-attack revealed two weeks ago was carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"", he said. But he added there was ""no evidence of any electoral interference"". The nation will face more attacks of this nature in future, he said, and the government was ""taking this very seriously"". The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is investigating the attack, which targeted the Liberal and National Parties, the Labor Party and the Greens. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said the attack was a ""wake-up call"" for Australia. ""This is a serious incident and it's important that we get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""We need to be doing everything we can to protect our democracy from these kinds of attacks."" The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the attack was a ""threat to our democracy"". ""This is a very serious issue and we need to make sure that our electoral system is protected,"" he said. The cyber-attack is the latest in a series of incidents that have raised concerns about the security of Australia's electoral system. In 2015, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was hacked, and in 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics was targeted. The AEC has since implemented a number of security measures to protect its systems, including introducing multi-factor authentication and encryption. However, the government has been accused of not doing enough to protect the nation from cyber-attacks.

Home ownership 'overestimated by official data',"The official estimate of a 64% home ownership rate was too high, the Resolution Foundation said, as many people shared or owners had taken on extended family members during the pandemic. The think tank said this ""disguised"" a fall in owner-occupation, to a true rate of 62%. It said the government should focus on supporting home ownership among lower-income households, renters, and first-time buyers. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the government is ""committed to increasing home ownership"". The official figures count anyone who owns a home, even if they share it with others, as a home owner. Before the pandemic, around one in seven of all households in England contained multiple adult generations, or two or more unrelated adults. During the pandemic, however, that figure rose to one in four as many people moved in with family or friends because of the high cost of housing and the need for childcare. This inflated the official count of home owners by about 300,000, the Resolution Foundation estimated. The think tank said its ""true"" home ownership rate of 62% is in line with other recent estimates. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""These figures expose the government's failure to get to grips with the housing emergency. ""Home ownership shouldn't be a pipe dream for most. But the harsh reality is that our broken housing system is pricing millions of people out of a decent home. ""Millions of people are trapped in the renting trap, unable to save for a home of their own. The government must deliver a new deal for renters and build more social homes.""

Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn,"The start-up's flagship product, the Oculus Rift, is a goggle-like ""immersive"" headset for video gaming. It was developed with funds raised through crowdfunding site Kickstarter, before the start-up went on to receive further investment from venture capitalists. The deal with Facebook could help Oculus Rift gain wider consumer recognition. Facebook said it plans to keep the Oculus team intact, and even to expand it by hiring more engineers. The company also said it would ""work with developers to explore new ways of interacting with each other online"", rather than solely focusing on video gaming. Facebook's purchase of Oculus Rift is the first major acquisition by the social networking company since its $19bn purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp last year. The acquisition is also the latest in a series of investments by Facebook in virtual reality, a technology that allows users to experience simulated environments as if they are real. In March this year, Facebook bought virtual reality production company, Surreal Vision. It also formed a virtual reality team at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. And in June, Facebook announced that it was developing a virtual reality headset that users could control with their thoughts. The latest deal is further evidence of Facebook's commitment to virtual reality, a technology that many see as the future of entertainment and communication. It is not yet clear how Facebook plans to integrate Oculus Rift into its existing products. However, the acquisition could give Facebook a significant boost in the virtual reality market. The deal is also a sign of the growing importance of virtual reality. With Facebook's backing, Oculus Rift is now one of the most high-profile virtual reality headsets on the market.

Lorry drivers who drink coffee 'cut their crash risk',"By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online Australian investigators say they found the link while comparing 530 heavy goods vehicle drivers who had recently been in a crash with 517 who had not. Coffee and other beverages containing the stimulant caffeine helped counter the effects of fatigue, say the researchers writing in the journal Sleep. The researchers from the University of Sydney and the University of Adelaide also found that the more caffeine the drivers consumed, the lower was their risk of crashing. Those drivers who had the highest levels of the caffeine breakdown product paraxanthine in their urine had a 63% reduced risk of being in a crash compared with the drivers with the lowest levels. ""The reduction in crash risk was likely due to caffeine's effects on alertness,"" said Dr Harriet Hiscock, lead author of the study from the University of Sydney. She added that the effects of a single cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink could last for several hours, ""which is the length of a typical work shift for a heavy vehicle driver."" Previous research has shown that the hours between midnight and 6am are when the most fatigue-related truck crashes occur, she added. Fatigue is more common among long-distance drivers who may be working long hours and driving through the night. Dr Hiscock recommended that heavy vehicle drivers with long work hours should consider increasing their intake of caffeine, such as by drinking two to three cups of coffee before starting work and having more as the work shift progresses. ""The risk of consuming too much caffeine and experiencing side-effects like insomnia is very low in healthy adults,"" she said. ""The benefits of consuming caffeine to reduce fatigue and crash risk appear to outweigh any risks associated with moderate caffeine intake."" The researchers say that studies have shown that caffeine can help with alertness, attention, memory and reaction time. It can also reduce feelings of fatigue and sleepiness. Dr Hiscock said that in addition to consuming caffeine, drivers should take breaks when they feel fatigued, avoid working long hours and avoid driving while on medication that causes drowsiness. She said that there was also a need for more research to examine the relationship between caffeine and other factors that can affect crash risk, such as age, experience, and road and traffic conditions. ""In the meantime,"" she said, ""caffeine appears to be a useful strategy for reducing the risk of fatigue-related crashes in heavy vehicle drivers.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Richard Wadani: Austrian Nazi deserter dies aged 97,"Richard Wadani was drafted into the German army but escaped on his second attempt in 1944, going on to serve in a British-led unit. After the end of the conflict, he helped prosecute his former comrades and settled in the UK. Born in April 1925, he was the youngest of four children. His family was Jewish, but not religious, and lived in a predominantly Christian area of Vienna. After the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, his father was arrested and sent to the Dachau concentration camp. He was released after six weeks, but the family was forced to give up their business and home. Richard was conscripted into the German army in 1943 and sent to the Eastern Front. He was captured by the Soviets in 1944, but escaped during a train journey to a prisoner-of-war camp. He made his way to Vienna, where he hid for several months before joining a group of Jewish partisans. In 1945, Richard joined the British-led Jewish Brigade, which fought alongside the Allies in Italy. After the war, he helped prosecute Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials. In 1947, he settled in the UK, where he worked as a builder and later as a social worker. Richard rarely spoke about his experiences during the war, but he was a strong advocate for Holocaust education and reconciliation. He visited schools and gave talks about the dangers of prejudice and discrimination. In 2015, he was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, First Class, for his work in promoting understanding and tolerance. He died on 15 March 2023, aged 97. Richard Wadani's story is a reminder of the horrors of war and the importance of fighting against prejudice and discrimination.

""We know the vast majority of people would never dream of doing anything to harm such a special place, but a minority seem hell-bent on destroying it. ""This fire could have easily been avoided and is causing enormous damage to wildlife, the landscape and to people's enjoyment of this area. ""We're working closely with the fire service and the police to identify the people responsible and bring them to justice."" The fire comes just three weeks after a huge blaze on Saddleworth Moor, which took more than three weeks to bring under control, destroyed 2,000 acres of land and cost millions of pounds to extinguish. That fire is also believed to have been started deliberately and police have offered a reward of £50,000 for information leading to the conviction of those responsible. The National Trust said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the recent spate of moorland fires in West Yorkshire and urged the public to report any suspicious activity to the police or the fire service.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
South West Trains 'ice delays' anger commuters,"The rail provider said ice in Petersfield, Hampshire, was causing disruption between Havant and Guildford, in Surrey, on Friday. Commuters took to social media to vent their frustrations, with many complaining of delays of up to an hour. One commuter, who was travelling from Havant to Waterloo, said: ""I've been on the train for over an hour and a half now and we're still nowhere near London. It's absolutely ridiculous."" Another commuter, who was travelling from Guildford to Portsmouth, said: ""I've had to cancel my plans for the day because of these delays. It's so frustrating."" South West Trains said it was doing everything it could to clear the ice and get services back to normal. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We apologise for the disruption caused by the ice. We are working hard to clear the ice and get services back to normal as soon as possible."" The ice delays come after a week of travel chaos on the railways, with many services being cancelled or delayed due to the cold weather. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice and snow across much of the UK, and has warned that further travel disruption is possible. Commuters are being advised to check their journey before they travel, and to allow extra time for their journeys. In addition to the ice delays, South West Trains is also reporting delays on the following lines: The Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour The South Western Main Line between London Waterloo and Bournemouth The West of England Main Line between London Waterloo and Exeter St Davids Commuters are advised to check the South West Trains website for the latest information on delays and cancellations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Taj Mahal: mud-pack treatment for pollution stains,"The treatment is hoped to restore the natural sheen and colour of the white marble monument. It will be the fourth time the 17th century mausoleum has had the treatment. The last mud-pack was applied in 2018. The Taj Mahal is one of India's most iconic landmarks, and is visited by millions of tourists each year. However, the pollution in the surrounding area has taken its toll on the building, and the white marble has become stained and discoloured. The mud-pack treatment is a traditional Indian method of cleaning marble. It involves applying a paste made from clay, water and herbs to the surface of the marble. The paste is left to dry for several hours, and then washed off with water. The mud-pack is said to remove dirt, grime and pollution stains from the marble. It is also said to help to restore the marble's natural sheen and colour. The Taj Mahal is not the only building to have been treated with a mud-pack. The Red Fort in Delhi and the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata have also undergone the treatment. The mud-pack treatment is a relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly way to clean marble. It is also a traditional method that has been used for centuries. However, the treatment is not without its critics. Some experts argue that the mud-pack can damage the marble if it is not applied correctly. They also say that the treatment is not effective at removing all types of stains. Despite the criticisms, the mud-pack treatment remains a popular method of cleaning marble. It is a traditional method that is relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Police chief responds to Fred West 'murder victim' petition,"Fifteen-year-old Mary Bastholm was last seen alive in Gloucester 44 years ago. Gloucestershire Police is being petitioned to carry out a fresh investigation into her reported murder by serial killer Fred West, after new evidence was uncovered by amateur detectives. Gloucester's Police Chief Supt Ian Chisolm, said: ""The remains of Mary Bastholm have never been found and no-one has ever been charged with her murder. ""The investigation into her murder remains open and we will continue to investigate any new information that is brought to our attention. ""In 2015, following media interest in the case, we agreed to review the investigation to ensure that all possible lines of enquiry had been exhausted. ""This review was overseen by an independent detective chief inspector. ""As part of this review, Gloucestershire Police liaised with the relevant authorities in Portugal where Mary's parents were living at the time of her disappearance. ""We also met with Mary's family in the UK to provide an update on the investigation. ""The review concluded that all reasonable lines of enquiry had been exhausted and that there was no new evidence to suggest that Fred West was involved in Mary's disappearance or murder. Pete Moore, who runs the 'Mary Bastholm Murder Investigation' Facebook group, said: ""In 2017, myself and three other volunteers started looking into the case. ""Last year, we took our findings to Gloucestershire Police. ""They said our investigation matched their own but we had taken it a stage further. ""We believe there is enough evidence to prove that Fred West abducted Mary and murdered her at his Cromwell Street home."" Mary's younger sister Janet added: ""We want Gloucestershire Police to follow up on all the evidence that we've presented to them. ""We want them to take a fresh look at it and see if they can find Mary's remains. ""We need to know what happened to her. ""It would be the best outcome if we could find out what happened."" Mr Moore said that the retired officer added he was assisting the BBC in making a programme about the case. The petition states: ""The family of Mary Bastholm and an independent group of investigators have presented new evidence that we believe may finally solve a 44-year-old murder mystery. ""We ask Gloucestershire Police to take ownership of this compelling new information and investigate with the aim of finding Mary Bastholm's body and finally securing justice for her family and loved ones and ending the decades of torment they have suffered.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
GCSE computing tasks withdrawn after answers appear online,"By Judith Burns Education reporter, BBC News The exam board OCR has confirmed the units will be ""replaced"" to avoid the risk of students gaining an unfair advantage. It follows claims that answers to the GCSE exam papers were posted online before the exams had taken place. OCR said it was made aware of ""potential issues"" with the Computing units on 18 May - the same day the exams were sat. The board said an investigation was launched immediately and a decision to withdraw the units was made shortly afterwards. It is understood that the papers had been leaked online and that students had accessed them before the exams. The move to withdraw the units affects students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a statement, OCR said: ""We are aware of some potential issues with the GCSE (9-1) Computing units 1 and 2 that have been brought to our attention. ""As a result, we have taken the decision to replace units 1 and 2 only. ""This decision has been made to ensure there is no unfair advantage given to any students."" The board said it was still investigating the leak and that it would be ""taking all necessary actions"" to prevent a similar incident happening again. It added that it would be providing further updates to students and schools as soon as possible. The move to withdraw the units has been met with anger from some students and parents. One student, who asked not to be named, said: ""I'm really angry. I've been revising for this exam for months and now it's been cancelled because of someone else's mistake. ""It's not fair."" A parent of a student who was due to sit the exam said: ""I'm furious. My child has worked so hard for this exam and now it's been taken away from them.

Small businesses in Scottish council spend call,"The FSB said public bodies should be required to publish regular assessments of how they spend their cash. It argued they should also have to identify areas for improvement. The FSB called for a ""small business act"" to give small firms more representation on public sector boards. The move would create a powerful voice for small businesses to challenge public sector spending decisions. It would also help to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance of winning public sector contracts. The FSB said that small businesses were often overlooked by public sector bodies. It said that this was because small businesses did not have the resources to lobby or tender for contracts. The FSB's call for action was welcomed by the Scottish government. A spokesperson said that the government was committed to supporting small businesses. The spokesperson said that the government would consider the FSB's proposals. The Scottish government has a target of increasing the number of public sector contracts awarded to small businesses to 25%. The target was set in 2014. The government has made some progress towards meeting the target. In 2016, 22% of public sector contracts were awarded to small businesses. However, the government is still some way short of meeting its target. The FSB's proposals would help the government to meet its target. The proposals would also help to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance of winning public sector contracts. The FSB's call for action is a positive step. It is important that small businesses have a voice in public sector spending decisions. The FSB's proposals would help to ensure that this happens.

George Alagiah's debut novel up for author's award,"Alagiah's The Burning Land, is up for the Paul Torday memorial prize, awarded to a first novel by a writer over 60. The thriller's plot revolves around corruption and homicide. It follows the story of Charles Hilary, a headteacher who has rebuilt his life in Kenya 10 years after his wife's death in a car accident.  His existence is challenged when he is drawn into a police investigation of a murder and corruption in a local school. Speaking to the BBC, Alagiah said the book had been ""percolating"" for many years and was inspired by many visits to Kenya and his experiences there. ""It was an attempt to think through some of the dilemmas and issues facing the country, particularly corruption,"" he said. ""I wanted to write a story that is hopeful, ultimately, about people's resilience and determination to live their lives and bring up their families with dignity."" The Paul Torday prize is named after the author of Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, who died of cancer in 2012. Chair of judges Elizabeth Buchan said the prize celebrated ""the most exciting and original"" debut novelists over 60. ""It is a great pleasure to announce the longlist for this year's prize, which contains so many vivid, compelling and original voices,"" she said. Alagiah, who turned 65 on 22 November 2022, is best known to the public as a newsreader, having been a BBC journalist for over 30 years. He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014, and subsequently wrote about his experience in a memoir, The Burning Land, published in 2022. Alagiah said that writing a novel had always been ""a little bit of a dream"" for him. ""I've always found writing very enjoyable, but the news is so relentless and so time-consuming that it was very hard to make the time to do it,"" he said. ""But my illness gave me the opportunity to step back. I've not given up broadcasting, but I'm only doing one day a week now, so I've carved out some time to write."" Alagiah said he was ""thrilled"" that The Burning Land had been shortlisted for the Paul Torday prize. ""It's a great honour,"" he said.

Brexit: Trade deal now looking remote,"Laura Kuenssberg Political editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The big sticking points remain: EU fishermen's access to UK waters, and the UK's plans to potentially undercut EU standards on issues such as workers' rights. Both sides are now saying that, without movement, a no-deal Brexit is the most likely scenario - although they insist they want to keep talking. So what would no-deal mean? Economically, it would lead to tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the UK and the EU - so that means higher costs for businesses and consumers. The food and drink sector, for example, says prices will go up - and some produce might not even be available. Manufacturers and retailers warn of disruption to supply chains. More than just a question of economics, a no-deal Brexit would also mean the UK would no longer take part in EU programmes - for example, the research and development programme Horizon or the Erasmus student exchange scheme. UK universities are worried about how they will continue to collaborate with European partners. And for UK businesses, it means losing the right to trade freely across the EU - they would face new checks and restrictions. For travel, it would mean the end of freedom of movement within the EU. British passport holders would need visas to stay in the EU for longer than 90 days. Tourists would have to check roaming charges. And it would mean British citizens who live in the EU could lose some of their rights. So what about those lorry queues? Under no-deal, there would be new checks and customs controls on goods entering or leaving the UK. If these are not ready by the end of the year, it is highly likely we will see major delays and congestion at ports. This will not just affect UK food and industry, but also businesses in the EU that rely on the UK. This is perhaps one of the most urgent issues that needs to be resolved. And the UK government says it will be ready. It says it has already massively increased capacity at ports, and it will be setting up inland customs sites. But there are many who remain highly sceptical as to whether this is enough. And the government admits that there will be some disruption. For its part, the EU has been planning too. Its negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been setting up lorry parks - essentially giant car parks where vehicles can be stored while awaiting customs checks. The UK wants to avoid this. But no-deal would not just be economically and logistically challenging. It would also be a huge diplomatic headache. The UK would have to negotiate new agreements with countries around the world. It will probably have to join the World Trade Organization and sign up to its rules. And it will have to work out how to maintain open borders with the Republic of Ireland if Northern Ireland is following EU rules. For many people, this would be a big departure from the UK's current position, as a member of a large trading bloc. The government says it will be able to continue to trade with the EU. But it is acknowledged that there will be costs to the UK economy, and that no-deal will make the UK a less attractive place to do business. The EU's message is that it will survive without the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Suspected Tamil rebels shot dead in Sri Lanka,"By Charles Haviland BBC News, Colombo It says they were taking instructions from two LTTE leaders based in Europe. The reported incident, if true, is the first such admission by the Sri Lankan authorities of extra-judicial killings carried out in the final phase of the civil war. Tamil politicians told the BBC that the men killed were suspected of links to the LTTE but not of involvement in violence. They said the men were shot after they tried to flee a house that had been surrounded by the military in the final months of the conflict. The LTTE was defeated in May 2009 after a 26-year campaign for an independent Tamil homeland. The Sri Lankan government has been accused of serious human rights abuses during the final months of the war, including the extra-judicial killing of suspected Tamil Tiger rebels. The government denies the allegations, but a UN panel appointed by then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon concluded that the Sri Lankan military had been responsible for ""credible allegations"" of extra-judicial killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. The group of men now reported to have been shot dead is said to have included a former town mayor, a local councillor and several businessmen. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main Tamil political party, has called for an independent investigation into the killings. The government has not commented on the allegations. The reported incident has taken place against a backdrop of growing international pressure on Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of war crimes and other human rights abuses committed during the final months of the civil war. In March, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling on Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the UN panel and to establish a credible mechanism to investigate allegations of war crimes. The Sri Lankan government has said that it will not accept any external interference in its internal affairs. However, the international community is likely to continue to press for accountability for the alleged crimes committed during the war. The reported incident is a reminder of the dark chapter in Sri Lanka's history and of the need for the country to confront its past in order to build a truly reconciled and peaceful future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Wirelessly charged electric buses set for Milton Keynes,"By Neil Bowdler Science and technology reporter, BBC News A fleet of eight new electric vehicles will operate along a busy route in Milton Keynes from late January. The buses can run for longer than previous models because they are fitted with wireless charging technology, avoiding the need for regular overnight charging.  Rapid charging points are located at bus stops along the H5 route, which connects the new university quarter to the city centre via Milton Keynes Central railway station. The vehicles will charge for four minutes while passengers get on and off at the stops. The buses, which are made by Chinese company Yutong and are known as E12s, are replacing diesel vehicles on the route. Each bus can carry up to 90 passengers. Wireless charging is achieved through the use of a charging plate installed under the road at bus stops. As the bus parks over the plate, it begins to receive an electric current. The system is designed to be efficient and safe, with no risk of electric shocks or damage to the bus or the road surface. The wireless charging system has been developed by a consortium of companies including Milton Keynes Council, bus operator Arriva UK Bus, power company UK Power Networks and infrastructure firm Conduent. Milton Keynes Council leader Pete Marland said: “We are leading the UK in developing innovative solutions to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. These new electric buses will make a real difference to the lives of people in Milton Keynes, providing a cleaner, greener and more reliable public transport service.” Arriva UK Bus managing director Paul O'Neil said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Milton Keynes Council and other stakeholders to bring this exciting new technology to Milton Keynes. These new electric buses will provide a significant improvement to the customer experience, with faster journey times and reduced emissions.” The introduction of the electric buses is part of Milton Keynes Council’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. The council has already invested in a number of other green initiatives, including the installation of solar panels on council buildings and the planting of trees.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Lundy Island visitors return to mainland after ferry failure,"The MS Oldenburg arrived to collect 65 holidaymakers on Saturday but had a mechanical fault and was towed back. The Landmark Trust, which leases the island, found extra accommodation for the stranded visitors. On Sunday, another vessel, the MV Balmoral, was dispatched to the island. The 65 holidaymakers disembarked the MV Balmoral at Ilfracombe, Devon, at around 17:00 BST. One of the stranded visitors, Dave Thornton, said it had been a ""great adventure"". ""We were supposed to be leaving on Saturday morning, but the ferry broke down,"" he said. ""We were supposed to be going home on Saturday, but we ended up staying on the island for two extra nights."" ""The Landmark Trust made us very welcome,"" he added. The MV Balmoral is expected to return to Lundy Island on Monday to collect the remaining visitors.

Essex lorry deaths: Accused made earlier crossing attempt,"Essex Lorry Deaths: Accused Made Earlier Crossing Attempt The Vietnamese nationals, aged between 15 and 44, suffocated as they were transported from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet on 23 October last year. Jurors heard how the victims had been sealed in the pitch black unit with no ventilation or light for at least 12 hours, and that they died from a combination of suffocation and hyperthermia. The six defendants on trial for manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people include Ronan Hughes, 41, of Armagh, and Maurice Robinson, 26, of Craigavon, who are accused of being the ringleaders of the smuggling operation. The other defendants are Gheorghe Nica, 43, of Basildon; Alexandru-Ovidiu Hutanu, 33, of Grays; Christopher Kennedy, 24, of Co Armagh; and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham. All deny the charges. The court heard that Hughes and Robinson had made an earlier attempt to smuggle people into the UK using the same mode of transport. On that occasion, they had successfully transported 10 Vietnamese nationals in a refrigerated container from France to Ireland. However, the victims in the Essex lorry deaths were not so fortunate. Prosecuting barrister Bill Emlyn Jones QC told the jury that the defendants had shown ""callous disregard for human life"" by cramming the victims into the lorry in ""utterly dangerous and inhumane"" conditions. He said that the defendants had known that the journey would be long and dangerous, and that they had deliberately created a situation in which the victims were likely to die. The defense has argued that the defendants were not responsible for the deaths of the victims, and that they had been duped by people higher up the smuggling chain. They have also claimed that the victims had voluntarily entered the lorry, and that they had not been aware of the dangers involved. The trial is expected to last for several weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Golden and sea eagle decline since Dark Ages mapped,"Researchers looked at places named after eagles in Gaelic and Old English to help estimate populations of the birds in AD500. From the Dark Ages, they drew on historical material, such as laws protecting the birds, which are among Europe's largest birds of prey. Golden eagles are found across much of the UK, while sea eagles are only found in Scotland. Numbers of both species fell sharply since the Middle Ages. The study suggests the biggest decline took place between AD800 and AD1100, though this varied regionally. In the Highlands of Scotland, for example, golden eagles made a recovery, with their numbers peaking around AD1200. This is in contrast to the rest of the UK, where numbers continued to fall after AD1100. This detailed study shows how golden and sea eagle populations have fluctuated over the centuries, providing important context for understanding current conservation efforts. Dr Justin Dodd of Royal Holloway, University of London, who led the research, said: ""Our work gives us a better and more detailed understanding of the historical changes in the fortunes of these magnificent birds, and can help inform future conservation action."" The research was motivated by the lack of long-term data on golden and sea eagle populations in Britain. To address this, the team of scientists used historical ecology to look at the spatial and temporal dynamics of the birds over many centuries. The team searched online gazetteers for place names that referenced eagles, such as ""Aird an Iolair"" (Eagle Height) in Scotland and ""Lydd"" (meaning ""eagle"") in England. They found 1,126 place names across Britain that contained the word ""eagle"" or a direct translation. Combining this data with historical sources, including legal documents and medieval chronicles, allowed the researchers to reconstruct the likely distribution of eagles in different parts of Britain at a series of different time periods since AD500. This provides the first detailed historical map of golden and sea eagle distribution and abundance in Britain. The researchers also discovered that the total area across Britain occupied by golden and sea eagles has declined by nearly two-thirds since AD500.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Homeless people struggle to access healthcare, report says","A third of people surveyed by housing charity Cymorth Cymru said health problems contributed to them losing their home. Seven recommendations have been made to health boards and the Welsh government to improve access to healthcare for homeless people. The report, published on Tuesday, found that homeless people often face barriers to accessing healthcare, including a lack of ID, difficulties registering with a GP, and stigma. One in five people surveyed said they had been refused healthcare because they did not have an ID. A quarter said they had been treated with disrespect by healthcare staff. The report makes seven recommendations to health boards and the Welsh government, including: Establishing a system to allow homeless people to register with a GP without an ID Providing training for healthcare staff on how to work with homeless people Setting up outreach services to provide healthcare to homeless people on the streets The report also calls for more research to be done on the health needs of homeless people. Cymorth Cymru's chief executive, Bethan Jones, said: ""Homeless people often face multiple barriers to accessing healthcare, including a lack of ID, difficulties registering with a GP, and stigma.

JVP 'planned to kill' MP,"A senior leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Sunil Handunnetti, MP, is under house arrest by the party after he tried to flee the country, amid revelations that he and his brother had allegedly conspired to kill a fellow lawmaker. Handunnetti's attempted flight follows the arrest of his brother, Upul Shantha Handunnetti, by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on charges of planning to kill Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa, an opposition legislator. According to the CID, Upul Shantha Handunnetti had hired a group of hitmen to carry out the assassination, providing them with a firearm and a down payment of 1 million Sri Lankan rupees (around £4,300). The plot was allegedly hatched in response to an ongoing dispute between Rajapaksa and the JVP. Sources within the JVP have told the BBC that Sunil Handunnetti had been warned by senior party officials to cooperate with the investigation into his brother's alleged involvement in the assassination plot. However, he is believed to have ignored these warnings and attempted to flee the country. The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist party, has a long history of violence and political intimidation, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s when it launched an armed rebellion against the Sri Lankan government. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, the JVP has been active in mainstream politics, but it has continued to face accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuses. The arrest of Sunil Handunnetti and the allegations against his brother have raised concerns about the potential for further political violence in Sri Lanka. The CID is continuing its investigation into the assassination plot, and it is expected that further arrests will be made. The JVP has condemned the allegations against its members and has vowed to cooperate with the investigation. However, critics have accused the party of harbouring individuals who are capable of carrying out violence and intimidation. The allegations against the JVP have also cast a shadow over the upcoming parliamentary elections, which are scheduled to be held in August. The JVP is expected to perform well in the elections, but the revelations about its alleged involvement in a murder plot could damage its chances of gaining significant support.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

I want to apologise to anyone who was hurt or offended by what I said."" Green's comments were widely condemned by politicians from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said they were ""deeply offensive"" and ""completely unacceptable"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had spoken to Green and made it clear that her comments were ""completely wrong"". ""The pandemic has been a terrible time for our country,"" he said. ""It has caused immense suffering and loss. To suggest that it is a 'good crisis' is deeply insensitive and offensive."" Green's apology was welcomed by some, but others said it was not enough. ""She needs to do more than just apologise,"" said bereaved families group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. ""She needs to resign from her position as an MP.""

Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules,"Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules The bill, which now returns to the lower house, also eases fines for some previous illegal clearance if farmers commit to a reforestation programme. Supporters say Brazil needs land for food production, but environmentalists warn of increased Amazon deforestation. The bill reduces the size of the protected Amazon biome by two million hectares (7,700 square miles) and opens up new areas to mining and other commercial activities. It also weakens environmental oversight and enforcement in the region. Environmentalists say the bill will lead to increased deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Amazon, which is the world's largest rainforest and a vital carbon sink. They argue that the government should be focusing on sustainable development and protecting the Amazon for future generations. ""This is a disaster for the Amazon and for the climate,"" said Marcio Astrini, the public policy coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Brazil. ""The government is putting short-term economic gain ahead of the long-term health of the planet."" The bill was approved by the Senate by a vote of 63 to 13. It now returns to the lower house of Congress, where it is expected to pass easily. The bill has been criticized by scientists, environmentalists, and indigenous groups. They argue that it will lead to increased deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Amazon, and that it will undermine Brazil's efforts to combat climate change. The bill's supporters say that it is necessary to open up more land for agriculture and other economic activities in order to meet the needs of Brazil's growing population. They also argue that the bill includes safeguards to protect the environment, such as the requirement that farmers commit to a reforestation programme if they clear land illegally. The bill is part of a broader effort by the Brazilian government to weaken environmental protections in the Amazon. In recent years, the government has reduced funding for environmental enforcement and has made it easier for companies to obtain permits to clear land in the rainforest. The weakening of environmental protections in the Amazon is a major concern for the international community. The Amazon is a vital carbon sink, and deforestation in the region contributes to climate change. The Amazon is also home to a vast array of biodiversity, and deforestation threatens the survival of many species. The international community has urged Brazil to strengthen, not weaken, environmental protections in the Amazon.

Australia to hold royal commission inquiry into banks,"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - would help restore confidence in the sector. Australian banks have been embroiled in scandals in recent times. Mr Turnbull had resisted calls for an inquiry, but the government has come under increasing pressure to act. The inquiry will be led by former High Court judge Kenneth Hayne, who will have the power to compel witnesses and documents. It will examine a wide range of issues, including lending practices, financial advice, and the culture of the banking industry. ""We need to restore trust in our financial system,"" Mr Turnbull said. ""This royal commission will help us to get to the bottom of the problems that have been identified and make sure that our banks are operating in a way that is in the best interests of all Australians."" The announcement of the royal commission has been welcomed by consumer groups and the opposition Labor Party. ""This is a significant step towards cleaning up the banking sector and rebuilding trust with the Australian people,"" said Labor leader Bill Shorten. The inquiry is expected to take about two years to complete. It will report its findings and recommendations to the government, which will then decide what action to take. Scandals involving Australian banks In recent years, Australian banks have been involved in a number of scandals, including: The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was found to have breached anti-money laundering laws on over 53,000 occasions. The National Australia Bank (NAB) was found to have charged fees for financial advice to dead customers. The Westpac Banking Corporation was found to have sold inappropriate financial products to customers. The ANZ Banking Group was found to have engaged in misleading conduct in relation to the sale of financial products. These scandals have led to a loss of trust in the banking sector. A recent survey found that only 37% of Australians trust banks to act in their best interests. The royal commission is expected to shed light on the causes of these scandals and make recommendations for how to prevent them from happening again.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories?,"James Landale Diplomatic correspondent @BBCJLandale on Twitter Britain has 14 overseas territories. They are mostly former colonies and are located all over the world, from Gibraltar and the Falklands to Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and Bermuda. The UK has a legal and moral responsibility to its overseas territories. This is set out in the UN Charter, which states that ""all peoples have the right of self-determination"". This means that the people of the overseas territories have the right to choose their own future. The UK government has said that it will not force any overseas territory to become independent against its will. However, it has also said that it will not stand in the way of any territory that wishes to become independent. The future of the overseas territories is a matter for the people of those territories to decide. The UK government has said that it will support the people of the overseas territories in whatever decision they make. There are a variety of views on the future of the overseas territories. Some people believe that they should all become independent. Others believe that they should remain part of the UK. There is no consensus on this issue. The UK government has said that it will continue to engage with the people of the overseas territories and support them in their decision-making. The government has also said that it will continue to work with other countries and organisations to ensure that the overseas territories are able to prosper and develop. The UK's commitment to its overseas territories is a complex and long-standing one. The government has a legal and moral responsibility to the people of these territories.

Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk linked to skin tears',"Doctors say small tears in the skin from shaving or trimming could make it easier for infections to take hold. But they also say groomers - particularly extreme ones - tend to be more sexually active too. STIs are spread through contact with infected bodily fluids, such as during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. They can also be passed on from an infected mother to her baby during birth. There are a number of different types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Gonorrhea Syphilis HIV Herpes HPV Symptoms of STIs can vary depending on the type of infection, but they may include: Painful or itchy genitals Discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or rashes on the genitals, anus, or mouth Swollen lymph nodes Fever Fatigue If you think you may have an STI, it is important to see a doctor or sexual health clinic as soon as possible. Treatment for STIs varies depending on the type of infection, but it may include antibiotics, antiviral medications, or surgery. There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk of getting an STI, including: Using condoms every time you have sex Getting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B Limiting your number of sexual partners Avoiding sex with people who have symptoms of an STI If you have any questions about STIs, please speak to your doctor or sexual health clinic. Pubic hair grooming and STI risk A number of studies have found a link between pubic hair grooming and an increased risk of STIs. One study, published in the journal ""Sexually Transmitted Infections"", found that women who groomed their pubic hair were more likely to have chlamydia and gonorrhea than women who did not groom their pubic hair. Another study, published in the journal ""The Lancet Infectious Diseases"", found that men who trimmed or shaved their pubic hair were more likely to have HIV than men who did not groom their pubic hair. The researchers believe that the increased risk of STIs among pubic hair groomers may be due to the fact that shaving or trimming can create small tears in the skin. These tears can then provide a pathway for bacteria and viruses to enter the body. Extreme pubic hair grooming Extreme pubic hair grooming, such as Brazilian waxing or laser hair removal, may further increase the risk of STIs. This is because these procedures can remove all of the hair from the pubic area, leaving the skin more exposed to bacteria and viruses. Conclusion The decision of whether or not to groom your pubic hair is a personal one. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with pubic hair grooming, including the increased risk of STIs. If you decide to groom your pubic hair, be sure to do so carefully to avoid creating tears in the skin.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Term-time holiday outlook - what might change?,"However, they maintain the policy to reduce school absence is ""clear and correct"" and they also plan to strengthen the statutory guidance on the issue to schools and local authorities. It was changes to this guidance that led to the most recent row. The government is consulting on a number of possible changes to the guidance, including: Reducing the number of authorised leave days for family holidays from 10 to five. Requiring parents to give schools more notice of any planned absence. Making schools responsible for ensuring that children are up to date with their work when they return from holiday. The consultation closes on 31 October, and the government is expected to publish its final decision in early 2023. Head teachers have welcomed the prospect of a change in the guidance, but they are concerned that the proposed changes do not go far enough. They argue that the number of authorised leave days should be reduced further, and that parents should be required to get permission from the head teacher before taking their children out of school at all. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has also called for the government to go further, arguing that the only way to reduce school absence is to make it a criminal offence for parents to take their children out of school without permission. The government has said that it is committed to reducing school absence, but it is also mindful of the need to avoid criminalising parents who simply want to spend time with their children. It is likely that the final decision will be a compromise between these two competing interests. In the meantime, parents should be aware that the rules on term-time holidays are likely to change in the near future. They should also be prepared for the possibility that they may be fined if they take their children out of school without permission.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Manchester homeless man's shock at Spice use in city,"In the space of a year, William Nicholson said he has noticed a marked rise in use of the formerly legal drug. Mr Nicholson, who spent six months in Manchester in 2016 before returning this May, said spice is now ""rife"" on the city's streets. He said: ""I was shocked when I came back, I didn't realise how bad it had got. ""There are people smoking it in broad daylight, in doorways, on park benches, everywhere you look. ""It's a real problem because it's so addictive and it's causing a lot of harm."" Spice is a synthetic cannabinoid that was first developed in the early 2000s. It is similar to cannabis in its effects, but it is much more potent. Spice has been linked to a number of health problems, including seizures, heart problems, and psychosis. It can also be fatal. In 2016, the UK government banned the sale and possession of spice. However, the drug is still widely available on the black market. Mr Nicholson said he has seen the devastating effects that spice can have on people. ""I've seen people who are addicted to spice and they're just not the same people anymore,"" he said. ""They're withdrawn, they're aggressive, and they're just not functioning properly. ""It's really sad to see."" Mr Nicholson said he is concerned that the use of spice is increasing in Manchester. ""I think it's because it's so cheap and easy to get,"" he said. ""It's also very addictive, so once people start using it, it's very difficult for them to stop. ""I'm worried that we're going to see more and more people dying from spice."" Mr Nicholson said he hopes that the government will take action to tackle the problem of spice use. ""I think the government needs to do more to educate people about the dangers of spice,"" he said. ""They also need to do more to crack down on the sale and supply of the drug. ""We need to do everything we can to stop people from dying from this terrible drug.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Tyne and Wear Metro strike: Commuters and shoppers affected,"The network has been brought to a standstill after talks between operator Nexus and the RMT union broke down. Nexus has apologised to passengers and local bus companies. The strike, which began at 11pm on Monday, is over a pay dispute. The RMT is demanding a 7.1% pay increase, while Nexus has offered 2%. The strike is causing major disruption to commuters and shoppers. Many people are having to walk, cycle or drive to work or school. Local bus companies are also reporting a surge in demand. Nexus has said it is ""disappointed"" that the strike has gone ahead. It has urged the RMT to return to the negotiating table. However, the RMT has said it is ""determined"" to get a fair deal for its members. It has accused Nexus of ""failing to take the concerns of its workers seriously"". The strike is expected to last for three days. However, it could be extended if the two sides cannot reach an agreement. In the meantime, commuters and shoppers are advised to check the Nexus website for the latest information on services. They are also urged to consider alternative modes of transport. The strike is the latest in a series of industrial disputes that have hit the UK in recent months. Workers in various sectors, including rail, education and healthcare, have taken action over pay and conditions. The government has said it is ""concerned"" about the rising number of strikes. It has urged unions to work with employers to find a solution that is fair to both sides. However, unions have accused the government of failing to address the underlying issues that are causing the disputes. They have said that workers are simply trying to keep up with the rising cost of living. The strike is likely to cause further disruption to the UK economy. It is estimated that the rail strikes alone have cost the economy £1 billion. The government has said it is ""committed"" to supporting businesses that are affected by the strikes. However, it has also said that it will not tolerate ""unreasonable"" demands from unions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Virus rebuilds heart's own pacemaker in animal tests,"The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals and if these go awry the consequences can be fatal. In the heart, a small group of cells called the sinus node acts as the body's natural pacemaker, generating the electrical pulses that initiate each heartbeat. But if the sinus node becomes damaged, the heart's rhythm can become irregular and dangerously slow. Current treatments such as pacemakers rely on implanted devices to take over the role of the damaged sinus node. Now, scientists have developed a virus that appears to rebuild the body's own natural pacemaker in animal tests. The technique was developed by a team at the University of Utah and the results are published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The virus is a harmless adeno-associated virus, which has been genetically engineered so that it carries a gene that makes a key protein needed to generate electrical signals in the heart. When the virus is injected into the heart, it infects and modifies a small group of cells within the sinus node. These modified cells are then able to generate electrical signals, effectively rebuilding the heart's natural pacemaker. In animal tests, the technique led to a significant improvement in heart function in animals with damaged sinus nodes. The research is at an early stage and the team is now working on adapting it for use in humans. They are currently conducting a trial in patients with heart problems to assess the technique's safety and effectiveness. Dr Carlos Henrique, who carried out the research, said: ""This technique could potentially revolutionise the treatment of heart rhythm disorders. It could provide us with a way to restore normal heart function without the need for implanted devices."" Heart rhythm disorders - or arrhythmias - are a major global health problem. Irregular heart rhythms are caused by disruptions to the heart's normal electrical impulses. Arrhythmias affect one in four people in their lifetime. They can lead to a range of problems including dizziness, palpitations, breathlessness and tiredness. Some arrhythmias can also be fatal. Current treatments include medications, pacemakers and defibrillators. But these have a range of limitations and can lead to complications. The new technique could provide a more effective and less invasive treatment option for arrhythmias caused by damage to the sinus node.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Brexit: Differences remain over trade deal, say UK and EU","UK negotiator Lord David Frost said ""wide divergences"" remained in some areas, despite progress being made. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said there were ""serious divergences"" over fishing and competition rules. Negotiation resumed last week after a three-week break, but talks broke up at the weekend without agreement. Speaking after a meeting of EU ambassadors, Mr Barnier said the ""essential"" issue of fisheries and the ""crucial"" subject of ""governance"" - including rules on state aid and competition - remained unresolved. ""I regret the UK's position as it stands... It is not up to the task,"" he added. In a statement, Lord Frost said: ""We made progress in some areas but serious differences remain, particularly on fisheries and the so-called level playing field. Resolving these issues is essential for an agreement."" The UK government wants a deal that allows it to set its own rules, while the EU wants to ensure that the UK does not gain an unfair advantage over its member states. One EU diplomat said that the UK was demanding ""the best of both worlds"" - access to EU markets without following EU rules. ""This is not acceptable,"" the diplomat said. ""We are not going to give them a better deal than our own members."" The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains in a transition period until the end of the year. During this time, the UK abides by EU rules and regulations, but does not have a say in how they are made. If no trade deal is agreed by the end of the year, the UK will leave the EU's single market and customs union without a deal. This would mean that tariffs and other barriers to trade would be imposed between the UK and the EU. Many businesses have warned that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging to the UK economy. Lord Frost said the UK was ""prepared to leave without a deal at the end of the year"". ""But we continue to believe that it is possible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with the EU,"" he added.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Australia approves strikes against IS in Iraq,"Prime Minister Tony Abbott said IS was a ""death cult"" that had ""declared war on the world"" and must be stopped. IS controls a broad swathe of territory, spanning a borderless stretch of Syria and Iraq. The group, which is also known as ISIS, has led a campaign of abduction, rape and murder against civilians, and has become one of the biggest security threats to the West. Australia has already committed 600 personnel to the international coalition against IS, including 30 special forces soldiers who will train Iraqi army personnel in Iraq. The government has said it will not rule out sending combat troops to the region if necessary. The decision to approve air strikes was made after the government received a briefing from the chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley. General Hurley said the strikes would be carried out ""as part of the international coalition"", and that they would be ""precise and proportionate"". The government has said that the strikes will be targeted at IS headquarters, training camps and command centers. It has also said that the strikes will be carried out in accordance with international law. The decision to approve air strikes has been welcomed by the opposition Labor party. Labor leader Bill Shorten said that the strikes were ""necessary"" and that they would help to ""degrade"" IS. However, some critics have argued that the strikes will not be effective in stopping the spread of IS. They argue that IS is a highly mobile and adaptable group, and that it will be difficult to target its leaders and headquarters. Others have argued that the strikes could lead to civilian casualties. The government has said that it will take all possible measures to avoid civilian casualties, but there is no guarantee that this will be possible. The decision to approve air strikes is a significant escalation of Australia's involvement in the fight against IS. It is a sign that the government is increasingly concerned about the threat posed by the group, and that it is willing to take military action to stop it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Menzies Aviation workers face redundancy after global travel slump,"The Unite trade union said Menzies Aviation has started a 45-day consultation with staff. Before most aircraft were grounded, the company was one of those providing ground handling for aircraft and baggage. The firm said it had taken “all possible steps” to keep staff employed throughout the pandemic, including furloughing 90% of its workforce. However, it said it now needs to “restructure” its operations to survive the downturn in air travel. Unite regional officer Willie Thomson said: “This is devastating news for Menzies Aviation workers and their families, particularly at this time of year. “The aviation industry has been hit hard by the pandemic but it is also true that Menzies has been struggling financially for a number of years.” He said the union would be “doing everything we can” to support members during the consultation process and would be “pressing the company to do everything possible to avoid compulsory redundancies”. Menzies Aviation is a global aviation services company headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland. It provides ground handling, cargo handling, and fuelling services to airlines at more than 200 airports worldwide. The company has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a collapse in air travel. In September, Menzies Aviation announced plans to cut 400 jobs in the UK, citing the impact of the pandemic on its business. The company said the job cuts would affect all areas of its UK operations, including ground handling, cargo handling, and fuelling. The aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has estimated that the industry will lose $84 billion in revenue in 2020.

Challenge of Redcar blast furnace relighting,"Dave Johnson and Derek Thomas have between them more than 80 years' experience in the steel industry. Both spoke about the huge achievement of reopening the Redcar steelworks, which is now owned by SSI UK. ""It's a massive achievement to get this plant back up and running,"" said Johnson, who is the plant manager. ""It's a credit to the hard work and dedication of everyone involved."" Thomas, who is the operations manager, said that the restart of the blast furnace was a ""critical milestone"" for SSI UK. ""This is a major step forward for the company and for the Teesside area,"" he said. The Redcar steelworks was mothballed in 2015 after its previous owner, Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), went into liquidation. SSI UK bought the site out of administration in 2016 and has since invested heavily in restarting production. The blast furnace is the heart of the steelmaking process. It uses coke, iron ore and limestone to produce molten iron, which is then converted into steel. Restarting the blast furnace is a complex and time-consuming process. It took around three months to complete, and involved the work of hundreds of people. The first iron was produced from the blast furnace on 17 October 2022. This was a major milestone for SSI UK and for the Teesside area. The restart of the blast furnace has created hundreds of jobs and is a major boost for the local economy. It is also a sign of the growing confidence in the steel industry in the UK. However, the challenge is not over yet. SSI UK still needs to raise significant funding to complete the restart of the steelworks. The company is also facing challenges from the global steel market, which is currently in a downturn. Despite these challenges, Johnson and Thomas are confident about the future of SSI UK. They believe that the company has the potential to become a major player in the global steel industry. ""We have a great team of people and we have a great product,"" said Johnson. ""We are confident that we can make SSI UK a success.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Scots NHS staff to receive pay rise denied to English,"By Reevel Alderson BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Scots NHS staff are to receive a 1% pay rise backdated to April 2022, the Scottish government has announced. This is in contrast to England, where staff will not be given the 1% increase recommended by the NHS pay review body. The Scottish government said the pay rise was ""fair and affordable"" and that it recognized the contribution of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Royal College of Nursing in Scotland welcomed the pay rise, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the Scottish government had not gone further. ""This pay award is a welcome step in the right direction, but it is still a real-terms pay cut for our members,"" said Julie Lamberth, the RCN's director in Scotland. ""The Scottish government must now commit to a multi-year pay deal that will ensure that our members' pay keeps pace with inflation."" The Scottish government said the pay rise would cost £125m and would be funded from existing budgets. The announcement of the pay rise comes after months of negotiations between the Scottish government and trade unions. In England, the government has refused to implement the 1% pay rise recommended by the NHS pay review body. The government said it could not afford the pay rise and that it would have to be funded by cuts to services. The decision has been met with anger from trade unions, who have accused the government of breaking its promise to NHS staff. The Royal College of Nursing in England has said it will ballot its members for industrial action if the government does not agree to a pay rise. The pay dispute is the latest in a series of disputes between the government and public sector workers. In recent months, teachers, civil servants and railway workers have all taken strike action over pay and conditions. The government has said it is committed to keeping public sector pay down, but unions have argued that public sector workers are falling behind the cost of living. The pay dispute is likely to continue in the coming months, with unions warning of further industrial action if the government does not meet their demands.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

PC Gordon Semple death: Stefano Brizzi 'spent days' with body,"Stefano Brizzi, 50, is accused of strangling PC Gordon Semple, 59, and attempting to dispose of the remains in an acid bath. He told detectives he ""thought he was getting away with it"" when he spent days with the body before fleeing to Italy. Brizzi is said to have attacked the officer on April 1 following ""a brief discussion"" at his home in Southwark, south London. The pair were known to each other. The Old Bailey heard how Brizzi placed the officer's body in a large bag before keeping it in his living room for several days. Jurors were told he bought a number of items, including bleach, drain cleaner, and a new suitcase, which he planned to use to dispose of the body.

He told the court: ""He embarked upon a series of significant actions in an attempt to destroy the body of PC Gordon Semple."" Brizzi bought caustic soda, which he poured over the officer's body, the court heard. He also attempted to use a circular saw to dismember the remains. When police arrived at Brizzi's home on April 9, they found the officer's body in a bag filled with acid in the hallway. Brizzi was arrested the following day in Dover as he prepared to board a ferry bound for France. Mr. Glasgow said Brizzi, originally from Italy, had been living in the UK for 12 years.

Undercover police: Legal challenge over inquiry,"Dominic Casciani Home affairs correspondent @BBCDomCon Twitter In a legal warning letter to the home secretary, they say one of the officers at the centre of the inquiry was responsible for their mother’s death. The lawyers acting for Jean Charles de Menezes’ family have sent a legal warning letter to the home secretary over a public inquiry into undercover policing. In a legal warning letter to the home secretary, they say one of the officers at the centre of the inquiry was responsible for their mother’s death. The inquiry, set up in 2014, is examining the use of undercover police officers to infiltrate political and social activist groups, and the way these officers have acted while undercover. Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead by police in 2005 after being mistaken for a suicide bomber. The police officer who shot him, known only as W40, was one of the undercover officers at the centre of the inquiry. The family’s lawyers say that W40 was responsible for the death of Jean Charles de Menezes and that the inquiry has failed to properly investigate his role. They are now calling for the inquiry to be halted and for a new one to be set up. The home secretary has said that she will not halt the inquiry, but she has agreed to meet with the family’s lawyers to discuss their concerns. The inquiry is due to report back to the home secretary by the end of 2023. The legal warning letter from the family’s lawyers is the latest in a series of challenges to the inquiry. Earlier this year, a group of campaigners launched a legal challenge to the inquiry’s terms of reference, arguing that they were too narrow. The campaigners’ challenge was unsuccessful, but the family’s lawyers hope that their warning letter will be more successful. The inquiry into undercover policing is one of the most important public inquiries in recent years. It is examining a serious issue that has raised questions about the role of the police and the way they operate. It is vital that the inquiry is able to conduct its work properly and that it is not subject to political or legal interference.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Yemen's Houthis step back on threats to tax aid,"The rebel group, which has controlled the capital Sanaa and much of Yemen since 2014, had said they would impose a 2% tax on all aid entering the country, a move that would have had a devastating impact on the millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance.

The UN envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said that the Houthis had ""agreed to reconsider"" their plans after he met with their leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. The US State Department also welcomed the Houthis' decision, saying that it was ""a positive step"" and that it would ""allow aid to continue to flow into Yemen."" The Houthis' decision to impose a tax on aid had been widely condemned by aid agencies, who said that it would have made it even more difficult to provide assistance to those in need. The UN estimates that 24 million Yemenis are in need of humanitarian assistance, and that 10 million are on the brink of famine. The Houthis have been accused of using aid as a weapon of war, and of diverting it to their own supporters. In 2018, the UN accused the Houthis of stealing food aid from warehouses and selling it on the black market. The Houthis have denied the allegations, but they have been accused of making it difficult for aid agencies to operate in Houthi-controlled areas. Aid agencies have said that they have been subjected to harassment and intimidation, and that they have been prevented from accessing some areas. The Houthis' decision to back down on their threat to tax aid is a welcome step, but it remains to be seen whether they will allow aid to flow into Yemen without hindrance. The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the worst in the world, and it is essential that all parties allow aid to reach those in need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Dame Jenni Murray on why she's taking her clothes off on TV,"Dame Jenni will strip to her underwear on the ITV show to raise awareness of the importance of checking for cancer. The 70-year-old, who has presented Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4 for more than 30 years, will appear on Lorraine next Thursday, where she will be joined by other celebrities including Carol Vorderman, Victoria Derbyshire and Sally Phillips. Dame Jenni said she decided to take part in the show after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. She underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy, and is now cancer-free. ""I'm doing this because I want to encourage other women to check their breasts regularly,"" she said. ""I know it can be daunting, but it's so important. If you find something early, it's much more likely to be treatable."" Dame Jenni's appearance on Lorraine will be part of a week-long campaign by ITV to raise awareness of cancer. The campaign will include a series of films featuring people who have been affected by cancer, as well as information on how to check for different types of cancer. ITV's head of factual entertainment, Kate Teckman, said: ""We're delighted that Dame Jenni has agreed to take part in this campaign. Her story is an incredibly powerful one, and we hope it will inspire others to take action."" Dame Jenni's decision to strip off on TV has been praised by cancer charities. Breast Cancer UK's chief executive, Delyth Morgan, said: ""We applaud Dame Jenni for her bravery in speaking out about her experience. Her appearance on Lorraine will help to raise awareness of the importance of checking your breasts regularly."" Macmillan Cancer Support's chief executive, Lynda Thomas, said: ""We're grateful to Dame Jenni for using her platform to highlight the importance of cancer awareness. Her story will help to encourage others to seek help and support, and to take steps to reduce their risk of cancer.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Karate punching power 'all in the brain',"By Jonathan Ball BBC News In a close-range punching contest described in Cerebral Cortex, experts consistently out-hit novices. Scientists peered deep into the brains of the experts to reveal alterations in two regions related to balance and coordination - the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. They discovered that expert karateka have different patterns of activity in these regions compared with less experienced fighters. It's as if the expert brains have fine-tuned these areas for punching. The study also found that better-skilled fighters showed greater levels of connectivity between the two brain regions. ""I've been training now for 42 years and the movements are almost automatic,"" says Gary ""Tiger"" Mullins, a world champion karate fighter and one of the experts involved in the study. ""I can't think, 'I'm going to do this movement now' - I just do it, and I don't think about it. ""It's good to know what's happening in the brain. It's a bit like magic - you don't know how you do it."" ""Balance control is very important - when you're punching, you need to stay balanced,"" says Prof Etienne Sibille, one of the researchers on the study from the University of Strasbourg in France. ""These brain regions are really important for punching."" The scientists speculate that the changes they observed may have been caused by the act of training. Previous research has shown that the brain is able to adapt to the demands of training, for example by increasing the size of certain brain regions. ""When you train over a long period of time, you can change your brain,"" says Prof Sibille. ""So if you were a karate fighter, you could increase the volume of the cerebellum."" The researchers believe that their findings could help to improve training methods for karateka and other martial artists. ""We hope that this can lead to new ways of training - for example, we could devise exercises that target these specific brain regions,"" says Prof Sibille. ""It's a very exciting area of research and I think it's going to open up a lot of new possibilities in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Respite reported for Scotland's daily newspaper sales,"By Jamie McIvor BBC News correspondent The Scotsman and The Herald both recorded very small rises in their circulations between April and May. This was probably helped by the general election. However The Courier and The Press and Journal suffered falls in their circulation. The figures from the industry body Newsworks show a decline of 4.8% in Scotland's daily newspaper market over the past year, with an average sale of 460,318 copies per day. Sunday papers in Scotland saw larger circulation rises, but the increase of 8.9% was based on only 387,000 copies sold each day. It means total newspaper sales have fallen 4.7% over the past year with 847,318 papers being sold each day, down 41,426. On a UK basis, the Daily Mail saw a small circulation rise of 0.4% and is now the UK's biggest selling daily newspaper, ahead of The Sun. The Times, The Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, The Guardian and The Independent all saw falls in their circulation during May. Sunday newspaper sales were down 5.8% across the UK in May, with only the Mail on Sunday and The Sunday Times recording increases. The market for print newspapers has been in long-term decline, with readers increasingly getting their news online. The shift towards digital is a particular concern for regional newspapers, which rely more heavily on print sales than national titles. In Scotland, The Scotsman and The Herald have both launched digital subscription services in an attempt to boost revenue. The Courier and The Press and Journal have also been investing in digital, but they have not yet seen the same level of success as their rivals. The latest circulation figures from Newsworks show that newspapers are facing a tough battle to retain readers. The industry is hoping that the introduction of new technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, will help to attract new readers. However, it is clear that print newspapers will continue to face challenges in the coming years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Apple apologises and fixes security flaw,"Dave Lee North America technology reporter The flaw, revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. The latest version of macOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and apologize to all our customers, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the fact that it took us so long to correct it,"" Apple said in a statement. The security flaw was discovered by researcher Cedric Owens and responsibly disclosed to Apple. Owens said the bug could have been exploited in several scenarios, including phishing attacks. ""An attacker could have sent a malicious link to a victim, and once the victim clicked on the link, the attacker would have been able to gain full control of the victim's Mac,"" Owens said. ""This could have been used to steal sensitive data, install malware, or even take complete control of the victim's Mac."" The security update, which is available now, fixes the flaw and prevents attackers from exploiting it. Apple also recommends that users update their software to the latest version. This is not the first time that Apple has been criticized for its security practices. In 2018, the company was criticized for a security flaw that allowed attackers to access users' iCloud accounts without a password. Apple also came under fire in 2017 for a security flaw that allowed attackers to install malware on Macs without the user's knowledge. Apple has said that it is committed to improving its security practices. The company has hired more security engineers and has invested in new security technologies. However, the recent security flaw shows that Apple still has work to do. Apple's security flaws have raised concerns about the security of the company's products. Some experts have said that Apple's products are not as secure as they could be. Others have said that Apple is not doing enough to protect its users from cyberattacks. Apple has defended its security practices, saying that its products are among the most secure in the industry. The company has also said that it is constantly working to improve its security measures.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Brexit: Corbyn aides warn against pre-election referendum,"By Iain Watson Political correspondent, BBC News These senior aides are concerned he is being pushed into a position which would delay a general election for some months by the shadow cabinet's Brexit policy spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer. A second referendum would effectively give the public a direct say on whether they want to leave the EU or not and would therefore change Labour's current policy. It would also open up the possibility of delays to the whole Brexit process because, if the public voted to remain, the government would have to extend its discussions with the EU. Mr Corbyn is facing calls to consider a second referendum on his own terms in order to unite the party but some of his closest allies are vehemently opposed to one. One senior aide told the BBC: ""A referendum would be a huge gamble for us and could open up big divisions in the party. ""Our main focus should be on winning the next election and we have to be careful not to get bogged down in Brexit, which is still a big problem for us."" The shadow cabinet will consider the proposal again on Tuesday, the BBC understands. Speaking at a rally in Harlow, Essex, Mr Corbyn said the referendum ""is an option on the table"". ""It's part of our policy-making process and we will take our time to reach a conclusion,"" he said. ""Our priority is to get a general election, to get a Labour government and to implement our manifesto. ""That means taking urgent action on the cost-of-living crisis, the housing crisis, the climate crisis and bringing our NHS back into public ownership."" Sir Keir has argued that a public vote is the only way to resolve the Brexit impasse. ""The country is deeply divided and many people are losing faith in our democracy,"" he said. ""A referendum would give the public a chance to have their say and would help to unite the country."" However, his proposal has been met with resistance from left-wing Labour MPs, who argue that it would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. They believe that a second referendum would only serve to prolong the Brexit process and would undermine public trust in democracy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away',"The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said huge pumps needed for the water mist system had arrived on site the day before. It was due to go live on 15 June - two weeks after the blaze started. However, there was not enough time to install it before the fire. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the water mist system would have been ""unlikely"" to prevent the huge fire that destroyed much of the art school building on 15 June 2018. Architects had hoped the system would extinguish any blaze within 15 minutes and stop it spreading. The £2m water mist system was part of a major refurbishment project at the art school. It included 243 sprinkler heads and five pumps - one of which was still on a lorry outside the building when the fire broke out. A source close to the project said the pumps had been delivered the day before and two were already in place in the basement. The remaining pumps were due to be installed in the coming weeks. The source said the sprinkler heads had been installed but the pumps were needed to power the system. ""Without the pumps, the system couldn't work,"" the source said. ""It was due to go live on 15 June."" The Glasgow School of Art fire was one of the biggest fires in the UK in recent years. It destroyed much of the art school's Mackintosh Building, which was designed by renowned architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The building is now being rebuilt and is expected to reopen in 2029. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was ""unprecedented"" and that the water mist system would have been ""unlikely"" to prevent it. ""The fire was so intense that it caused the roof to collapse and the building to be gutted,"" a spokesman said. ""It is difficult to say for certain what would have happened if the water mist system had been in place, but it is unlikely that it would have prevented the fire from spreading."" The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said the water mist system would have been ""a valuable addition"" to the art school's fire safety system. ""It is a very effective way of extinguishing fires and preventing them from spreading,"" a spokesman said. ""It is a shame that the system was not in place before the fire.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Pakistanis respond after 'spy pigeon' detained in India,"BBC Trending What's popular and why It all started when a 14-year-old boy in an Indian village close to the border with Pakistan found a white pigeon with a mysterious ring attached to its foot. The Indian authorities were alerted, and the bird was soon labelled a ""spy pigeon"", leading to a diplomatic row between India and Pakistan. However, Pakistanis have taken to social media to respond to the incident with a mixture of humour and anger. Some have suggested that the pigeon may have been sent by Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, to gather information about India's military installations. Others have joked that the pigeon was a peace envoy, or even a ""freedom fighter"". However, many Pakistanis have also expressed anger at the Indian authorities for detaining the pigeon and accusing it of being a spy. They argue that the bird is an innocent creature that should not be used as a political pawn. ""#FreeThePigeon"" has become a trending hashtag on Twitter in Pakistan, with many users calling for the bird to be released immediately. One user tweeted: ""This is a travesty of justice. The pigeon has done nothing wrong and should not be held captive."" Another user wrote: ""The Indian government is making a mockery of itself with this stunt. It's time to let the pigeon go."" The incident has also been met with amusement by some Pakistanis. One user tweeted: ""I can't believe India is accusing us of sending spy pigeons. This is the funniest thing I've heard all week."" Another user wrote: ""I wonder what kind of secrets the Indian government thinks the pigeon was carrying. Maybe it was carrying a message from our prime minister to the Indian president?"" The Indian authorities have not yet commented on the incident, but it is likely to further strain relations between the two countries. This is not the first time that pigeons have been accused of being spies. In 2018, a pigeon with a camera attached to its back was found in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian authorities claimed that the pigeon was being used to spy on Indian military installations, but Pakistan denied the allegations, saying that the bird was a pet. The use of pigeons as spies is a centuries-old practice. In ancient times, pigeons were used to carry messages between armies. In more recent times, pigeons have been used to spy on enemy territory during wartime. However, the use of pigeons as spies is becoming increasingly rare as technology advances. Today, there are more effective and less risky ways to gather intelligence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
A US judge asked lawyers to explain the lyrics to Thriller,"US Tax Court Judge Mark Holmes had always been puzzled by the rap at the end of Michael Jackson's Thriller, so when the star's former lawyer John Branca appeared in front of him, he decided to ask him for an explanation. Branca, who also happens to be the co-executor of Jackson's estate, duly obliged, giving a detailed breakdown of the lyrics. The rap, performed by Vincent Price, is a spoken-word monologue that serves as a chilling epilogue to the song's eerie narrative. It begins with the line, ""Darkness falls across the land,"" and goes on to describe a group of ghouls and monsters emerging from their graves. Price's sinister delivery adds to the sense of dread, as he warns the listener, ""Thriller night is here."" Branca explained to Judge Holmes that the rap was Jackson's way of paying homage to the horror films of his youth. ""Michael was a big fan of Vincent Price and horror movies in general,"" Branca said. ""He wanted to create a song that would be both scary and fun, and he thought that Price's voice would be the perfect addition."" The rap also contains a number of references to classic horror films, such as ""Boris Karloff"" (the actor who played Frankenstein's monster) and ""your local drive-in."" These references serve to further enhance the song's creepy atmosphere. Judge Holmes was clearly fascinated by Branca's explanation, and he thanked the lawyer for his time. ""I've always been a fan of Thriller,"" Holmes said, ""but I never really understood the rap at the end. Now I do, and I appreciate it even more."" Branca's explanation is a reminder of the importance of context when it comes to interpreting art. The rap at the end of Thriller may seem like a strange and out-of-place addition to the song, but when you understand the references and the inspiration behind it, it becomes clear that it is an integral part of the song's overall impact.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
"Belfast homeless: At least five dead since January, says charity","By Andy West BBC News NI There are no specific statistics on those who die during or after a period of homelessness. However, the Welcome Organisation said rough sleepers are dying due to mental and physical illness, as well as suicides and accidents as a result of their situation. Patrick Corrigan, the Welcome Organisation's chief executive said: ""We have been working in the city centre for 30 years and we are seeing more people dying on the streets."" ""What we are seeing now is people who are much younger and that is a real cause for concern, in the past it was people who may have had a dependency on alcohol and maybe in their 40s or 50s might pass away, now we are seeing people in their 20s and 30s."" He said funding cuts were having an impact on the health and welfare of homeless people. ""We don't have the funding to help the people who need our help the most, something has to change,"" he said. The Welcome Organisation runs two centres in Belfast that provide day services to homeless people and those at risk of homelessness. In a statement, the Department for Communities said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths of homeless people. ""We are committed to tackling homelessness and providing support to those who need it most,"" the statement said. ""We are investing over £100m in homelessness services this year, including funding for outreach and support services for those living on the streets."" The department said it was working with the Welcome Organisation and other partners to improve services for homeless people, including those with complex needs such as mental health issues and addiction. The department also said it was working to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place, including providing financial assistance and support to those at risk of losing their homes. SDLP councillor Paul McCusker said the deaths of homeless people were a ""tragedy"". ""These are people who are dying on our streets, in our city centre, and it is a disgrace,"" he said. ""We need to see more funding for homeless services, and we need to see more support for people who are struggling with mental health issues and addiction.""

Tube passengers forced to walk off train in Underground,"Commuters endured another day of misery when services were delayed, disrupted or cancelled on parts of the network. London Underground apologised for the disruption, saying it was due to a ""combination of factors"", including signal failures and staff shortages. On the Piccadilly line, eastbound trains were not stopping at Hyde Park Corner or Green Park due to a signal failure at Hyde Park Corner. This caused severe delays to services between Heathrow and Cockfosters. On the Northern line, there were no trains between High Barnet and Camden Town due to a track fault at Golders Green. This caused major disruption to services between Edgware and Morden. On the Victoria line, there were no trains between Brixton and Victoria due to a signal failure at Victoria. This caused severe delays to services between Brixton and Walthamstow Central. On the Jubilee line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Green Park. On the Metropolitan line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Baker Street. On the Hammersmith & City line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Hammersmith. On the District line, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Ealing Broadway. On the Overground, there were minor delays due to a train fault at Gospel Oak. London Underground apologised for the disruption and advised commuters to check before they travel. The disruption came as London Underground is facing a number of challenges, including staff shortages and a lack of investment. The union representing Tube workers, the RMT, has said that the disruption is a result of years of underinvestment in the network. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said that he is committed to investing in the Tube and making it a more reliable service. However, he has also said that he needs the government to provide more funding. The government has said that it is committed to working with the Mayor of London to improve the Tube. However, it has also said that it cannot provide more funding at this time. The disruption on the Tube is likely to continue for some time.

Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors',"By James Gallagher Health and science reporter, BBC News website The Stanford University team said the findings were ""incredibly exciting"" and would now be tested in clinics. Eventually, they hope AI will help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and personalize treatments. However, they stress the technology is still in its early stages and is not ready to replace doctors. Instead, they will help doctors in the same way a calculator helps an accountant. The AI system is trained on a vast dataset of mammograms and corresponding patient outcomes. This includes images where cancer has been detected and where it has not. The system learns to identify patterns in the mammograms that are invisible to the human eye, and it uses these to make its predictions. In the study, the researchers trained their AI on a dataset of more than 28,000 mammograms and tested it on a separate dataset of almost 2,000 mammograms. They found that the AI system was as good as a human radiologist at detecting cancer, but it was better at identifying benign lumps. The researchers say their system could assist radiologists by providing a second opinion or by highlighting suspicious areas on mammograms for further examination. Dr Michael Abramoff, who led the research, said: ""Our AI has achieved a level of accuracy that is comparable to the best human radiologists. This is a major milestone in the development of AI for healthcare."" However, he cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages. ""AI is not a replacement for doctors. It is a tool that can help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and personalize treatments,"" he said. The next step is to test the AI system in a clinical setting. The researchers are planning to launch a trial in the US later this year. If the trial is successful, the AI system could be used in clinics within the next few years. The research is published in the journal Nature Medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be as good as cancer doctors at detecting breast cancer on mammograms, a new study has found.

Egypt court quashes Red Sea islands' transfer to Saudis,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with the transfer, including activists, journalists, and lawyers who protested against the deal.  The transfer was widely criticized by many Egyptians, who saw it as a betrayal of national sovereignty and a violation of the country's constitution, which states that Egyptian territory cannot be ceded without the approval of parliament.  Despite the public outcry, the government claimed that the transfer was necessary to protect Egypt's security interests and to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia. However, many Egyptians remained skeptical of the government's motives, believing that the transfer was primarily motivated by financial considerations and a desire to gain favor with the Saudi royal family.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia has been a controversial issue in Egypt since it was first announced in April 2016. The deal has been met with widespread opposition from many Egyptians, who believe that the islands are an integral part of Egyptian territory and should not be ceded to another country.  The government has defended the deal, saying that it is necessary to protect Egypt's security interests and to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia. However, many Egyptians remain skeptical of the government's motives, believing that the transfer is primarily motivated by financial considerations and a desire to gain favor with the Saudi royal family.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir has also raised concerns about the future of other Egyptian islands in the Red Sea. Some Egyptians fear that the government may be willing to cede other islands to Saudi Arabia or other countries in the future in exchange for financial or political gain.  The transfer of Tiran and Sanafir is a complex issue with no easy answers. It is a matter of national sovereignty, security, and economics. The Egyptian government must weigh all of these factors carefully in making decisions about the future of Egypt's islands in the Red Sea.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools,"Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools By Robbie Meredith BBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Education (DE) revealed the figure to the Stormont Education Committee on Tuesday. Up until that point, the department had only confirmed cases in 62 schools. The DE said it is not releasing the names of schools with confirmed cases for data protection reasons and to avoid creating unnecessary stigma. The new school term began on 31 August. There are nearly 1,200 schools in Northern Ireland, catering for more than 350,000 pupils. The latest figures come as teachers' unions warned of an ""explosion"" in Covid-19 cases in schools. The National Education Union (NEU) said the number of confirmed cases will not give the full picture as schools are not expected to report cases to the Public Health Agency (PHA) unless they reach a certain threshold. NEU joint secretary Gerry Murphy said schools that are not reporting cases to the PHA have pupils who are positive and ""they are becoming super spreaders"" due to ""the lack of mitigations in place"". ""This is a really serious situation,"" he said. ""We want to see schools open but they need to be safe environments for all concerned."" The INTO teaching union said it had received ""many calls"" from teachers and principals asking what they should do if they have a positive case in their school. John Boyle, the union's general secretary for Northern Ireland, said that in some schools full classes of pupils have been sent home due to one positive case, while other schools have been advised that pupils do not need to go home as long as they wear face coverings. ""That is not acceptable,"" he said. ""Schools need urgent clarification from the Department of Education and the Public Health Agency on how to deal with confirmed cases and what mitigations need to be in place to maintain a safe learning environment."" The Public Health Agency (PHA) said it was ""very concerned"" about the increase in the number of cases in schools. The PHA's head of health protection Dr Gerry Waldron said it was ""important to remember that while children and young people are less likely to become seriously ill from Covid-19, they can still transmit the virus to others"". ""We are urging everyone to take steps to reduce the risk of transmission, including getting vaccinated, wearing face coverings in crowded indoor settings, and washing your hands regularly,"" he said. The Department of Education said it was ""fully aware"" of the concerns raised by the teaching unions. A spokesperson said the department was ""working closely with the Public Health Agency to provide guidance and support to schools"". ""We will continue to monitor the situation and take any necessary steps to ensure that schools remain safe environments for pupils and staff,"" the spokesperson said.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Drones hamper US firefighting efforts,"Lives were put at unnecessary risk because helicopters could not fly, said fire department officials. The helicopters were helping to contain a large wildfire in San Bernadino county over the weekend. Five drones spotted hovering over the fire were thought to belong to members of the public who had flown them into the area to take pictures or videos. Repeated attempts to contact the drone operators and tell them to move their aircraft failed, said fire officials. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is responsible for regulating all airspace, was also unable to make contact. As a result, the helicopters were grounded for safety reasons. Without the aerial support, the firefighters on the ground had to work harder to bring the fire under control. The fire eventually spread to cover more than 1,000 acres. The use of drones is becoming increasingly common, and while they can be a useful tool for taking aerial photographs and videos, they can also pose a serious safety risk to aircraft. In this case, the drones prevented the helicopters from doing their job and put lives at risk. The FAA has strict rules about flying drones in the vicinity of wildfires. These rules are in place to protect the safety of firefighters and other aircraft. If you are planning to fly a drone near a wildfire, please be sure to check the FAA's website for the latest regulations. In addition to the safety risks, flying drones near wildfires can also interfere with firefighting efforts. The drones can create a distraction for pilots and can also damage equipment. If you see a drone flying near a wildfire, please report it to the authorities immediately. The FAA is working to develop new technologies that will make it easier to identify and track drones. The agency is also working to educate the public about the dangers of flying drones near wildfires. In the meantime, it is important to be aware of the risks and to follow the FAA's regulations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Putin critic Bill Browder freed after brief arrest in Spain,"After an hour in custody he was released because the warrant was no longer valid, Spanish police said. Mr Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. Interpol rejected the claim, saying: ""There is no active Red Notice or diffusion against William Browder in Interpol's databases."" Mr Browder is a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has campaigned for sanctions against Russia. He is the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, an investment fund that was once one of the largest foreign investors in Russia. In 2005, Mr Browder's lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and died in a Russian prison in 2009 after being allegedly tortured and denied medical care. Mr Browder has accused Russian officials of murdering Magnitsky and has campaigned for justice for his death. The Russian authorities have accused Mr Browder of tax evasion and other financial crimes. He has denied the allegations and has said that they are politically motivated. Mr Browder's arrest in Spain comes at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West. The UK has accused Russia of trying to interfere in its politics, and the US has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Russian government has denied interfering in the UK's politics and has said that the sanctions against it are unjustified. Mr Browder's arrest is likely to further strain relations between Russia and the West. It is unclear whether the arrest was politically motivated, but it is clear that Mr Browder is a thorn in the side of the Russian government.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Bird family tree shaken by discovery of feathered fossil,"By Helen Briggs BBC News The turacos, or banana-eaters, are today found only in Africa, living in forests and savannah. They are brightly coloured birds with distinctive red flight feathers and green or blue bodies. A beautifully preserved fossil bird from 52 million years ago is shaking up the family tree of turacos and other highly charismatic and colourful birds including parrots, the businesslike hoatzins, and the ground-dwelling curassows. The newly discovered species, named Primobucco jaguaribensis, not only belongs to the turaco family, but is also a direct ancestor of all parrots and their relatives. The fossil, found in Brazil, suggests that the ancestor of today's turacos and the ancestor of parrots were one and the same. Dr Borja Figueirido, lead author on the paper in Nature, from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told BBC News: ""We were expecting to find the fossil of a parrot or a hoatzin relative because that's what we have in the Palaeocene in Brazil. But it looked more like a turaco."" The fossil bird was the size of a pigeon, with a long tail, short wings and remarkably long toes. When the team ""dissected"" its foot bones to see which muscles attached where, they found that it walked like a turaco, too. ""This bird pretty much had the same foot morphology as modern turacos. This is quite astonishing,"" Dr Figueirido said. It was not an easy fossil to study. The specimen is squashed flat, so its skull is difficult to see. Its back was also missing, having fallen off the slab. DNA from the fossil itself could not be recovered. So, the team compared its DNA sequence with that of all living turacos, parrots and hoatzins to place it on their family tree. The researchers found that the DNA of the fossil was a mix of turaco and parrot, proving that the fossil was a missing link between the two families. ""We were surprised to find that the fossil was not only a turaco but also the direct ancestor of all parrots and their relatives,"" Dr Figueirido said. ""It shows that the diversification of parrots and other colourful birds occurred much earlier than we previously thought."" Many scientists had thought that parrots evolved in Australia, because of the high diversity of species found there today. But the new fossil find in Brazil adds weight to the idea that the turaco/parrot ancestor originated in South America and then spread to other continents, possibly flying across the Atlantic Ocean. The fossil bird Protoavis, from about 66 million years ago, is often considered to be the ancestor of all modern birds. It also had long legs and a long tail, not unlike Primobucco jaguaribensis. ""Having two fossils that are so old and show long legs and long tails suggests that this might be a plesiomorphic character - a primitive characteristic that's inherited from the last common ancestor of all modern birds,"" Dr Figueirido said. ""If this is true, then the short-legged, short-tailed birds like chickens, ducks and eagles evolved from long-legged, long-tailed ancestors.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Liposuction rise linked to gym wear trend,"Rajiv Grover, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says latest UK data shows procedures have gone up 12% in a year, from 44,000 to 49,000. The increase has been linked to the ""athleisure"" fashion trend, which has seen gym wear become more popular as everyday clothing. This trend has made it more acceptable to show off the body, which in turn has led to increased demand for cosmetic procedures such as liposuction. Grover says: ""There's no doubt that the athleisure trend has had a significant impact on the popularity of liposuction. In the past, people were more likely to cover up their bodies, but now they're more comfortable showing them off. This has led to a greater desire to have a body that looks toned and athletic."" However, Grover warns that liposuction is not a quick fix for weight loss. ""Liposuction is a surgical procedure that removes fat from specific areas of the body. It's not a weight-loss solution, and it's not a substitute for a healthy diet and exercise,"" he says. ""If you're considering liposuction, it's important to do your research and find a reputable surgeon who can help you achieve your desired results."" Dr. David Jack, a consultant plastic surgeon at the London Clinic, agrees that the athleisure trend has played a role in the rise of liposuction. He says: ""I've definitely seen an increase in the number of patients coming to me for liposuction in recent years. I think this is partly due to the fact that people are more likely to wear gym clothes outside of the gym, which has made them more comfortable with the idea of showing off their bodies."" However, Jack also stresses that liposuction is not a magic bullet. ""It's important to have realistic expectations about what liposuction can achieve. It can't give you a perfect body, and it's not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle,"" he says. ""If you're considering liposuction, it's important to do your research and find a reputable surgeon who can help you achieve your desired results. You should also be aware of the risks and complications associated with the procedure.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
City sanguine on snap election call,"Simon Jack Business editor The pound has gained 1% and although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May called a snap election for 8 June. Still, market watchers are taking a keen interest in the moves because markets are likely to reward the greatest certainty. Currency traders, for example, like to know what sort of government will be in power, what economic direction it will travel in and what sort of trade deals it will seek. The pound has been particularly sensitive to Brexit, a vote to leave the EU, as many investors think a departure will shrink the economy and damage the country's international standing. Sterling fell more than 10% after the Brexit vote and has been fluctuating ever since. It is trading at $1.29, having risen from a low of $1.21 after the Brexit vote. The FTSE 100, the main index of blue-chip shares in London, has drifted in recent months, and has been dragged lower by weaker commodity prices, which have hit mining and oil stocks particularly hard. The FTSE 100 is trading at 7,350, having risen from a low of 6,850 after the Brexit vote. Investors like Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of fund manager GMO, are expecting the stock market to continue to fall. Last week, he said that the US stock market, and the FTSE 100, were ""very dubiously placed"". He warned that central banks will need to raise interest rates in the next few years, which will take the wind out of the sails of the recovery in the stock market. He said: ""I don't think a recession is imminent, but I do think it is close."" However, most economists expect the UK economy to continue to grow this year, although at a slower pace than in recent years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts growth of 1.7% in the UK this year and 1.4% in 2018, compared with 2.2% in 2016. The markets expect a Conservative win because it is seen as the most stable outcome. The Conservatives are ahead in the polls and are likely to win the most seats. However, the pound and the stock market could still fall if the Conservatives fail to win a majority and have to form a coalition government with another party, such as the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National Party. A hung parliament could also lead to a second referendum on Brexit, which would create further uncertainty and could damage the economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Foals: Oxford band go from squat parties to Albert Hall,"By Greg Cochrane Newsbeat music reporter ""There were two things we didn't want to do,"" recalls frontman Yannis Philappakis. ""One was not do a record which was exactly like [2008's] Antidotes. The other was not to do one which was exactly the opposite. ""We knew our sound had to evolve but we also didn't want to alienate the fans we had gained with Antidotes."" Mission accomplished. Released in October 2010, Total Life Forever was a more polished, poppy and experimental affair than its predecessor, but it retained enough of Foals' raw energy and math-rock nous to please their existing fans. Total Life Forever debuted at number eight in the UK charts, and the band spent the next 18 months touring it relentlessly. By the time they got back from their final American date in October 2011, they had a dilemma. ""We needed time off,"" says Philappakis. ""We were totally burned out."" So they took a break and went their separate ways. Philappakis went to study in Los Angeles, keyboardist Edwin Congreave moved to London, drummer Jack Bevan travelled Europe and guitarist Jimmy Smith stayed in Oxford. ""I think it was really healthy for us,"" says Philappakis. ""We'd been going non-stop for so long. We all needed a bit of space to do our own thing."" A year later, they reconvened in Oxford to start work on their third album. ""We went into it with a very different frame of mind,"" says Philappakis. ""We weren't trying to write the next Antidotes or the next Total Life Forever. We just wanted to make a record that reflected where we were at that point in time."" The result was Holy Fire, released in November 2013. It was a more mature and introspective record than its predecessors, but it still had plenty of the energy and excitement that had made Foals one of the most exciting bands in British rock. Holy Fire debuted at number two in the UK charts and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The band toured it extensively throughout 2014, including a sold-out show at London's Alexandra Palace. In 2015, Foals released their fourth album, What Went Down. It was their most experimental and ambitious record to date, and it divided opinion among critics. Some praised it as a bold and innovative work, while others accused the band of losing their way. Despite the mixed reviews, What Went Down debuted at number one in the UK charts and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The band toured it extensively throughout 2016, including a headline slot at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In 2017, Foals released their fifth album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost - Part 1. It was a more experimental affair than its predecessor, and it incorporated elements of electronica and R&B. The album was met with critical acclaim, and it debuted at number two in the UK charts. The band toured it extensively throughout 2018, including a headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival. In 2019, Foals released the second part of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost. It was a more traditional rock record than its predecessor, and it was met with positive reviews from critics. The album debuted at number one in the UK charts, and the band toured it extensively throughout 2019 and 2020. In 2022, Foals released their seventh album, Life Is Yours. It was a more upbeat and optimistic record than its predecessors and it was met with critical acclaim. The album debuted at number one in the UK charts, and the band toured it extensively throughout 2022 and 2023.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows,"Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor HMD Odyssey joins previously announced VR headsets and hand controllers from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer and Asus to form the launch hardware line-up for Microsoft's new Mixed Reality. The Odyssey headset has high-resolution displays with a combined resolution of 3,664 x 1,920 pixels, the widest field of view of any Windows Mixed Reality headset - 110 degrees - and integrated AKG headphones with spatial audio. Samsung says it is also the lightest VR headset on the market at 645g. The wide field of view was described as ""mind-blowing"" by UK technology journalist Gareth Beavis, who tried out the Odyssey at Samsung's launch event in San Francisco. ""It was like I was in a different world,"" he told the BBC. ""The resolution and quality was fantastic. This was a stunning step up from existing VR headsets."" Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform will let people use VR to watch 360-degree videos, play games, and explore virtual worlds. It will also contain features derived from the company's augmented reality headset, HoloLens. These will allow the user's real-world environment to be shown in the headset's display alongside virtual objects. The hardware will start from $499 and will include the headset, two motion controllers and a six-degrees of freedom sensor. The latter will enable smooth navigation around the virtual environment. As well as wired versions, there will also be a wireless version that can be used together with Windows 10 PCs that feature Intel's Wi-Fi Gigabit technology. The devices will go on sale on 17 October, and apps will be available via Microsoft's new Windows Store. AI-powered avatars Microsoft has also announced a software update to the Windows 10 operating system. The update will allow apps to make use of the Mixed Reality headsets via Windows Store APIs. Mixed Reality will also be supported on Xbox One from early 2018, although the Xbox One console will not be powerful enough to drive the best VR visuals. Microsoft has also unveiled a new feature for its Mixed Reality platform called Mixed Reality Capture Studios. This platform will allow people to create and share virtual experiences with others, even those who do not have a Mixed Reality headset. It will use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate ""avatars"" of the users and their environments. These avatars will allow people to interact with each other in virtual reality, creating new possibilities for socialising, entertainment and education.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Poet Philip Gross wins Wales Book of the Year,"Philip Gross's I Spy Pinhole Eye was one of the three shortlisted works for the £10,000 prize. It is the Penarth poet's second major award in a year - a different collection of his, The Water Table, won the Forward Poetry Prize last autumn. The announcement was made on S4C as part of Wales Book of the Year 2020, presented by Welsh actor Siân Phillips and author and broadcaster Damian Walford Davies. Gross was praised for his ""dexterity, intelligence and imagination"" by judges Jason Walford Davies, Dr Mererid Hopwood and Professor Dai Smith. I Spy Pinhole Eye was described as ""a love poem to Wales"" exploring ""the politics and mythologies of language"". Reflecting on the inspiration behind the poems, Gross said: ""I've been living in Wales for over 40 years and I'm interested in the relationship between the Welsh and English language here. ""I'm intrigued by the power of words and the different ways words can be used. I wanted to create a collection of poems that explored that relationship."" Gross, who is a professor of creative writing at Glamorgan University, added: ""Winning the Wales Book of the Year award is a real honour. I always feel a bit nervous when I submit my work for awards, because you just don't know what the judges are going to think. ""But I'm really pleased that they responded to my work in such a positive way. It's a great feeling to know that my work is being appreciated."" The other shortlisted authors were: Cynan Jones for his novel The Dig Gwen Davies for her volume of poetry Lliwiau Llafar (Speaking Colours).

National Farmers' Union condemns flooding plans,"Engineers have proposed creating ponds and bogs on high ground to prevent rainfall rushing down hills and causing flooding. However, NFU president Peter Kendall said farmland was ""far too valuable"". He said: ""We have a finite resource of land in this country that is available for food production. We cannot afford to lose any of it to flooding or any other unproductive use. ""We believe that there are better ways to manage water on high ground, such as through the use of sustainable drainage systems and planting trees. These methods are more cost-effective and do not damage valuable farmland."" The Environment Agency has said that it is committed to working with farmers to find solutions to flooding that do not damage their livelihoods. A spokesman said: ""We understand that farmers have concerns about losing land to flooding, but we believe that the proposed measures are necessary to protect communities from flooding. ""We are committed to working with farmers to find solutions that are acceptable to them and that do not damage their livelihoods."" The government has said that it is committed to protecting farmland from flooding.

Welsh Conservative leader contender Paul Davies 'not grey',"By Aled ap Dafydd BBC Wales political correspondent The interim leader of the Tory assembly group has been described by a party insider as a ""man in a beige suit"". The Preseli Pembrokeshire AM Paul Davies is seen as the frontrunner of the four-person race to become the next leader of the Welsh Conservatives. But who is Paul Davies, and what are his chances of leading the Welsh Tories to victory at the next Senedd election? Born in Surrey to a Welsh father and an English mother, Davies was raised in a Welsh-speaking home in Prestatyn. He was educated at Ysgol Glan Clwyd before going on to study at the University of Wolverhampton, where he obtained a degree in accountancy and law. After graduating, Davies worked as a chartered accountant before being elected to the National Assembly for Wales in 2011. He served as a shadow minister under Andrew RT Davies and was appointed interim leader of the Welsh Conservative group in the Senedd following the latter's decision to stand down in June 2021. Described by one party insider as a ""safe pair of hands"", Davies is seen as a moderate, pragmatic politician. He is not afraid to speak his mind, but he is also a team player and is well-respected by his colleagues. Davies's main rivals in the leadership race are believed to be Jane Dodds, Darren Millar, and Nick Ramsay. Dodds is the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the only non-Conservative candidate in the race. Millar is the AM for Clwyd West and has served in the Welsh Government as Minister for Health and Social Services. Ramsay is the AM for Monmouth and has served as Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology. Davies is the favorite to win the leadership race, but he will need to unite the party behind him if he is to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election. The Tories are currently the third-largest party in the Senedd, behind Labour and Plaid Cymru. If Davies is elected leader, he will be the first Welsh-speaker to lead the Welsh Conservatives since Nicholas Edwards in the 1990s. He will also be the first leader of the Welsh Conservatives to have been born in England. Davies's supporters say that he is the right person to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election. They point to his experience in government and his ability to unite people from different backgrounds. His critics say that he is too close to the Welsh Government and that he lacks the charisma and vision to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory. Only time will tell whether Paul Davies has what it takes to lead the Welsh Conservatives to victory at the next Senedd election.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Iceland mayors object to Google snow,"By News from Elsewhere...as found by BBC Monitoring Jón Páll Hreinsson says this could put overseas tourists off visiting Bolungarvík in northwest Iceland. The mayor of Sweden's reindeer capital is worried about the effects of climate change on the local economy. ""If the snow goes, the whole area will become a sad place,"" says Jörgen Jönsson of Jokkmokk. ""The snow is what makes this area what it is,"" he adds, ""and it's what attracts tourists to visit."" Jokkmokk is famous for its annual Winter Market, where reindeer herders display and trade their wares. But if the snow melts away, the herders will no longer be able to transport their animals and goods to the town. ""The reindeer travel on the ice roads. We can't use those in the summer,"" says Jönsson. ""So if we don't have snow, we don't have reindeer."" The melting snow is also a threat to Jokkmokk's tourist industry. Last year, the town attracted more than 100,000 visitors. But if the snow disappears, the number of tourists is likely to drop. ""People see the snow and think of Sweden,"" says Jönsson. ""If we don't have that, they won't come."" In Iceland, the mayor of a small fishing town is also concerned about the effects of climate change. Jón Páll Hreinsson says the snow is important for attracting tourists to Bolungarvík in northwest Iceland. ""Overseas tourists like to see snow,"" says Hreinsson. ""They might not come here if it's not snowy."" Bolungarvík is a popular destination for tourists who want to see the Northern Lights. But if the snow melts away, the Lights will be harder to see. ""The snow reflects the light,"" says Hreinsson. ""So if there's no snow, the Lights won't be as bright."" Hreinsson says the town council is looking at ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. One idea is to use artificial snow to cover the town's streets. But Hreinsson admits that this is only a temporary solution. ""We need to do something more than just cover the snow,"" he says. ""We need to find a way to stop the snow from melting in the first place.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

'Law change needed' to stop sale of 'legal highs',"The Local Government Association (LGA) - which represents 400 councils - wants the government to adopt a similar approach to that taken in Ireland. Instead of banning drugs on a case-by-case basis, Ireland has banned all ""psychoactive"" - brain altering - substances. Under this law, if a substance has not been specifically approved for human consumption, it can't be sold or possessed. This approach has been successful in significantly reducing the availability of legal highs in Ireland. In 2010, there were 233 reported cases of people being treated for taking legal highs in Ireland. By 2016, that number had fallen to just 39. The LGA believes that a blanket ban on psychoactive substances is the best way to protect people from the dangers of legal highs. A spokesperson for the LGA said: ""We believe that a blanket ban on new psychoactive substances is the most effective way to protect people from the dangers of these drugs. ""Legal highs are often marketed as safe alternatives to illegal drugs, but they can be just as dangerous. They can cause a range of side effects, including psychosis, seizures, and even death."" The government has said that it is considering a blanket ban on legal highs. However, it has also said that it wants to avoid criminalising people who use these drugs. The LGA's call for a blanket ban is supported by some experts. Professor David Nutt, a former government drug advisor, said: ""A blanket ban would be the most effective way to protect people from these drugs. ""It would remove the incentive for people to develop new legal highs, and it would make it much harder for people to access these drugs."" However, other experts have warned that a blanket ban could have negative consequences. Dr Catherine Curran, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Huddersfield, said: ""A blanket ban could lead to people using more dangerous illegal drugs. ""It could also lead to people buying legal highs on the black market, where they may be more likely to be sold counterfeit or adulterated drugs."" The government is expected to make a decision on whether to introduce a blanket ban on legal highs in the coming months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Jeff Koons' Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist,"Christie's in New York sold Rabbit, a 41in (104cm) steel cast of an inflatable created in 1986, for more than $20m over its estimated price. It beats the previous record set by British artist David Hockney's 1972 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which sold for $90.3m at Christie's in November 2018. Rabbit is part of a series of sculptures by Koons that feature everyday objects rendered in monumental scale. The series, which also includes Balloon Dog and Flower Puppy, is intended to challenge traditional notions of art and to explore the relationship between popular culture and high art. Rabbit is considered one of Koons's most iconic works, and its sale for a record-breaking price is a testament to his enduring popularity and influence. The sale of Rabbit also highlights the growing demand for contemporary art by major collectors. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-profile auctions of contemporary art, and prices have been steadily rising. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, as more and more collectors seek to acquire works by established and emerging contemporary artists. Koons, who was born in York, Pennsylvania, in 1954, is one of the most successful and controversial artists of his generation. He began his career in the 1980s, and his work has since been exhibited in major museums around the world. Koons is known for his use of kitsch and popular culture imagery, and his work has often been criticized for being superficial and lacking in originality. However, Koons's defenders argue that his work is a clever and ironic commentary on the commodification of art and the culture of celebrity. The sale of Rabbit for a record-breaking price is a major milestone in Koons's career. It is a testament to his enduring popularity and influence, and it is likely to further increase the demand for his work in the years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Covid: Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix called off for second year,"The events were due to be held from 22 August until 3 September. The news follows the announcement on Monday that the island's borders would remain closed to visitors until at least 28 June. Rob Callister, the island's political member with responsibility for tourism and motorsport, said the decision had been made ""with a heavy heart"". ""It is with a heavy heart that we have had to make the difficult decision to cancel the 2021 Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix,"" he said. ""We know how much these events mean to our visitors, competitors, and the island as a whole, but the safety of everyone involved must come first."" The Classic TT is open to riders on classic motorcycles, while the Manx Grand Prix is for amateur riders. Both events are held on the Isle of Man's 37.73-mile (60.72km) Mountain Course, which is considered one of the most challenging circuits in the world. The Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix were canceled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Isle of Man has been relatively successful in controlling the virus, with just over 300 cases and four deaths recorded since the start of the pandemic. However, the island's government has been cautious about reopening its borders, amid concerns about the spread of new variants of the virus. The decision to cancel the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix will be a blow to the island's economy. The events are estimated to be worth around £10m to the island each year. However, the government said it was committed to supporting the island's tourism industry during the pandemic. ""We understand that this will be disappointing news for many people, but we hope that everyone will understand the reasons behind this difficult decision,"" Mr. Callister said. ""We look forward to welcoming visitors back to the Isle of Man for the 2022 Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0

The many ways to say sorry in Japanese,"In English, you either say ""sorry"" or ""apologies"". In Japanese, there are at least 20 different ways. One of the most casual is ""sumimasen"", which can be used in a variety of situations, from bumping into someone on the street to apologizing for interrupting a conversation. For more serious apologies, there are more formal expressions such as ""gomen nasai"" and ""moushiwake arimasen"". These are typically used when you have caused someone significant inconvenience or harm. The choice of apology also depends on the relationship between the speaker and the person they are apologizing to. For example, you would use a more formal apology when speaking to a superior or someone you don't know well. In addition to verbal apologies, there are also a number of non-verbal ways to apologize in Japanese. These include bowing, which is a sign of respect and humility. The deeper the bow, the more sincere the apology. Another way to apologize is to give a gift. This is often done in addition to a verbal apology, and it can help to show that you are truly sorry for your actions. The many ways to apologize in Japanese can be confusing for non-native speakers, but it is important to remember that the most important thing is to be sincere. If you are truly sorry for your actions, your apology will be well-received, regardless of the words you use. Here are some of the most common ways to apologize in Japanese: Sumimasen: This is the most casual way to apologize and can be used in a variety of situations. Gomen nasai: This is a more formal apology and is typically used when you have caused someone significant inconvenience or harm. Moushiwake arimasen: This is the most formal apology and is typically used when you have caused someone great harm. Arigatou gozaimasu: This is a phrase that is often used to express gratitude, but it can also be used to apologize. When used as an apology, it typically means ""Thank you for your understanding."" No matter which apology you choose to use, it is important to be sincere and to mean what you say. An apology is only effective if it comes from the heart.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Damascus military facilities 'hit by Israel rockets',"Syrian state media said the rockets hit the Jamraya research centre, which Western officials have suggested is involved in chemical and biological weapons development. The centre is located 15km (9 miles) north-west of the capital, Damascus. Syrian witnesses described how they saw two large explosions in the area. Israel has not commented on the explosions. The Israeli military has launched several air strikes on military targets in Syria in recent years. Last month, Israel said it had struck Syrian military targets in response to rockets being fired from Syria into Israeli-held territory. In 2017, Israel admitted to carrying out dozens of air strikes on Syrian military targets, saying it was preventing Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria. Iran is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has been accused of providing military support to the Syrian government. Israel has also expressed concern about the presence of Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist militant group and political party. It is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, the European Union, Canada, Israel, and the Arab League. Hezbollah has been fighting alongside Syrian government forces in the Syrian civil war. Israel is concerned that Hezbollah is using Syria as a base to launch attacks against Israel. In recent years, there has been an increase in tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran has been accused of developing nuclear weapons, and Israel has threatened to take military action to prevent this. The Israeli military has also launched several air strikes on Iranian military targets in Syria. The situation in Syria is complex and there are many different factions involved in the conflict. The Israeli air strikes are likely to further escalate tensions in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
Caption mix-ups 'show lack of respect' for black MPs,"The Evening Standard used a picture of Bell Ribeiro-Addy in a story about fellow Labour MP Marsha de Cordova. The story was about BBC Parliament captioning Ms de Cordova as Labour deputy. BBC Parliament later apologised and corrected the caption, but the mix-up has sparked anger among black MPs. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham, told the BBC that the incident was ""yet another example of the lack of respect shown to black MPs"". ""This is not an isolated incident,"" she said. ""It's happened to me on numerous occasions, and I know it's happened to other black MPs as well."" Ribeiro-Addy said that the mix-ups were not just an inconvenience, but a way of undermining black MPs and their credibility. ""It sends a message that we are not as important as our white colleagues,"" she said. ""It suggests that we are interchangeable, and that our voices don't matter."" Marsha de Cordova, MP for Battersea, said that the mistake was ""a clear case of racial profiling"". ""The fact that my picture was used in a story about someone else, who is also black, shows that the journalist was not paying attention to the facts,"" she said. ""I'm not surprised that this has happened, but I am angry and disappointed."" The BBC said that it was ""very sorry"" for the mistake and that it was investigating how it happened. ""We are committed to ensuring that our coverage is fair and accurate, and we take any allegations of bias very seriously,"" a BBC spokesperson said. The BBC has a long history of making mistakes in its coverage of black MPs. In 2017, the BBC was forced to apologise after it aired a segment in which a white reporter asked a black Labour MP if he was ""standing up to black thugs"". In 2018, the BBC was again forced to apologise after it published a picture of a black Labour MP next to a story about a stabbing in London. The BBC's repeated mistakes have led to accusations of racism and bias. In 2019, a group of black MPs wrote a letter to the BBC demanding that it take action to address the issue. The BBC has said that it is committed to improving its coverage of black MPs, but it is clear that more needs to be done. The recent mix-ups are a reminder that the BBC has a long way to go before it can truly claim to be fair and impartial.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,gemini-pro,0
